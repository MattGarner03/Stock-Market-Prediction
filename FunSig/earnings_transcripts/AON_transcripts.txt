===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-25 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's First Quarter 2025 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in listen-only mode until the question and answer portion of today's call. I'd also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. Important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter 2024 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon PLC. 
Greg Case: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm joined by Edmund Reese, our CFO. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website which Edmund will reference in his remarks. So we want to start by acknowledging our colleague and friend, Eric Andersen. We announced last month that Eric transitioned from his role as president to serve as a senior adviser. And in his 28 years with Aon, Eric played a significant role in advancing our Aon United strategy and he's been a leader helping execute our three by three plan to deliver more value to our clients, and positioning Aon for continued growth. Thank you, Eric, for your leadership and friendship. Turning to our financial performance. We continue to build momentum in year two of our three by three plan and our execution is translating into results that are fully in line with our financial objectives. Our team delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit growth with organic revenue growth of 5%. With this organic growth and the addition of NFP, we delivered 16% total revenue growth. A 38.4% margin contributing to 12% adjusted operating income growth and adjusted EPS of $5.67. And finally, we generated $80 million in free cash flow and returned $397 million in capital to shareholders. Notably, we also announced that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 10%, the fifteenth consecutive year of dividend growth. The quarter's strong operating performance marks a start to 2025 on track and right in line with our expectations. Importantly, we achieved these results in an unpredictable and turbulent business environment that is creating greater complexity for our clients. Within the four megatrends that we referenced, trade, technology, weather, and workforce, trade is currently and clearly top of mind. Today, tariffs have had limited direct impact on our business and financial results. Over the medium term, whether it could be impact to client discretionary spending we believe the demand benefit is also meaningful given the trust we've established with our clients positioning us to support and help them adapt to new trade rules, and to mitigate risk and capture new opportunities. But for many clients, tariffs have challenged the global landscape posing a significant risk. And against this challenge, we are arming clients with real-time insights they need to make better decisions. A few examples include using our supply chain risk diagnostic tool, advising clients on effectively diversifying or reconfiguring their supply chain operations. For tailoring credit solutions like political risk insurance, surety bonds, and trade credit insurance. Advising on human capital issues like restructuring employee stock grabs. Further, our expertise in ABS capabilities are helping clients fortify their operations to maintain stability, despite trade disruptions. Ultimately, our unique and connected capability and the increased complexity of the global trade environment is driving demand for Aon's advice and solutions. On our Q4 call, we highlighted on the back of strong performance in year one of our three by three plan, we were entering 2025 with great momentum. And we've continued to execute in the first quarter. Using ABS capabilities to expand with and better serve clients. Attracting client-facing talent priority areas. And utilizing exceptional NFP capability to accelerate middle market growth which today reached the one-year anniversary as part of Aon. And specifically on NFP. We couldn't be more thrilled to have NFP as part of the Aon family. As we reflect on this year one milestone, we highlight that the business continues to perform in line with high expectations. Our progress guided by the principle of independent and connected, is right on track. Producer retention continues to be higher than pre-deal. The NFP acquisition engine continues to add high-quality middle market EBITDA through targeted acquisitions with a strong pipeline for the remainder of 2025. This quarter is a testament to the power of the combined NFP and Aon. As we absorbed the peak impact of an increased share count from the transaction. With the acquisition now annualized, we expect NFP's contribution to become even more meaningful as we progress through 2025. Further, on the important people front, we made significant progress on our talent investment by hiring in priority areas like construction, and surety. Colleagues are choosing Aon because they see the power of our capability and connected firm enabled by ABS to win new clients and better serve existing clients. Finally, to connect all the dots with one specific client example, we expanded our relationship with a major risk capital client facing soaring health care costs due to high-cost climates. We won their human capital mandate using our health risk analyzer, to provide insights and predictive analytics on the client's future claims. Helping them manage both their risk and benefits budget. And this example highlights the strength of our three by three plan to drive financial results. As we look ahead, while it's clear we're operating in a complex economic environment, we remain confident in the resilience and strength of our business and financial model. We have a track record of sustained performance across bull markets, recessions, economic shocks, and changing political landscapes, and in fact, our integrated solutions and United strategy bring differentiated and substantial client benefit in periods of greatest uncertainty. We view the current environment as an opportunity to further strengthen our client relationships and reinforce Aon as a trusted adviser. In our daily interactions with clients, we have not seen a pullback in demand, rather we see an increase in clients looking for guidance and offerings. To navigate the increasing complexity of their business challenges. And as a result, we are reaffirming our 2025 full-year guidance. Including mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin expansion, strong earnings growth, and double-digit free cash flow growth. To summarize, I want to reiterate our conviction about the opportunity ahead. That Aon's advice and solutions are even more valuable to clients as they navigate increased complexity in their businesses. We continue to see momentum across our business. From the high-quality talent, we're attracting to Aon to the progress we're making to attack the $31 billion middle market opportunity to major wins. With both new and existing clients. And we remain on track to deliver against our 2025 financial goals. Of course, none of this would be possible without our global team. We want to thank our 60,000 colleagues around the world for their commitment to excellence and innovation and extraordinary leadership and hard work, is what enables us to deliver for our clients. And finally, and to focus further on our long-term strategy and opportunity, we hope you can join us for our investor day on June ninth. Edmund and I and the senior executives leading our three by three plan look forward to sharing details about Aon United as a powerful asset. And how we'll continue to drive sustainable long-term growth and create value for our shareholders. It promises to be a very productive event. Now I'll turn the call to Edmund for a more detailed review of our financials and outlook. Edmund?
Edmund Reese: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here discussing the results for the first quarter of 2025. Before jumping into the details, it's important to filter the quarterly noise both within our first quarter results and within the uncertainty of the broader macroeconomic environment. And emphasize the signals from Q1 that reinforce our confidence in the fundamentals of our business and financial model. Supporting our full-year 2025 guidance and ongoing long-term growth. First, our Q1 performance underscores our commitment to making the investments that support sustainable mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth. Investing in hiring client-facing talent, strengthening and accelerating our ABS capabilities, and increasing our Aon client leaders to expand with our existing clients. Organic revenue growth reached 5% for the quarter, with retention tracking one point better than Q1 2024 and market impact from pricing and exposures reflecting some pressure but slightly better than our expectations and still within our estimated range. Second, relentless execution on our accelerating Aon United program. Notably in ABS, is creating 85 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Creating capacity to fund the investments that I just referenced, and strengthening the foundation for ongoing operating leverage from scale benefits. Third, we continued our balanced capital allocation discipline. Remaining on track to meet our leverage objective and while simultaneously continuing our middle market tuck-in acquisition to drive growth. And returning $397 million in capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. Additionally, our continued focus on portfolio management positions us to further strengthen our capital position double down on growth in our core business, and sustain healthy capital returns to shareholders. So the drivers of full-year 2025 growth investing for sustainable organic revenue growth, continued margin expansion, and our strong capital position remains stable. And we are executing our plan. Despite the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and the noise in the first quarter, specifically from FX, given the dollar's 3% to 7% stronger than it was in Q1 2024. Where we have currency exposure. Three months of additional impact on margin from NFP, higher interest in shares driven by the acquisition, of NFP, all items that we communicated as part of our 2025 guidance. We have a high level of confidence in delivering on our financial objectives and achieving full-year results in line with our 2025 guidance. So now turning to the first quarter results and the financial summary on slide six. You see that total revenue increased 16% to $4.7 billion. And we delivered 5% organic revenue growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income margin was 38.4%. Down 130 basis points as we recognized the impact of NFP in the Q1 2025 results. Adjusted EPS was $5.67 reflecting the impact of higher interest in shares. And finally, we generated $84 million in free cash flow. So let's get into the details of these results starting with organic revenue growth on slide eight. Organic revenue growth reached 5% in Q1 2025, continuing to be in line with our mid-single-digit or greater guidance range. In commercial risk, organic revenue growth was 5%. But the biggest contribution coming from our international P&C business. Additionally, the growth reflected continued strength in our North American core P&C business. And while deal activity was slower than expected when entering the year, we had a modest tailwind from M&A services relative to Q1 2024. Reinsurance with 4% organic revenue growth was driven by growth in treaty placements, and double-digit growth in both facultative placements and insurance-linked securities. This growth was partially offset by the impact of a multiyear extension with a significant client at higher limits and adjusted commission. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect softer market conditions with April 1 property rates in both the US and Japan down 5% to 20%. Importantly, we expect full-year organic revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit or greater objective as we see a strong second half driven by higher limits at July 1 renewals, continued growth in our international faculty replacements, and strength in our strategy and technology group. Health solutions also delivered 5% growth. Driven by a double-digit increase in our core health and benefits business which was particularly strong in our international markets. The growth was fueled by net new business and market conditions that continue to stimulate rising health care costs. In talent, we saw high single-digit growth in our advisory business, offset by lower data analytics sales which were impacted by our data delivery schedule. We still expect our talent business to deliver mid-single-digit or greater full-year growth. And finally, wealth was our highest growing solution line in the quarter. Generating 8% organic revenue growth primarily driven by NFP asset inflows and market performance, and continued regulatory work across the UK EMEA. I will note that in the second quarter, we will be growing over an elevated Q2 2024. Our Q1 organic revenue growth continued to be powered by new business, which contributed nine points from both existing and new clients. Retention was one point better than a year ago. With commercial risk steadily improving as we deploy our risk capital analyzers supporting a net new business contribution of four points to organic revenue growth. The net market impact, which measures the impact of exposures and rate contributed one point to organic revenue growth squarely within our zero to two-point estimated range. Reinsurance was flat as rate declines were mitigated with increased sideways coverage. And rate pressure and commercial risk was offset with limit and coverage increases across our book. Wealth had positive net market impact as we continue to see increasing cost and health, and positive market impact in wealth. And one final point on revenue. First-quarter fiduciary investment income was down 15% versus last year to $67 million as the increase in average balances was more than offset by lower interest rates. As a reminder, we'd not include fiduciary investment income in our organic revenue growth calculation. On slide nine, adjusted operating income was up 12% for the quarter to $1.8 billion. Adjusted operating margin was 38.4% in the first quarter, in line with expectations and down from 39.7% in Q1 2024. Reflecting the impact of the NFP acquisition. Which closed in late April 2024. As well as the interest rate impact on investment income from fiduciary balances. Adjusted operating margin continued to benefit from the scale in our business. Particularly through Aon Business Services and from our restructuring initiative to accelerate our three by three plan. Specifically, restructuring savings in the first quarter were $40 million which contributed approximately 85 basis points to adjusted operating margin. Looking ahead, we continue to expect $150 million of savings for the full year 2025, and are well on track to achieve our stated goal of $350 million of run rate savings in 2026. Our organic revenue growth and the actions we are taking through Aon Business Services to standardize our operations and integrate our platforms are creating capacity to fund our growth investments and setting the foundation for ongoing margin expansion through operating efficiencies and scale in our business. We remain committed to driving full-year adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 to 90 basis points in 2025. Moving to interest, other income, and taxes on slide ten. Interest income of $5 million was $23 million lower than last year when we earned interest on funds utilized in the NFP acquisition. We expect interest income to be negligible in Q2 2025 compared to the $31 million Q2 2024. Interest expense of $206 million was up $62 million versus last year, reflecting $7 billion in higher debt driven by the NFP acquisition. We expect $209 million of interest expense in Q2 2025. Other expense increased $23 million year over year, primarily due to higher noncash pension expense. And finally, the Q1 tax rate was 20.9%. 160 basis points lower than Q1 2024, reflecting the geographic mix of income growth and the favorable impact of discrete items. Our tax guidance for the full year remains at 19.5% to 20.5%. Turning now to free cash flow. And capital allocation on slide eleven. We generated $84 million of free cash flow in Q1 reflecting strong operating income growth and DSO improvements, partially offset by higher incentive, interest, and restructuring payments. We continue to expect double-digit free cash flow growth in 2025 and a double-digit three-year CAGR on free cash flow from 2023 to 2026. In the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.5 times and we continue to be on track to achieve a 2.8 to 3 times leverage ratio in Q4 2025. Consistent with the objective that we set when we announced the NFP acquisition. Additionally, we remained active in M&A continuing our targeted tuck-in acquisitions across priority areas including middle market acquisitions through NFP. Which acquired $19 million in EBITDA in Q1. The pipeline remains strong, especially with opportunities and commercial risk. And we continue to expect to acquire $45 to $60 million of EBITDA NFP middle market acquisitions in 2025. Finally, we returned $397 million in capital to shareholders due to dividend and $250 million in share repurchases in Q1. Additionally, and as Greg mentioned, in April, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.74 per share. Marking fifteen consecutive annual dividend increases. Reflecting the strength of our business and financial model, and our confidence in achieving double-digit free cash flow growth. I will conclude my prepared remarks on slide twelve, with our 2025 guidance and some final thoughts. The first quarter 2025 performance signals a start to the year that is right in line with our expectations. We are executing our three by three plan, and have momentum that is being reflected in our first quarter results. Removing the noise and elevating what matters for our full-year 2025 guidance. Let me highlight the following. We achieved 5% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, leading our objective. So we are reaffirming our mid-single-digit or greater 2025 full-year guidance for organic revenue growth.
Operator: We continue to get scale benefits through ABS.
Edmund Reese: We are achieving our restructuring goals, and we continue to actively manage the portfolio. So we are still expecting and reaffirming 80 to 90 basis points of margin expansion for the full year 2025. We also continue to expect strong earnings growth for the full year and I will note that we are excited that today marks the one-year anniversary of the NFP acquisition. And as a reminder, the late April 2024 close will impact Q2 2025 margin and earnings just as we expected. For modeling purposes, we are estimating 15% to 18% adjusted EPS growth in Q2 2025. And finally, our earnings growth, including NFP's, will contribute to double-digit free cash flow growth in 2025, and a double-digit three-year CAGR for 2023 to 2026. Our guidance demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business and financial model. We are prioritizing investments that support sustainable organic revenue growth, our execution in Aon business service is supporting top-line growth, creating investment capacity, delivering margin expansion. We expect to deliver strong earnings per share growth and to generate double-digit free cash flow growth. And we continue to have disciplined capital allocation balancing between high return growth investment and capital return to shareholders. Finally, as Greg mentioned, my 60,000 plus colleagues and I are excited to host an investor day on June ninth. Our first in twenty years and I look forward to your participation. So with that, Rob, we'll hand it back to you, and we'll jump into questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question at this time, you may press star one from your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. May press star two if you'd like to withdraw your question from the queue.
Greg Case: For participants in the media and speaker equipment,
Operator: may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment please while we poll for questions and that's star one. Thank you.
Greg Case: Thank you. And our first question today is from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Securities.
Operator: Please proceed with your questions. Hey, good morning.
Andrew Kligerman: So you know, you just Edmund just mentioned the one-year anniversary of having acquired NFP. Sounds like things are going really well there. Now that you've got this year under your belt,
Operator: how are you feeling? Could you give us a little color on the M&A pipeline? I know in the slides, it mentions that it's robust. I mean, any statistics? Could you do a big acquisition? If you feel that there's the right one out there? I mean,
Edmund Reese: how are you thinking about M&A for NFP as we move into
Greg Case: through 2025? Andrew, thanks for the question. And listen, I'm really looking forward to this one. There's a step back, the overall capital allocation piece, and Edwin can comment on this as well, is really what drives what we do, drives everything capital allocation. We're always looking for opportunities to strengthen the firm. And reinforce what we do from a return on invested capital standpoint. And the good news is, I tell you, it's been a great year with NFP. It's been terrific to have them as part of the overall Aon family. A lot of good things happening in the middle market with lots of opportunities there as you're indicating. And we're certainly looking at that. And we're certainly gonna continue to execute on the programmatic work that we've been doing from an acquisition standpoint just a superb a superb engine in place at NFP. There's a broad set of opportunities we'll continue to look at. You know, you'll note we're making substantial organic investment in the firm. We're making investment, you know, in the on the M&A front as well as other areas as well. So look for us to continue to do that and suffice to say we see lots of opportunities and we'll always continue to evaluate those in the context of everything that's going on around capital allocation. Including the debt pay down. But, Evan, what else would you Yeah.
Edmund Reese: Yeah. Greg's exactly right. There's tons of opportunity on the M&A front, but your question is about 2025. And in 2025, as part of our disciplined capital allocation, you know, the prime objective for us, the number one objective, is to get back to our leverage ratio target. And I think we're well on track to do that in Q1 I'm sorry, in Q4 2025. That's the first step. We're very excited, the fact of just increasing the dividend in the remaining capacity is what we'll look to analyze the opportunities that Greg's talking about to ensure that they fit within, you know, our overall strategy, our three by three plan, and have the right financial return criteria. Before we deploy capital to M&A. And, of course, we're gonna continue to balance capital return to shareholders. So in 2025, the key point is I think we have the right free cash flow generation to get to the right place from a leverage ratio standpoint. We have the free cash flow that allows us to continue to get $45 to $60 million in M&A in the middle market space through NFP and the rest. This year, we take a focus on capital return to shareholders. Got it. Thanks. And
Andrew Kligerman: and then with respect to commercial risk solutions, you know, really solid 5% plus organic revenue growth I think you mentioned that the market impact was flat in the release. Could you give a little color around the backdrop of how pricing influenced the 5% plus, how exposures influenced the 5% plus. It seemed, you know, one of your competitors reported a decent in that area. In organic growth and investors felt a little concerned. So I'd like to get a little sense of you know, what these different market impacts are more granularly and then, you know, why you feel so confident that you could continue to do And I know it's for the whole organization, but more focused on CRS why you think you can do 5% or mid-single or better? Andrew, excellent question and a lot to unpack there because you really talked about
Greg Case: commercial risk overall for Aon. Within the context of that what's going on commercial risk pricing. So maybe we'll take an first start governing your thought with Aon and maybe go to pricing, and if you're okay with that. Sure. We'll get Edmund to chime in here as well. First you're absolutely right. We as we reflect on the first quarter, we very pleased with the progress. And the you know, what's under the hood for us is really what's most prevalent. And it's another quarter as you described of organic revenue at 5%. It really does reflect the new business and strong retention. That's really the drivers of it. And with mentions of a market impact was limited, but, you know, but it held steady with our expectations. This was growth for us, by the way, across all major geographies. Strength in corp P&C and especially in international, fantastic. But more than anything, Andrew, it really is we're seeing traction on what we're doing with the three by three plan. And this is risk capital, you know, really delivered through Aon client leadership and powered by Aon business services. And these are our risk analyzers. They're opening doors, broadening discussions, They're frankly increasing win rates for us in RFPs. Same on retention. I've been talking about a point increase in retention. This is driven by, you know, service enhancements that are substantial like the certificate plus platform that we've talked about before. And then the impact of hiring, which is just beginning to really have effect in terms of where we are. We continue to invest and drive that. So for us, we feel very good about the overall program and progress. And what Q1 did for us in commercial risk and really did across the board is just highlight progress and reinforce our conviction around mid-single-digit or greater for the year. So that's the overall business. And maybe I may comment on that a bit, then I'm we'll turn back to Andrew's key point on pricing.
Edmund Reese: Yeah. Sure. I mean, Greg, I think you hit all the points on the commercial risk When we it won't even when we go back to the key points on pricing, I think the answer is very much similar in that the growth here is driven primarily by new business. That was ten points in the quarter when we think about commercial risk and the retention, I talked about that being better sequentially and year over year. Better than last quarter and better than the year before. And a lot of that is driven by the investments in the deployment of our analyzers, as Greg just said, hoping in RFPs, that's driven by our EC our enterprise client group going on an expanding with our relationships. And despite the pressure in clients on certain lines. The outlook in the second half is that we continue to have strength in commercial risk, particularly as we think about the hires that we've been doing, priority areas like construction, which we think will pick up in the second half and the actions we're taking to drive the limit and coverage increases to offset any modest pricing impact. So we're gonna continue to focus on that net new business and the retention component of it.
Greg Case: And then so, Anders, that answer your question on the Aon front? Then I wanna come to pricing specifically because I don't wanna I don't understand.
Andrew Kligerman: That was perfect.
Greg Case: Okay. Alright. Let's go to pricing for a minute. And just we just wanna offer a couple of things here. First, because it's been it's part of all the conversations it seems of late. And look, typically, Andrew, everybody's on unit pricing. That's the sole topic. You know, we'll continue to remind everyone it's unit price and insured values. This is sort of the market impact. That's what Edwin was describing before. We came into the quarter kind of zero to two. Expectations were at one. Though I do want to highlight irrespective of what's going currently, the long-term trends here long-term trends, this is critical, are increasing in terms of levels of risk. So this is cyber, supply chain, weather, social inflation. So at a macro level, the need is increasing. So that has implications implications on sort of overall demand and pricing. Having said that, we also wanna be explicit. You know, it's been described by my colleagues as kind of the current market really reflects the current trading environment, and that's generally we're buyer friendly. And so generally, because there is no really macro market here, it's a bunch of micro markets, property rates, you know, are softening a bit. Particularly in large property in the US and a little bit more in Asia Pacific as well. And that's really, by the way, not surprising. That's where the big increases were. A bit softer on the financial line side and cyber as well, you know, overall. The exception, by the way, Andrew, on the other side is, you know, things like US auto and excess excess casualty, which, again, lots of different reasons why that's going up and increasing. And then we would say middle market, you know, similar conditions on the stresses. Absolutely. Maybe it's slightly more muted because the segment doesn't have the same peaks and valleys as some of the large market pieces, but certainly the same pressures. But we also as we always do, we're working with clients to understand the conditions and improve their program. Change limits, buy coverages they lost in the hard market, reduce it, you know, all those things you can imagine. Andrew, were working on. And then one of the things that was interesting is alternative risk transfer continues to be highly prevalent. And the work we're doing with reinsurance in the commercial risk arena on alternative risk transfer is substantial. But net net, it relates to Aon, I just wanna finish with Edmunds point. You know, for us, it's about client wins and retention, and that's except exceptionally strong, and the three by three plan has really supported us, which is why in this environment, we're, you know, we're reinforcing our conviction around mid-single-digit or greater. But that's a little more color on the pricing side.
Operator: Great to hear. Very helpful. Next question is from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question
Elyse Greenspan: is on reinsurance. I know, Edmund, you mentioned a multiyear extension that I think had a negative impact in the quarter. I was hoping to get more details and quantification there. Then I think you pointed to some softer conditions in the second quarter. So I guess is the expectation Q2 could be similar to Q1. And then things pick up in the back half. I was hoping to kind of flush those both of those things out relative to reinsurance.
Greg Case: Well, maybe, at least if you don't mind, there's a little macro point on kind of the overall reinsurance and what the first quarter told us. Because one of the themes that sort of Edmund started with is really understanding kind of the underlying kind of performance factors that we saw in Q1. There's obviously a lot of noise for us as we as we closed NFP and then all the pieces around that. But reinsurance is no different than commercial risk. Exceptionally positive in terms of what we saw and what indicated for the rest of the year, which is why, again, we are at that same expectation, mid-single-digit or greater. And net net, think about what's going on in reinsurance right now for us. We're building on core momentum, and really this is you know, what we do at a segment level with our clients. But really differentiating on analytics. And what we've invested in in business services and with risk capital has been really for us meaningful. You know, real tour de force. We're winning more than ever before in this context on the reinsurance and the commercial risk side. And this risk capital construct is also meaningful. You know, the level of cap bonds and parametric work we're doing is exceptional and driven by risk capital. And the strategic and technology group, Edmund mentioned, also reinforcing and driving progression. And so, you know, the 4%, which, you know, seven in the first quarter of last year, it's three replacements as Edmund described. It's double-digit growth in facultated. It's you know, another double-digit growth on insurance like securities. So in net net, strong progression overall. And then you know, I'll just highlight, and then mentioned the piece, you know, around the multiyear extension. This was a phenomenal outcome for this client. This was a massive let me just say, massive program and what we did is what we always do. We talk about value creation and what we're trying to do on their behalf and then we we get paid on value. By the way, you know, it affects timing sometimes. And in this case, in Q1, it affected timing. But overall, the impact for this client was huge. The impact for Aon is huge. We're excited about this progression. But it showed up in Q1. But it you shouldn't confuse the Q1 impact with the overall year opportunity and sort of what it's gonna look like over time, and that gets us back to mid-single-digit or greater. So anyway, that's a bit of a background. But anything else you'd add? And make sure you're just because the last point that you made. We obviously don't have the
Edmund Reese: continued impact client impact, which is an extremely positive thing for us, exactly what we wanna do. Extend and expand with our clients. So, Elise, I wanna be clear in your question that you shouldn't expect that impact, obviously, to carry over into Q2. Into Q2. And while we do have line of sight into just as you were others talk about the US and Japan April one renewals, I think the strong performance that we had Q1 x that extension you should see flow over into Q2. And then when we go out in the second half of the year, this is a business where we do have line of sight. We can see sort of, like, where we're tracking. And when I look at the second half of the year, the July one renewals, we have good line of sight too. And that looks strong. Increased limit. We also see the continued growth in our international fact facultative placement one of the things that was very strong in Q1 as well and the STG group. So I think Q2 through Q4 should be in line with our mid-single digits guidance and the overall year in line with that. As well.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my follow-up question I just wanted to well, a, confirm, right, that it's double-digit growth rate on I think it's on the reported $2.8 billion from 2024. So I guess the, you know, NFP contribution will help Aon get to the double digits. I just wanna make sure that I'm thinking about the free cash flow growth off of the right base and what the message is. Is there any seasonality to the back three quarters that we need to think about in terms of, you know, hitting that double-digit target for the full year?
Edmund Reese: But the short answer is yes. You hit it exactly exactly right. That we are talking about the baseline of 2024 double-digit growth. I think you'll see growth, that double-digit growth, a contribution from NFP, but also our core operating performance in the continued improvement that we have on DSO. There's two things in Q1. You asked a question about seasonality, so there are two things I'll point out to you in Q1 that's going on. We still have the integration cost from NFP. We have restructuring payments. I called that out related to our AAU program. And we have higher incentives. We've been hiring more. We had strong performance in Q2 2024, and it's typically our lowest quarter of free cash flow in Q1. That's what I would call out from seasonality, but as we go into the back half of the year, you have two things correct. You have the right denominator, the right starting baseline. You have the NFP contribution, but I'd also add the contribution from the core, the core performance of the business, both on the working capital side and the operating income side.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of David Modeemaiden with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.
David Motemaden: Hey, good morning.
Greg Case: I believe, I think it was admin you'd spoken about
David Motemaden: some of the hires and I know you guys added I think it was 4% new hires in certain revenue-producing roles last year. And it sounded like we haven't really gotten the contribution from those new hires in the first quarter here. It doesn't sound like it's really gonna come next quarter, but you're really pointing to the second half. So I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on some of headcount growth and the productivity enhancement as we think about the cadence of the organic growth within commercial risk. Yeah. It's a look, first the first point I'd make is that we're a growth company, and so we're committed to making the investments in the headcount. We did talk about that growth number last year in 2024, and frankly, we wanna do better than that. As we come into 2025, and we're off to a great start. In the right areas, in areas like health, construction, those places coming into 2025. I think it's still the short answer to your question is still too early to see the exact impact. And let me maybe be a little bit more specific with that. When we look at the Q1 vintages from 2024, we're now in months twelve to fifteen for those vintages. Still early. I talked about starting to see the impact on contribution to growth between months eighteen to twenty-four and beyond as we look at it. But the early signs suggest the average revenue for these early vintages are coming in at a profitable high return, and I expect that they'll soon be a contribution to the organic revenue growth. We did point out in Q4, we saw growth in some of those priority areas. That were that was quite strong in construction and energy. So all the signs are suggesting that we continue to lean into the investment for priority hires in these areas as we move forward. And we'll share information as we see as we see the metrics evolve.
Greg Case: And two things I just added that, David, if I could, is two messages embedded in in Edmund's comments. One is this is a continuing process. Around priority areas. And those will evolve over time, but we are gonna continue to drive in a continuous process. The second is you don't hear us backing up on margin as it relates to this. This is literally we're making these investments in the context of everything else we're doing. We're covering them with ABS capability and efficiency that comes with the positive pieces around revenue with ABS as well. And so for us, this is just part of an investment we are now prepared to make on an ongoing basis that strengthens our firm. And reinforces accretion on the top line, but also all also in performance and OI. And finally, the piece I just highlighted is we're not bringing these folks in as as a as account. You know, they're coming in to be better. When we actually identify capability and in priority areas, kind of how do we use our analyzers and our retention and all the pieces that come with this essentially not bigger not bigger, better. And, by the way, that's one of the reasons people are excited to be part of the firm when they see you know, the billion-dollar spend on AI business services and the analyzers and the and the service pieces, it's why we've been able to attract talent in some of these areas. It's important you understand the investment in the context of our overall strategy.
David Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just another question, more of a numbers question just on the margin. So I guess I'm just wondering, you know, noise with the NFP deal and sort of resetting the base. Could we get sort of the combined margin base for I guess, as we should think about it for the first quarter just given the time of 2024 and how much sort of core margin improvement or lack thereof there would have been this quarter. Sort of on a combined basis. I know, Edmund, you had called out the 85 basis points from cost saves, but was hoping to just get a little bit more color there we think about the ramp-up over the next several quarters. I wanna give you the short answer just so that we can clarify is not the lack thereof as you just mentioned there. Adjusting for the three months of NFP would have had us at over a hundred basis points of margin expansion in Q1. About that relative to ninety basis points in 2024. Think about that relative to the decade before 2024 being at a hundred and twenty-six basis points. So continued margin expansion is what you're seeing in our business. When you take a look at the impact of NFP there, The areas to focus on are exactly what we gave in the 2025 guidance. And I would say those areas, those four areas that I talked about are right in line with what we are expecting or slightly better. We talked about the NFP impact three additional months in Q1, four additional months for the year. Offset by the OpEx synergies, diluting margins by twenty basis points. There's no reason to think that we are not gonna do be at those levels or better. The second impact we talked about was the interest rate impact on fiduciary investment income. If you look at the rate, the average rate on fiduciary investment income, that was a hundred and ten basis points lower in the quarter. So that margin impact was right in line with the twenty basis points that we talked about there. I did point out in my prepared remarks the continued performance on the from AAU. So eighty-five basis points say that's exactly what we said in the guidance. And then I think just the operating leverage. Greg made an extremely important point, his second point in the last answer, about ABS creating capacity to fund investments. That's the operating leverage in our business. That's what I think is thirty-five to forty-five basis points. And that's why we're confident in reaffirming and maintaining the eighty to ninety basis points. So I think the way you think about it is that we are in fact expanding both in the core business and in NFP given the margin synergies.
Operator: Great. Thank you for that color.
David Motemaden: Thank you.
Operator: The next questions are from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.
Paul Newsome: Good morning. Just want to revisit a couple of the major topics here. The first one, and I apologize if I missed it, was the MFP was was it accretive to organic growth in the quarter? And I guess is sort of the better question, it have a bigger impact in the
Greg Case: retirement benefits businesses versus commercial. Because if I recall that its business was weighted more towards the health business than it was the PNC business. Paul, appreciate it. Thanks for the question. Listen, as we step back, it is just to reiterate, it's been an it's been an amazing year. NFP has brought such great capability and content. It's been great to watch NFP connect with Aon. Aon connects with NFP, and we've seen you know, meaningful opportunities in new client situations in existing client situations as, you know, NFPs utilize AI and client treaty and some of the capabilities we've got. But also as as as as Aon has benefited from the incredible client connections that NFP has as well. So this is a long-winded way of saying, listen, this is about AI. So in the end, yes, there was there was a was 5% organic contributions from NFP, fantastic. Contributions from Mayon, fantastic. But more important, Q1 for us was an indicator of what's to come. That's true on the three by three and the analyzers and the core business is also true on the NFP front. So it was really across the board, good contribution on the NFP front, good contribution on the overall Aon front. And really across the board, terms of business, it's commercial risk, wealth, and health all across the pieces. So we're not gonna be breaking out NFP as a construct because there's just too much connectivity that's happening. And the connectivity is not worth parsing. We essentially wanna reinforce connectivity as opposed to breakout separate pieces. And this is the beauty of independent and connected. Independent in the day to day in the field and what's happening in the pieces around that. Really connected from the standpoint of content and capability in ways that actually helps our producers do more with clients every day. So just suffice it to say, all contributed, all on track, and all, you know, we're very excited about the high expectations we had as we came into the year. Great. And then resisting pricing a little bit, one of the
Paul Newsome: questions in the quarter through the industry has been what appears to be differentiating behavior between larger account commercial and small and mid. And I'm just curious if you have any thoughts upon that, if that was indeed what you're seeing as well within your book. And if you think that that's a potential continuing trend the future. Yeah. We would say Paul, the point I was trying to make before
Greg Case: know, Andrew's question was really around look, you know, generally the trading conditions are softer in specific areas, property, you know, financial lines, cyber. With some exceptions, as I said, on the auto side and the casualty side, of course, on the OPs. We saw similar trends similar trends in mid-market slightly more muted. Although, you know, they're moments, but slightly more muted just given that there was not as much peaks and valleys overall. I would bring you back though to the macro points around the long-term trends. All the things that are happening you know, cyber supply chain, you know, climate weather, social inflation, these affect the middle market too. Our middle market clients is we're finding with NFP very sophisticated set of needs. And when you can bring real solutions to them, they matter and they matter, you know, even more in the current environment. So, you know, I think directionally, you probably have a we would agree. But, you know, the nuance matters because it shows up one client at a time. And, you know, and it's why we've been, you know, we have success because we can bring solutions in a very specific tailored way on a client-by-client basis. But generally, I'd say you're directionally right.
Paul Newsome: Alright. Thank you for the thoughtful answers and always appreciate the help.
Operator: Our next questions are coming from the line of Meyer Shields. KBW. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thanks so much. I appreciate the outlook in terms of tougher comp for wealth solutions in the second quarter and I guess the back half of the year. Something you could add a little color in terms of the specific businesses and underlying factors that were so strong in the first quarter of this year.
Meyer Shields: Like, what is it that actually drove the investments growth?
Greg Case: Well, listen, maybe if you come back Meyer, we've loved our it's been fantastic teams been able to do it over a really a multiyear period. Again, I would come back on the wealth side start with macro trends, then talk about the Aon team and what the drivers of success are. Know, and remember, by the way, this business overall is kinda two-thirds retirement, one-third in investments. The investments business has a core investments piece, but it also has an advisory piece embedded in it as well. So that's kind of the macro business. But think about the macro trends. It's retirement readiness. You know, 20% of the world's ready for retirement. That's a you know, that is a massive, you know, it's a massive challenge for the world as this evolves. If we can address retirement readiness, huge. Second wealth transfer, you think about sort of what's going on. Also very, very substantial. And then the piece you can't lose is the regulatory change challenges that so seem to come up, you know, year after year after year. And so from our standpoint, we've got an amazing team across each one of those pieces. Now even stronger, you know, on the NFP front. And the team's exceptional. And the drivers of success for us has been much like it was on the commercial side, new business and retention. New business and retention. It really is client leadership. And we you know, new capabilities, new clients and then retaining them longer. The second big piece is pension risk transfer. So you've seen us do some things in that arena that, you know, really no one else has been able to do in the US and the European in the UK theater in particular. And then finally on the core retirement side, which everyone, you know, comes back and says this is the challenge on defined benefit to defined contribution, and it is in the form of time. But my gosh, in its current world with the regulatory challenges, it really creates opportunity for us to help clients think about that overall strategy. So those are the very specific things that are really driving success on the well side. And Ed had been quite right when we talked about some of that, you know, some of the pressures in you know, in Q2 as so to be mindful of those. But the team's done a phenomenal job, you know, progressing here. And we're looking forward to, you know, continued success.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. If I can switch gears, you talked about the individual, I guess, multiyear extension within reinsurance.
Edmund Reese: And, Greg, you described that as a really good deal for the client, which is what you should be doing. Does that mean that we should expect other such deals, not necessarily with this client, but others?
Greg Case: Listen. We've come back, Myer, is philosophically this is by the way, I just answered specific. This is a very unique situation. Let me just stress very unique. And very substantial in terms of both the size and the value creation that we brought forward. So for us, we're always looking for innovative ways to think about how to bring value to clients. And, you know, if you think about, you know, Aon's history, we will never be low price. We're not gonna be low price. We're gonna be high value. We cost a dollar and we can prove to a client we give them back two dollars and we can quantify that. They actually understand it. They can touch it. They can feel it. They know it either affects volatility, which is value creation or actual cost, etcetera. Myra, that's how we go. By the way, if our competitor comes in and says they're fifty cents, but it can only, you know, return fifty-two cents if a client believes that and understands that they go with us. If they don't believe it, they don't. Our analytics make us stronger and stronger in that regard. In this case, very unique. Let me just add very unique and very substantial. You know, we want some kind of the, you know, the more annual periodic piece to a very long-term engagement that enables us to do some things on their behalf that is, you know, they're exceptional. And so it was really in that context we did what we would call great value creation and we got recognized for that value. So I think this was for us. Great outcomes on both sides and we'd love to do more of these in a way that really can have kind of value, but this is a very as I said last time, very unique situation. The downside is it adds some pressure in timing, and you saw that in the first quarter, but so be it. You know, we wanna do a try it on public client. Greg, it had pressure in reinsurance
Edmund Reese: in the quarter. We have a diversified business across multiple solution lines, commercial, reinsurance, health, and wealth. And the reason that we're still able to deliver the mid-single-digit is because of that. We're operating across solution lines because we're operating in multiple countries because we have the operating leverage in our business. And so when the opportunity comes to grow with the client and significant way and still be able to deliver our results, of course, we're gonna jump on that.
Operator: Okay. Fantastic. That was very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jimmy Butler with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Jimmy Bhullar: Yeah. Good morning. So question for Greg. I know you
Greg Case: affirmed your guidance, but obviously there's been a lot of volatility in the macro and geopolitical environment. So just wondering where the if any, there are changes in your expectations for your various businesses versus early in 2025. I know there's a lot of optimism about capital markets activity picking up, That hasn't happened, and now inflation's higher. But just if you could touch on your major businesses and where maybe you're more optimistic where you're seeing some headwinds. Yeah. I appreciate that that, Jimmy, and I'll I'll start and Evan can add some color as well. Listen, The trauma is real. You're seeing it every day. I do I would remind, though, you step back. Remember, Jimmy, we've been talking for quite some time about increased volatility. And we talked in about, you know, we call it four mega trends trade technology, weather, and workforce. And remember all those, that was before the tariffs, and this has been substantial. They're all there. They all continue to drive volatility. And in many respects, create risk for clients, which means demand if we can help them understand that volatility and reduce something about it. Clearly, today, trades at the forefront. No doubt about that. Clients are sitting there essentially saying, look, we don't only have to understand what's going on. We gotta do something. About it. You know? If COVID taught us anything, inaction is not a productive option. You've gotta do something. You gotta have a plan. So we're engaging. It really is across every one of our business really on the risk capital side, commercial and reinsurance, On the human capital side, with our talent business, health, even retirement, and we're active with clients. And we're helping them trying to understand the complexity and then what they can do about it. So described the supply chain diagnostic car analyzers, Jimmy, in terms of how to help them understand what's going on. And we just did a we just did a massive, you know, the biggest parametric I think the biggest parametric on a severe conductive storm that's ever been done a big steel company. And it really was in the face of, you know, this new set of risks that are they're on the rise and how they can deal with that. And so for us, you know, we're tailoring solutions against this. Now there are no doubt there are puts and takes here, and there will be pressures on areas of discretionary expense. So we should recognize that that will come and that will be real. But it's also, you know, offset in many respects by what I'm just describing. Our ability to react to client demand. And so for us, we step back right now and look, the world's changed a lot and even in the last thirty days in terms of pressure. But we look at where the world is right now and, you know, and we will say, listen, we feel have conviction about mid-single-digit or greater growth. We're, you know, we are not changing guidance based on what we've seen in the first quarter. And some of the underlying factors that we really see on the positive side we talked about on the call around what's happening with our three by three plan. All those are good in that context. That's where we are. And we said, Jimmy, that's across the board. You know, that's reinsurance, that's commercial risk, that's what we're doing in health and that's what we're doing in wealth. So for us, we see opportunities everywhere. We see the challenges. They're real. But against that said, we also see mid-single-digit or greater, and that's where we're focused on. And that's the mission to achieve. And that's what, that's our guidance as of today. And that means if I deliver it sure. Go ahead.
Edmund Reese: Go ahead. I mean, I was just gonna give you some I agree with Greg's point about mid-single-digit or greater. When we think about confidence in the second half and go through our solution lines, Specifically, it will continue to come through the new business and the retention construction core PNC, the NF pipeline and synergies, those things are improving. As we look in the second half of the year, and we'll have meaningful contribution In reinsurance, I mentioned earlier that July one renewals with more limits Again, we have line of sight there at the international faculty that in the health solution line, we have the core benefits. Remember, we just said that was double-digit in three other out of our four regions and nine percent in the other. So we continue to expect benefit and growth there as well as now getting the benefit of the talent business as we recognize revenue in data and analytics. And on the world side, I think we have great line of sight for Q2 on the asset component that Greg was talking about. But that regulatory component, pension risk transfer, and the strong retention, those are the things that are driving growth in the second half of the year. And, of course, we'll see some benefit from the investment hires. When I think about that, and the absence of the headwinds that we had in Q1, it's really important you know, to think about thirteen points of EPS headwinds from the increase in interest and the increase in shares from the NFP acquisition. Those things won't be there as we go around in the year. And so that together is what gives us confidence in the second half of the year and why we're reaffirming the guidance here. Got it.
Jimmy Bhullar: And then just on the performance of the NFP business, if you could just comment on how it's tracked versus what you would have expected. Because if we look at the contribution to revenues from acquisitions and dispositions, Both in RIS and in health, it was lower this quarter than it's been the last few quarters, and NFP is obviously a big number there. But any comments on the performance of the acquired business?
Greg Case: Jimmy, I just start macro levels. As we said before, listen, we had high expectations, and they've been exceeded in terms of what we're trying to do. Underlying connectivity, the old thesis around independent and connected, exactly as we'd hoped. The retention on the producer side, phenomenal. Again, ultimately, this is all about how our clients facing individual see more opportunity as we brought the firms together, and that's where we continue to work. We have work to do. No doubt about it, but we've made great progress. And at an underlying level, as Edmund has highlighted throughout the call, we just reiterated as all this comes together, you know, we're gonna deliver. It's gonna be we're together more creative, from a revenue standpoint, accretive from an operating standpoint, and certainly accretive from a free cash flow standpoint. So for us, all those things come together and we feel fantastic about kind of the work in the first year. And this first anniversary and looking forward to, you know, continuing with this with this.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question today is from the line of Cave Montazeri with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.
Cave Montazeri: Thank you. First question is on the Investor Day. The first one in twenty years. I'm just wondering, is there something specific that you think the street is underappreciating maybe in terms, like, the power of the Aon United platform? Your ABS capabilities, or the three by three plan? Or is it a new approach to communication and maybe we should expect more regular investor days going forward. I don't know, KB. I mean, on more investor days,
Greg Case: days. You know, one every twenty years might be the right answer. We'll see. But listen, we're really excited about this. And I really I really hope I listening who have an interest can come. This for us is we think there's something here around next-generation client experience. We spent fifteen years working on a platform on a connected global firm. We made no apologies. When we connect to our global firm, we call it a Unite, but we're not kidding. We're talking about single brands, single opco, single p and l, done some things that have really been difficult strides to get us coordinated. When we coordinate well on behalf of clients, we win more, we do more with them, we keep them longer. What's happened though in the three by three plan is we saw an opportunity to massively accelerate that. And the acceleration gets born out in something we call a next-generation client experience. Full stop. And risk capital and human capital are a organization to sort of think about innovation at a client level, and we've seen many examples of that. But that wasn't enough. We needed a way to deliver it at a client level that's Aon client leadership, and that wasn't enough. We needed Aon business services. We needed the power of a way to look across data embed the work we've done on AI and now generative AI, which we have done. And we think we've come to a place, KB, in which this next-generation client experience is real and powerful. And we didn't wanna do it at the beginning of the three by three, so we had a year go by. We're essentially gonna update you on that next-generation client experience and where we are. The specific tangible places where we think it's changing the way clients actually do what they do and help make some better. And so for us, we don't I've probably tell in my voice we're pretty excited about this step change. It builds on the Aon United thesis around a connected global firm but a massive acceleration. It's why we bet the billion dollars. It's why we put a billion dollars at work to reinforce Aon Business Services, to innovate around risk capital, human capital, and deliver it through Aon client leadership. So you're gonna see that mechanics. We're gonna provide as much detail as we can. Probably have a few clients there talking about how it's different and how it's, you know, potentially useful for them as they think about running there and driving their businesses. And we hope you enjoy it. And then we'll see what happens. You'll maybe you can give us your thought on sort of how frequently we might do that. But in the meantime, we're excited about June ninth and hope you can join us.
Operator: Again, I'm looking forward looking forward to it. My follow-up question
Cave Montazeri: should be an easy one. The, Edmund, the second quarter EPS guidance that you gave us, 15% to 18% EPS growth. Is that is the baseline the $2.93 reported or is there any adjustments we need to make? To the starting point?
Edmund Reese: That is the baseline. That's exactly right. And look, we were an angel company. We're gonna continue to focus on full-year guidance because we think the long-term drivers of growth are all stable. I gave that Q2 guidance because we do have the unique situation I recognize and appreciate from a modeling standpoint given the timing of the NFP close. And so you do have the right baseline. And hopefully, the Q2 is helpful.
Cave Montazeri: Appreciate this. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: Wanted to say we appreciate everyone joining us and look forward to June ninth and our next discussion. Thanks so much.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-31 02:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter 2024 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year conference call. I'm joined by Edmund Reese, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website, which Edmund will reference in his remarks. We want to begin by sending our deepest sympathy to our colleagues, clients and all those impacted by recent disasters and in particular, the devastating wildfires in Southern California. The destruction and loss of life are tragic events, and all of us at Aon are committed to supporting our clients, colleagues and partners during the response and recovery. Now turning to Aon. We're excited to be here this morning to discuss our strong performance in 2024. We had great execution in year one of our 3x3 Plan with all credit to our colleagues around the globe, which I will cover in more detail at the close of my comments. That execution is translating into winning more clients, expanding our relationships and keeping clients longer through improved retention. And it shows in our financial results. For the full year 2024, we grew organic revenue 6%, total revenue 17%. We delivered strong margins and grew our operating income by 17%, driving 10% adjusted earnings per share growth and continued strong free cash flow. These results are a strong start to our 3x3 Plan. And as we go into 2025, year 2, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, continued margin expansion in line with our historic performance, strong adjusted EPS growth, double-digit free cash flow growth and disciplined capital allocation. As we move forward, it's important to understand the environment in which our clients are operating and the external factors shaping client demand. Every day, our clients tells us that increasing volatility and complexity make decisions regarding risk and people issues more difficult. The challenges businesses face reflect a series of profound transitions across the mega trends of trade, technology, weather and workforce, which we saw reinforced by events throughout 2024 and which are firmly in place as we move into 2025. These four mega trends are causing significant challenges across every sector and every type of business. At the same time, leaders worried that their organizations aren't moving quickly enough to address these risks. Our 3x3 Plan is anchored in meeting these intensifying client requirements, better serving our clients with the unique content, servicing capability and expertise needed to respond to these challenges. In this environment, for Aon, 2024 was a year of tremendous progress across all three pillars of our 3x3 Plan: Risk Capital and Human Capital, Aon client leadership and Aon Business Services, three commitments we're delivering over a three year period. First, we committed to leveraging our distinctive Risk Capital and Human Capital structure to unlock new solutions that address the evolving client demand discussed earlier. In 2024, we created and delivered innovative solutions that integrate reinsurance and commercial risk data and analytics. Solutions using this connected capability are enabling clients to access capital more efficiently and make better decisions. Our work in the fourth quarter to help source $715 million of alternative reinsurance capacity for a major underwriter, and the record 30% increase in Aon Client Treaty capacity are just two examples of the power of Risk Capital. Similarly, in Human Capital, a global company with over 100,000 employees in more than 100 countries awarded us the mandate for their global benefits program. Our global team brought together regional data and insights from analytic tools to deliver a comprehensive, globally consistent and compliant benefits offering. What was originally just a small Aon relationship in one jurisdiction is now an international relationship across every region they operate to support their colleagues in enterprise strategy. And this is just one example that demonstrates the unique value of our globally connected firm and differentiated data-driven advice and solutions. For Risk Capital, we also want to note and officially welcome John Neal to Aon. We announced earlier this month that John will join us from Lloyd's as our Global CEO of Reinsurance and Global Chairman of Climate Solutions upon the completion of his commitments to Lloyd's. Not only will John's arrival bring an iconic industry leader to help focus on delivering our integrated Risk Capital capabilities to clients, but his addition also represents another strong testament to the power of our Risk Capital and Human Capital strategy. Our second commitment is to embed the Aon client leadership model across our enterprise client, large and middle market segments to strengthen and expand client relationships. In 2024, we capitalized on our globally connected approach covering nearly 1,000 of our most critically important global clients within our Enterprise Client Group. These clients grew new business 5 points above the Aon average in 2024 as we increase penetration across solution lines and geographies. Third, we committed to and are accelerating Aon Business Services to establish a new standard for service delivery and innovation at scale. And we made progress and great strides in 2024, giving clients real-time insights to help them make better decisions. From advanced analytics to customized dashboards, the tools that we launched this year are redefining client experiences and outcomes. In May, we debuted a new suite of risk analyzer tools, enabling our North American clients to receive exposure data, quantify loss potential and make better decisions based on total cost of risk. And we've seen great early traction with our analyzers, which continue to open doors, broad discussions with our clients and increase win rates. Let me highlight just a few of many examples. Early in 2024, we released our Property Risk Analyzer. Through exposure profiles and data models, the tool stimulates the impact of insurance policy options to determine which risk should be retained versus transferred. In the fourth quarter, we launched the Cyber Risk Analyzer, enabling risk managers and brokers to better evaluate cyber risk and maximize insurance value. We also launched our Health Risk Analyzer, a solution that leverages predictive modeling, risk optimization and ongoing monitoring to help clients identify and manage costs and plan for a predictable risk accordingly. At the same time, ABS retired nearly 300 applications and continues to drive greater efficiencies, which are foundational to our sustained margin expansion, which Edmund will describe. The result of meeting these milestones in 2024 is the delivery of highly distinctive capabilities and expertise that has created sustainable momentum for Aon. We also want to highlight the progress we're making with NFP. Eight months in, the business is performing very well, just as expected. Integration is right on track. Producer retention is strong, and the acquisition is driving top line growth as we build on NFP's strong client relationships by bringing additional content capabilities and tools to the team. Clients have responded well to the potential for NFP under the Aon umbrella, giving us even more confidence in our ability to achieve our sales and cost synergy goals in 2025 and 2026. And against this operating backdrop, Aon closed the year with a strong fourth quarter that drove another year of financial performance aligned with our objectives. As we begin year 2 of the 3x3 Plan, we entered 2025 with momentum and have a strong foundation to build upon. The progress achieved in 2024 demonstrated the potential of our strategy, and now we will advance each component to drive further success. Looking ahead, as we onboard recent hires, we're continuing to invest to support top line growth, particularly client-facing talent in prioritized growth areas and an innovative new technology-driven solutions enabled through Aon Business Services. In addition, the efficiencies we gained through Aon Business Services continue to support margin expansion. As a result, we expect to deliver another year of mid-single-digit or greater organic growth, continued margin expansion, strong adjusted EPS growth and double-digit free cash flow growth for 2025. To summarize and before I hand the call to Edmund for a more detailed review of our financials and outlook, we want to reinforce how excited our leadership team is for the opportunity ahead. We're executing against our strategy through the 3x3 Plan. Our solutions are helping clients as they face increasing volatility and complexity in their businesses. We're delivering results, including mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow growth in line with our long-term financial model in 2024. NFP is right on track. And finally, the significant progress we made in 2024 positions Aon for another strong year in 2025 to deliver on our client, colleague and financial objectives. Of course, none of this would be possible without Aon's global team. And on behalf of Edmund, Eric and me, I will conclude my comments by first, reinforcing our foundational commitment to our team to ensure that Aon fosters a culture and work environment strengthened by the power of inclusion, built to attract, develop and retain the best talent in the world from all backgrounds. And second, just shout out a huge thank you to our 60,000 colleagues around the world for serving our clients with distinction and for making 2024 a tremendous year. Let me now turn to Edmund to walk through the financials and provide additional insight around our expectations for 2025. Edmund?
Edmund Reese: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here discussing the results from yet another strong quarter that caps strong full year 2024 performance and positions us to achieve our 2024 to 2026 3x3 Plan financial objectives. Before jumping into these results and providing 2025 guidance, I want to take a moment to highlight some critical milestones achieved in 2024 that demonstrate the strong progress that we've made toward our commitments. First, our full year performance is right in line with our objectives and guidance from mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin and free cash flow. In particular, organic revenue growth reached 6% for the year, giving us confidence in our 3x3 Plan and our investments in hiring client-facing talent, developing client-facing ABS capabilities and expanding our Enterprise Client Group will support mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth. Second, we completed the acquisition of NFP, which expanded our presence in the $31 billion and fast-growing middle market. In 2024, we saw strong producer retention better than 2023, accretive top line financial results and $36 million in middle-market acquired EBITDA with a robust Q1 '25 pipeline, all in line with our expectations. Third, we paid down $2.1 billion in debt and returned $1.6 billion in capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases, lowering our leverage in line with our objectives and continuing our balanced capital allocation discipline. We are executing our plan. And these milestones emphasize that with year one of our 3x3 Plan complete, we have momentum. And continued execution gives us a high level of confidence in delivering on our 3x3 financial objectives, including a double-digit three year CAGR and free cash flow from 2023 to 2026. You can see from the financial summary on Slide 6 that full year total revenue increased 17% to $16 billion, and we delivered 6% organic revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 17%, and adjusted operating margin was 31.5%, up 90 basis points relative to a '23 baseline that includes NFP. Adjusted EPS was up 10% to $15.60. And finally, we generated $2.8 billion of free cash flow, reflecting strong adjusted operating income growth and continued working capital improvements. Turning to the fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth was also 6%, marking a third consecutive quarter of growth at 6% or greater. Adjusted operating margin was 33.3%, expanding 140 basis points relative to a '23 baseline that includes NFP, and adjusted EPS was up 14% to $4.42. Let's get into the details of these results, starting with organic revenue growth on Slide 8. In Q4, organic revenue growth of 6% was right on track and in line with our mid-single digit or greater guidance range. In Commercial Risk, organic revenue growth was 6% in Q4 and was broad-based, reflecting strength in our North American core P&C business, continued strong contribution from our International businesses and an uptick in construction as we're beginning to see the impact from specialty hires. We also benefited from double-digit growth in M&A services as increased transaction activity continued to be a modest tailwind. Reinsurance organic revenue reached 6% in Q4 '24, growing over an elevated Q4 '23 on the back of continued strength in our strategy and technology group, strong treaty placements with existing clients and increased insurance-linked securities. Specifically, interest in catastrophe bonds continue to grow as investors seek unique asset classes with uncorrelated returns, and Aon is the leading industry provider in cat bond placements. Health Solutions grew 5% in Q4 '24, also against a high Q4 '23 comparable. Growth in core health and benefits as well as in NFP executive benefits and pharmacy benefits was partially offset by lower revenue in talent solutions. Finally, Wealth Solutions delivered 8% organic revenue growth in Q4 driven by continued strong demand for pension risk transfer consulting, regulatory work from policy changes across the U.K. and EMEA and new clients and market performance in NFP. Our Q4 organic revenue growth was powered by new business, which contributed 12 points from both existing and new clients as well as a modest contribution from M&A services as I mentioned earlier. And with continued high retention in the mid-90s, supported by the increasing deployment of our ABS capabilities, as Greg mentioned, net new business drove the 6 points of organic revenue growth. The net market impact from growth in exposures and rates was flat. Reinsurance did have a modestly negative rate impact in the fourth quarter, consistent with early views of 1/1 renewals as capital capacity, up 7% for the year, outstripped demand. We saw the lower rates in reinsurance offset with modest rate benefit across commercial, health and wealth. For the full year, each of the solution lines across Risk Capital and Human Capital were well within or above our mid-single-digit or greater growth objective, with Commercial Risk at 5% and all other solution lines growing at or above 6%. And I'll add that if measured separately, NFP and Aon are both generating mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Turning now on to margins on Slide 10. Adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 33.3%, expanding 140 basis points from our combined baseline with NFP. On a full year basis, adjusted operating margin was 31.5%, and we delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion relative to our combined baseline with NFP. We continue to drive adjusted operating margin expansion due to scale in our business, particularly through Aon Business Services, our continued portfolio management and the shift in mix to higher-margin businesses as well as ongoing expense discipline. And importantly, the benefit from our restructuring initiatives to accelerate our 3x3 Plan. We ended the year $10 million ahead of our restructuring plan objective. And savings in the fourth quarter were $40 million, resulting in a $110 million of savings for full year '24. Restructuring savings contributed approximately 100 basis points in Q4, and approximately 70 basis points to full year margin expansion. Looking ahead, we continue to expect an incremental $150 million of savings in 2025, and are well on track to achieve our stated objective of $350 million of run rate savings in 2026. Our strong organic growth and the actions that we are taking through ABS to standardize our operations and integrate our platforms are setting the foundation for ongoing margin expansion through operating leverage in our business. Moving to interest, other income and taxes on Slide 11. Interest expense of $206 million in the quarter was up $82 million versus last year primarily reflecting the issuance of $7 billion in debt to fund the NFP acquisition. We expect approximately $205 million of interest expense in Q1 '25. Other income expense was a $60 million benefit year-over-year primarily due to the favorable net impact of gains from balance sheet currency exposures and our hedging program. And finally, the Q4 tax rate was 17%, bringing the full year rate to 20%, with the year-over-year increase driven by growth in higher tax geographies, the unfavorable impact of discrete items and policy changes across the globe. Let's now discuss free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 12. We generated $2.8 billion of free cash flow in 2024, reflecting strong operating income growth and continued working capital improvements driven by the continued progress on our goal to improve days sales outstanding. While free cash flow was impacted in 2024 by extraordinary items, all of which we've previously communicated, including the NFP transaction and integration costs, restructuring and legal settlement expenses, we remain confident in underlying free cash flow growth. We continue to expect free cash flow to grow at a double-digit three year CAGR from 2023 to 2026. Our strong free cash flow allowed us to pay down $2.1 billion of debt in 2024 and coupled with earnings growth, lowered our debt-to-EBITDA leverage from 4.1x to 3.4x. So we are right on track to achieve a 2.8x to 3x leverage ratio in Q4 2025, consistent with the objective that we set when we announced the NFP acquisition. Additionally, we remained active in M&A, continuing our targeted tuck-in acquisitions across priority areas, including continued middle-market acquisitions through NFP, which acquired $36 million in EBITDA in 2024 and has a healthy pipeline of expected closings in Q1 '25. Our independent and connected strategy is resonating in the marketplace. And we continue to expect to acquire $45 million to $60 million of EBITDA through NFP middle market acquisition in 2025. Finally, in 2024, we returned $1.6 billion in capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of share repurchases. Our performance in 2024 is a great demonstration of our disciplined capital allocation model, beginning with strong free cash flow generation and capital allocation that balances high-return investments for growth with capital return to shareholders. I'll wrap up on Slide 13 with our 2025 guidance and a few concluding thoughts. In summary, our full year 2025 guidance is mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted margin expansion, strong adjusted EPS growth and double-digit free cash flow growth. Let me highlight the drivers of each guidance point, starting first with organic revenue growth. We expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth driven primarily from winning recurring new business from both new logos and existing clients, continued high retention and 0 to 2 points from the net market impact of rate and exposure. I'll note that our increased talent acquisition of revenue-generating roles in specialty areas and Enterprise Client Group hires, up 4% in 2024, is expected to contribute to organic revenue growth. Additionally, organic revenue growth is benefiting from our progress driving revenue synergies in NFP, and we remain committed to $80 million in NFP revenue synergies in 2025. Moving to adjusted operating margin. We expect to deliver continued margin expansion in 2025. And as we model the drivers of margin expansion, there are four components to consider. First, the net impact of four additional months of NFP, given the late April 2024 closing, and achieving $30 million in OpEx synergies will dilute margins by 20 basis points. I'll note that the impact of four additional months of NFP will primarily be a Q1 impact with the remaining impact in April 2025. Second, the interest rate impact on investment income from fiduciary balances is expected to dilute margins by 20 basis points. Third, and as I mentioned earlier, we expect an incremental $150 million in restructuring savings, which would drive approximately 85 basis points of margin expansion. Finally, we expect 35 to 45 basis points of margin expansion from the operating leverage in our business, given the progress that we've made in ABS to drive scale in our ongoing disciplined expense management. The net impact of these four items allows us to fund ongoing growth investments while still driving continued margin expansion in line with our historical performance. Given our outlook for mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted margin expansion and accretive NFP performance, we expect to deliver strong adjusted EPS growth in 2025. This guidance reflects our continued strong operating performance, partially offset by an approximately $0.32 or 2-point EPS headwind from FX rates based on today's FX rates remaining stable. It's also important to note that in Q1 '25, we estimate an approximately $110 million FX impact on total revenue and an approximately $0.16 or 3-point EPS headwind. Also embedded in this guidance is an expected tax rate of 19.5% to 20.5%, excluding any extraordinary discrete items. This tax rate considers the geographic mix of our growth and policy changes in the geographies where we are located. Additionally, we expect noncash pension and OIE to be $88 million compared to $48 million in 2024. This performance positions us for double-digit free cash flow growth in 2025, including over $300 million from NFP, driven by adjusted operating income growth and working capital improvements. Additionally, we expect to continue to return capital to shareholders in 2025, including $1 billion in share repurchases. Our 2025 guidance demonstrates the strength of our business and financial model and prioritizes investments that support sustainable organic revenue growth. Our execution in ABS is supporting both top line growth and creating investment capacity through margin expansion. As a result, we expect to deliver strong adjusted earnings per share growth and to generate double-digit free cash flow growth. And finally, we continue to have balanced capital allocation, investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders. And before closing, one logistical note. Effective this quarter, we will disclose adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin for two operating segments: Risk Capital and Human Capital. Risk Capital includes Commercial Risk and Reinsurance, and Human Capital includes Health and Wealth. These changes align our external reporting to our 3x3 Plan and how we go to market to serve clients. And they provide increased transparency to our investors on our ability to drive margin expansion across the enterprise. The changes do not impact Aon's reported revenue or consolidated results. And we will also provide recasted financials for the past three years in our 10-K, which will be filed and posted on our website in the coming weeks. I will close with four messages. First, Aon delivered strong Q4 financial results to close out a strong 2024, in line with our financial guidance. Second, we are executing on our 3x3 Plan, including our investments in client-facing capabilities in Aon Business Services, middle-market expansion and priority hiring to drive continued strong performance. Third, with our 2025 guidance, we are well positioned to continue Aon's long track record of delivering mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted margin expansion, strong adjusted EPS growth and double-digit free cash flow growth. Finally, we continue to have balanced capital allocation priorities, investing in growth, while returning capital to shareholders. So with that, let's jump into your questions. Rob, I'll turn it back to you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Kligerman: Hi, good morning. So on NFP, it sounds like eight months in, you've said the integration is on track. Edmund, you cited $45 million to $60 million in targeted acquired EBITDA this year. How does that $45 million to $60 million kind of stack up to past years, when NFP was independent? And I'm most curious about how well integrated is the platform such that, you could do another big deal? Like if you were - how do I say, if you felt a nice opportunity was out there, would you be able to do it now? Or is this something that's going to take another six to 12 months before you're comfortable?
Greg Case: Well, Andrew, first of all, really appreciate the questions in the background. I want to focus on the here and now and NFP in particular, and get Eric to comment on this as he's leading this across the firms. Listen, we had such high expectations with NFP coming in, and they've really been exceeded on every front. This combination, the independent and connected has worked exceptionally well from a client leader standpoint. And Eric can give some examples of that. The platforms have come together exceptionally well. Aon Business Services as it's connected to NFP has been extraordinarily positive. So from our standpoint, really from a revenue standpoint, organic standpoint, an operating standpoint, free cash flow standpoint, as Edmund described, feeling very, very good about the combination and all that's come with it, the access to the $31 billion market. So from our standpoint, this has been absolutely terrific. It's eight months in, as Edmund highlighted, with a long way to go, but my gosh, are we making progress in every single aspect of this. But Eric, you're leading it day-to-day. What are your thoughts?
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg. And Andrew, nice to be with you. I would say on the M&A piece on the historical context, it's similar to what they have done historically. They've always been very specific as they look to bring firms into their platform. So it's a continued process in terms of what they've been doing historically. And we've just been excited to see the opportunities that have come our way. And a lot of it is about this independent and connected strategy that we've engaged, both within our firm, but also within the broader marketplace. And it's helping us identify M&A targets, people that want to come to us that understand, what we're doing around keeping the platform independent, but connecting it to the capabilities that Aon has. And as Edmund and Greg both said, we saw some great growth across all three of their main core platforms. But - and maybe if I could, just to describe it for you, because I think it would help people to understand exactly what we mean by connected. Now we think about it in kind of three buckets. We've got the, let's call it, the utilization of the Aon network. And just an example, one of the NFP clients is a major sports league, where they used our global broking center in London, accessing the Aon client treaty to get more capacity, for a challenging renewal that they were facing. I would say the other - the second one would be industry and product specialization where, as another example, NFP had a professional services client, who they were working in the health arena. And they were able to partner, with our team that had a focus in that industry in the risk area. And together, we're able to now provide risk capability services for that client. And then the third is sort of cross risk capital, where they have an MGA that needed reinsurance support. And so, we were able to use Aon reinsurance capability to help the MGA that is part of NFP, get capacity and better reinsurance terms. So there's a lot happening. The connection between the teams, always hard to describe on a call like this, but the work and effort and energy, and positive intent around creating growth, and opportunities across the platforms has been, as Greg said, it exceeded our expectations and really looking forward to getting added in '25.
Andrew Kligerman: Got it. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is around Reinsurance Solutions. I mean that 6% organic growth was great, because it was on really tough comps. And one of the areas you called out was the ILS market where you're number one. And I think on the call, maybe Edmund mentioned cat bonds. But it seems like ILS is really just proliferating. I mean you've got cyber bond now. How big of our business relative to the overall revenues of reinsurance is ILS? And could that be a big driver of continued better than expected organic growth?
Eric Andersen: So I would say the ILS business, continues to be a very sort of boutique business within reinsurance in terms of the scale, of the traditional reinsurance treaties on property cat, and liability and specialty that you would know. I think one of the interesting things about the ILS market that we're so excited about, sort of fits underneath this Risk Capital framework. The ability to bring that type of capability, whether it's cat bond for property, whether it's cyber, as you mentioned, over into the corporate space and being able to sit down with a large corporate client, who has a huge real estate portfolio, very diversified in their own right, and have access to capital that's essentially driven by the ILS structure into the capital markets, just gives them another tool as they look to transfer risk across. So the insurers are obviously still users, and continues to manage the tail risk on what you would call a cat bond. But you are seeing interest in the corporate market, on the primary market, looking at those types of structures, whether in the form of a parametric bond or an ILS cat bond. And that's just one of the examples, where the teams of reinsurance and insurance, are working closely together. But Edmund, what would you add?
Edmund Reese: Yes. Let me just add a point. The - relative to the overall portfolio, Andrew, it's a smaller component, but it is driving growth. And that's part of the beauty of the reinsurance business, but Aon overall is the broad-based growth that we're seeing. So we saw a contribution from the ILS securities. We saw a contribution from our strategy and technology group. If you listen to my prepared remarks, you saw that I actually called that out first, in addition to our ongoing growth, with the largest part of our reinsurance business in treaty and in fact as well. So that dynamic is across each one of our solution lines, where it's broad-based, and we're seeing growth maybe incrementally in one area relative to the others. But at the end of the day, it comes back to me - it comes back down to like our ability to be able to retain, these reinsurance clients and our ability to bring more capital solutions, and other options to the table for them to help be able to drive that growth. With our existing clients and bringing new clients to it. So that's the key thing, when we think about the overall growth impact, and profile for Aon moving forward.
Andrew Kligerman: Thanks much for the insights.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
David Motemaden: Good morning. I had a question on some of the components for the mid-single-digit, or greater outlook. And thanks, Edmund, for some of those. I guess I'm wondering, so zero to two points from the net market impact of rate and exposure. Could you help me think through retention improvement efforts that might be a tailwind, to growth as well as what you guys have assumed, for a rebound in M&A services versus where it was in 2024?
Edmund Reese: Yes, yes. Sorry, I think Greg was on mute, maybe saying something there. So I'm going to jump in here on this, and Greg, are you back or...
Greg Case: Go ahead. Go ahead, Edmund, please.
Edmund Reese: Sorry about that. We're just - a little technical difficulty here. It's a great question, like the components of it. Your question was really on the retention. It was on the M&A services, but organic revenue growth overall. So just a step back, but the key thing for me, first of all, is that we just finished a strong quarter and a strong year, 6% on organic revenue growth. That gives me a lot of confidence that what we're doing to be able to drive it, across the broad-based set of solutions that I just talked about, is a, it's a strong position to be in year one of our plan. But importantly, it's the momentum going in the fiscal 2025, and that's where your question begins. What are the drivers with that? First, for me, it really is the new business and from existing clients and new clients. And the trends there are healthy, right? We just - I think I said in my remarks, Q4 ended with 12 points of contribution in that space, including the M&A service, which is modest right now given where it is. And I've commented that you need superior growth, maybe four times the overall business to see - be a significant impact to our business, and it's modest right now. We're seeing pickup there. But the trends are healthy. 12 points of contribution from that new business, including M&A in Q4, 10 points in the full year, sort of 0.1. I think as you think about your modeling and the things that's going to sustain our growth, be aware of the priority hiring. We specifically called out the double-digit growth in construction. We called out - or at least I'll call out now the double-digit growth that, I saw in energy. Those are areas that we've been focused and hiring on, and we're starting to see contribution from them as well. That will support our mid-single-digit organic growth. And then you just heard Eric just highlighting the strength in NFP, over the first month. And so that point that we made about $80 million in synergies, that will also - that's one of the things that strengthens and gives us confidence in that mid-single-digit growth. I appreciate the fact that you brought up retention, because we've been seeing strengthening retention particularly in our commercial risk business, particularly in North America, given the work that Laurie and our leadership team in North America has been driving. So I expect continued mid-single 90s performance there. And I'll actually add the rollout of the ABS capabilities that Greg mentioned in his comments is also supporting that retention. Now market impact is the thing that moves up and down. I think it's a reasonable assumption to have that it would be zero to two points impact this year here. And I think the early signs that we see from things like 1/1 renewals suggests that we're right in line with our plan here. So I just have super high confidence in margin, and top line growth. And maybe I'll just turn it to Eric for any comments he'd add to that.
Eric Andersen: Sure. I think it sort of goes into the talent question, right, in terms of as you mentioned, the specific hires that we're making in growth areas around energy, around construction, around middle market. Where I think the culture and the message and the analytic tools that we are developing for clients, is actually drawing talent in. But when you think about the - going back to the retention question. The reality is getting our 65,000 colleagues making sure that they're well trained, well supported either through industry specialization or product specialization, segmentation, all of that provides a better outcome for our clients. So when you think about the team and its expertise, and you match it with the tools that are being developed in ABS, followed by the service capabilities. All of that delivers the client experience that we're looking for, for them. And that comes across in the 3x3 strategy Greg was talking about in his opening remarks. So I think when you put all that together, getting that strong foundation of client retention, is the key to growth and is the key to sort of long-term value creation for clients.
David Motemaden: Great. Thanks. And then maybe, Edmund, just following up there on - you had commented that you're seeing strengthening retention in North America, within commercial risk. Is that back - or is that sort of at historic levels, below historic levels? Is there continued room for improvement there specifically, just to get back to where we were historically? Or some elaboration on that point would be helpful?
Eric Andersen: Sure. Maybe - this is Eric. I'll take that one. Listen, there's always room for improvement in retention until it's at 100%. And so, we're maniacally focused on making sure we are keeping all of our clients, and serving them all well. But to get to your direct question, is it back towards historical norms? The answer to that is yes. But we are looking - we're never satisfied with historical norms. We're always trying to improve, which is what's driving the - when you think about 3x3 strategy and the Risk Capital, Human Capital framework, that's one of the reasons we did it. The ability to show a client, the global capability around capital on the risk side, it's the ability to connect the global network, and talk about talent and health and wealth together, to provide more value to clients. And then powered by a series of tools and capabilities that, are unmatched in the industry. You put that around a segmentation strategy, an industry-focused strategy, and that's a winning formula for us, and not only for clients, but for prospective people to join the firm. And so, we feel good about the progress we've made in '24. There's always work to do, but we feel good as we're going into '25.
David Motemaden: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on commercial risk, and I guess the setup into the Q1, right? We've had a couple of brokers, right, that have flagged, I guess, seasonally softer Q1s in their retail brokerage businesses. But I would think for you guys, some of the items you mentioned, Edmund, like hiring coming online, et cetera, will help, but also you guys have an easier year-over-year comp. So do you think does the setup for Q1 seems seasonally stronger in commercial risk?
Edmund Reese: I think overall, Elyse.
Eric Andersen: Go ahead, Edmund.
Edmund Reese: I think overall, Elyse, there's nothing about our Q1 to highlight in terms of seasonality. The things that I'd point out within our guidance are just - on the top line, the FX impact that I pointed out in my prepared remarks, when we think about the interest rate impact on fiduciary investment income, which doesn't impact organic, but it does have an impact on total revenue. Those are the only two things that I would say, are out of normal sort of performance in Q1. Other than that, there's nothing that I'd highlight about seasonality or performance there.
Greg Case: And I captured it very well Edmund, at least step back for a second and you think about overall where we are from a growth standpoint. We are very committed to the mid-single-digit, or greater as you think about 2025 across the board. Again, just come back why at a macro level, look, we operate in a very diverse market across risk, retirement, health and talent, and that includes on the commercial risk front. The markets as we said, are growing. And literally, these megatrends that we've talked about on various calls around trade, technology, wealth, weather and workforce are meaningful. They're real. Our clients are seeing them every day. And remember, the market is still relatively underpenetrated. And you take all that and you essentially say demand is increasing, and we've got to be able to react to it. To react to it requires a connected response, and all that we're doing with 3x3. So literally, we are going to show up on Monday as Aon in the property symposium in Miami. It's going to be 500 clients strong. The entire property market is going to stand still for three days, with the biggest buyers and the biggest markets in the world, sitting there looking at the next iteration of our analyzer tool on the property side, and really talking about their strategies on property. So for us, it's really about demand, and how it's evolved and about our capability to respond to it, and why we're committed to achieving the mid-single-digit, or greater and expect that through 2025.
Elyse Greenspan: Is the $45 million to $60 million of EBITDA from M&A from NFP that you mentioned, Edmund, is that included within your 2025 guidance?
Edmund Reese: Yes. Yes, it is, both on the revenue impact associated, with that is captured in the margin and the overall earnings growth as well. So all of that is embedded.
Elyse Greenspan: And then one last one. Sorry, go ahead.
Edmund Reese: No, go ahead. I'm sorry, Elyse, go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: On the $1 billion, you guys gave the buyback for '25, and you said, right, you'll kind of be within your leverage target at the end of the year. So should we expect that maybe we could see a step-up in share repurchase in '26, just given right that you'll be done with leverage management actions post NFP?
Edmund Reese: Yes. So I mean, I'll start off by saying capital, free cash flow generation, in particular, was a point of strength for us in 2024, right? We are certainly focused on continuing to generate free cash flow in 2025. That's going to come from the operating income, that's going to come from the earnings. We're going to paydown the debt, get to the leverage ratio and be focused on that. We think that allows us to have capacity as we think about the pipeline that we have in M&A right now, and still return that capital in '25 to shareholders. As we get through '25 and closer to 2026, we'll come and give guidance on that point more - with more detail.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. First, I just had a question on your financial guidance. It seems like you're fairly specific on organic growth and on cash flows, but somewhat vague on EPS growth. So just trying to think about what strong EPS growth means. Does it mean double-digits? Or if not then just like, maybe highlight some of the key points that could make it be double-digits, or fall short of that?
Edmund Reese: Yes. And in fact - look, I think that the guidance that we gave is quite detailed when you tick through it. We gave such detailed guidance, because we have such high confidence in the plan. So I just talked about the organic revenue growth component. And if you think about what I said in the prepared remarks about margin expansion, that's quite detailed, four components that should net between 80 and 90 basis points of margin expansion. So that gives you a sense there on the operating side of the business. We talked about organic revenue growth. I gave you four items that's quite clear on the margin expansion that should net to 80 to 90 basis points, which is right in line with our historical performance. To continue with EPS, I think there are a couple of other things to keep in mind, the non-operating items. The FX impact, a $0.32 or two points headwind, the OIE impact for pension that drives into it. And you should be able to get, depending upon your assumption for mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, or greater organic revenue growth, you should be able to get to an adjusted EPS number. So look, again, I think that is quite detailed guidance, because we have a high level of confidence in that plan. The guidance corresponds with it. So we're excited, to continue to execute, and we think we're right on track to be able to hit our 2025, and our overall 3x3 objectives.
Greg Case: And Jimmy, just if I could add to that a little bit. First, I just - I do want to step back, Edmund's point around the insight and the guidance provided, as we've completed the year really, is a substantial step-up from what we were before. So credit to Edmund and the finance team for sort of bringing that perspective in view. It really does help you decompose in a more effective way. And as Edmund said in his comments, it's intended fully to give you more confidence in our ability, to continue to maintain what have been decade-long trends in terms of operating improvement. And you see that. You do step back, think about it, all the different challenges and opportunities that Edmund teed up, we've encountered those for the last decade plus. And if you think about it, it's 11% free cash flow growth and 11% EPS growth over a decade plus in the context of movements in FX, and movements in interest rates, and movements in inflation, and movements in the market. And so, we want to give you as much transparency as we can, but be confident we're going to work the play to do what we do, to drive client and colleague impact. But the yield and outcomes around financial performance. And that's what you'll see us do.
Jimmy Bhullar: And then maybe a follow-up on your long-term strategy for share buybacks. Is there a change going forward than what you've done in the past? I guess in 2025, you are sort of going to be deleveraging. But beyond that, should we assume that you're going to be fairly consistent in terms of deploying capital towards buybacks? Or is the balance going to be more shifting for M&A, or other uses?
Greg Case: Listen, I want Edmund to comment on that specifically. But just for backdrop, step back, Jimmy, remember our view, we're focused on clients and colleagues, with an outcome and a yield that comes out of that, is driven by free cash flow and free cash flow growth. And that's the 11% number for the decade plus. Part of that is capital allocation, absolutely central. So your question is exactly right, but step back and understand our orientation, is what it has always been. It's a return on invested capital, cash-on-cash return. We're making allocations inorganic. We're making allocations in buyback, in M&A and building the strength of our firm. And in doing so, we're going to drive the yields that I just described. So for us, that hasn't changed at all, and we'll continue to evaluate and drive what we do based on that orientation. What we hope you come away with, is a renewed enthusiasm for what the 3x3 Plan has done for that. The investment in Risk Capital and Human Capital creates real opportunity for us. Enterprise client and Aon client leadership creates real opportunity for us. And then really, ABS is such a unique asset that we have cultivated for seven-plus, eight-plus years that, is now really coming online as part of the 3x3 Plan, all of which is, we think, going to generate extraordinarily strong free cash flow, again, reinforced by NFP. So from our standpoint, we've got a lot to do with a great free cash flow pool coming online. And we'll take the same approach, we've always taken in the context of overall allocation, as things come along. But Edmund, what would you add to that? You're coordinating this and orchestrating.
Edmund Reese: Not much, Greg, because I think you hit it, when you said there's been no change to the capital allocation policy right here. We are, to your point, very much focused on investing for growth and capital return to shareholders and having that balance right. So in 2025, we're clearly going to be focused on getting back to the leverage objectives that we want. But we think the free cash flow strength gives us capacity, to evaluate weight, the right opportunities that meet our strategic criteria, and meet our financial criteria and if not, return that capital back to our shareholders. That has worked for our shareholders and benefited our shareholders long before I came here. So we're certainly not changing that.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Charles Lederer: Hi, good morning. This is Charlie on for Mike. First question, does the tax rate guidance contemplate OECD Pillar Two agreements? And is there still uncertainty around tax rates there in the coming year? Thanks.
Edmund Reese: Yes, there's always uncertainty around tax. But let me just maybe step back. And the short answer to your question, is it contemplates what we know today. Obviously, this is an environment that's changing. And so it contemplates what we know today. When you step back, though, the complexity of operating in 120 countries, our tax rate really just comes down to growing in those higher-tax geographies. Germany is at 33%, Australia is at 30%. Canada is at 27%. The impact of discrete is the number two item, and there's a long tail for the impact of tax returns from prior years and recently, the policy changes, like the ones that you were just mentioning. The complexity, though, in calibrating those three items over multiyear time periods, that complexity is real. But to a point that Greg made earlier, we took some extra time. We thought through the scenarios, because we had an objective to getting to a target range for tax that we're confident in, and that we feel comfortable sharing externally. And that range is 19.5% to 20.5%, which is right in line with 2024 and captures all that we know today. The key point from my perspective is that allows us to continue to grow internationally, which means more resilient earnings for us. And that tax rate still allows us to invest. So we feel comfortable with that range given all the work that we've done and what we know today. If more reveals itself, we'll come back and let you know.
Greg Case: And Charlie, just reinforces the - if you think about historically, our capability on the balance sheet capital side and what's happening in this category too, it's been very, very strong. And what Edmund and the team have done has really provided a level of clarity, with a 19.5% to 20.5% guidance for 2025, which is a first for us. Really, it gives you a way to kind of think about the modeling of this. With the best reflection that we've got, reflecting historical strength and our ability to adapt as the world continues to evolve. You've highlighted where it might evolve, and we'll see how it plays. But for now, we're very comfortable with this. And again, kudos and credit to our broader finance team, on the work they did to pull this off, and get this in front of you.
Charles Lederer: Thanks, that's very helpful. Maybe just going back to free cash flow growth this year. Could you go through some of the puts and takes? I think you have more accelerating Aon United spend ahead of you, maybe have some integration costs that don't recur. I think there was a legal settlement this year, but any other items we should be thinking about in the context of the double-digit free cash flow guidance?
Edmund Reese: You did a great job of hitting the items. Maybe just to round it all out, so obviously, the operating income growth, the working capital. I start with those two items. You hit the extraordinary items when you talked about the integration charges, and that is winding down, but there's still some impact from that. Of course, we don't have the legal expense charge that you talked about. And there will still be Aon United charges. Remember, when the team gave information on that, we said roughly about just about $410 million between '25 and '26 when you think about the overall $900 million that we have. The key item I'd add to what you said is the NFP contribution. We committed to $300 million in 2025 - free cash flow from that. And so I think about that as well. Put all those items together, it gives us high confidence in the double-digit growth in 2025.
Greg Case: And Charlie, remember, take a step back for a second. We began 3x3 as you think about where we closed 2023. And we have essentially said, we are committed to double-digit growth from 2023 to 2026 and beyond. But the 3x3 period was '24, '25 and '26. So as you sort of think about the puts and takes in the middle, if you want to make the math simple, step back, look at the baseline from 2023, think about what double-digit means. And we are absolutely committed to that outcome as we finish 2026 with momentum going into 2027 and beyond. So it's an easy way to kind of step back and really understand where we are and how we think about free cash flow growth. And it absorbs all the puts, and takes sort of in the middle that make that happen. So be confident in that and what Edmund's described, is what happened in 2024 just reinforced that confidence, as we think about double-digit from '23 to '26 and then beyond.
Charles Lederer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.
Robert Cox: Hi, thanks. Good morning. And thanks for the comments on the construction and energy hires, Edmund. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you said 4% growth in specialty revenue-generating roles, or something similar. I'm curious how does that translate into the organic increase in talent, for revenue-generating roles and overall Risk Capital? And if you could talk about how that compares to Aon's history and sort of what you expect going forward?
Greg Case: Rob, I don't think we're going to end up going sort of into all those details. Take a step back, what you take away from this is, we're investing in priority areas. And it is the pieces that Edmund highlighted around energy and construction, but it's also in health and a number of other areas, very, very, very high priority areas for us. And we're going to continue to do that. You've seen them begin to come online. Edmund described it takes some time here, 12 to 18 months, but they're coming online. But this isn't a one-time thing for us. What Edmund's described as a machine and an engine, which generates free cash flow, we're going to continue to allocate to priority hires in frontline areas that matter for us. And also remember, when someone comes into Aon, this is not about just another person on the line. We want them to have content capability, the tools to actually amplify what they do as they come in. And that's really what the analyzers give us, and the service gives us and ABS gives us. So for us, this is a priority Edmund highlighted. Eric emphasized it as well. It'll continue to sort of reinforce. It isn't fully online now, but you'll see it coming over the course of the next '25 and '26 and '27 and beyond. We're excited about it. It's still relatively small in the scheme of things. But it's not -- it's meaningful in terms of sort of the 4% addition to sort of overall capability. And you see that, by the way, in Risk Capital, in reinsurance and in commercial risk and priority areas. You see it in health. You see it in retirement and talent in the priority areas, too. So it really is across the board, and we're going to continue to drive this on an ongoing basis.
Robert Cox: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to switch to reinsurance. I know you guys called out the lower reinsurance rate impact in the quarter, but we're still able to strongly outgrow that. If I recall correctly, Aon is overweight property reinsurance, because of Benfield. Do you think reinsurance solutions, can continue to grow at similar levels, as we get into the bigger revenue quarters that, are kind of more driven by treaty renewals?
Eric Andersen: I would say certainly our ability to grow globally as it's truly a global business is something the team has been very focused on, certainly for the last five years that we continue to be optimistic about the future of reinsurance as we go into 2025, both in the property cat space, as you mentioned, but also in what we do for casualty and specialty and facultative and strategy and technology. It's really become a fully built portfolio of capability, not just property cat. So you should think about it as broader offerings, and broader capabilities than just property catastrophe. Certainly, there is a market impact as you're alluding to, and I think you probably heard. I would just say that clients react to declining markets differently, their ability to do buydowns. Aggregate covers, sideways covers, top-up programs where they may have pulled back a bit based on pricing. So it's a pretty dynamic market, and clients to optimize their portfolios, as they look at the amount of spending they can win in. But we're excited about it going forward.
Edmund Reese: And Rob, only one point to add, which is embedded in our plan, and in our guidance that we gave, are these dynamics that Eric is discussing with the weighting of the portfolio and what happens on the rate and exposure side associated with it. So with all of that in mind, we feel very confident in the mid-single-digit, or greater organic revenue growth is where I'd leave on that point.
Robert Cox: Great. Thanks for all the color.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: Just wanted to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. We appreciate it, and look forward to next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-25 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature, as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2024 results, as well as having been posted on our website. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm joined by Edmund Reese, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. And we're especially delighted to have Edmund here, leading his first quarterly earnings call as our CFO. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website and the webcast slides which Edmund will reference in his remarks. To begin, We want to extend our deepest sympathies to those impacted by recent natural disasters, including from hurricanes, flooding and typhoons around the world, particularly hurricane Helene and Milton. In these times of challenge, as communities endure the tragic loss of life and tremendous damage, our actions as a firm focus especially hard on helping businesses and communities respond and recover. To our 60,000 colleagues who make this possible, thank you and all you do and for your tireless commitment and dedication to our clients. Together, we're executing our 3x3 Plan on each of the three pillars, delivering risk capital and human capital solutions through the Aon Client Leadership Model, scaled by our Aon Business Services operating platform. This is a monumental effort and we're seeing it in our results. Year-to-date financial performance represents great progress and puts us well on track to achieve our goals in 2024 and over the long-term. Highlighting our results and key messages from the quarter and year-to-date in Q3, our team delivered 7% total organic revenue growth, with all solution lines at 6% or greater, and consistent organic revenue growth from Aon and NFP. With this organic growth and the addition of NFP, we delivered 26% total revenue growth, 28% adjusted operating income growth, and adjusted operating margin of 24.6%, and increase of 70 basis points year-over-year from our combined 2023 margin baseline. Year-to-date, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, 15% total revenue growth, and 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion from our baseline, including roughly five months with NFP, contributing to 15% adjusted operating income growth and 9% growth in earnings per share. We also made progress on de-levering, executing attractive M&A, and returning capital to shareholders with 800 million share buyback year-to-date. NFP continues to perform exceptionally well, exactly in-line with expectations for top-line growth, cost of revenue synergies, free cash flow, and ongoing M&A activity, all executed through our independent and connected operating strategy. Overall, we remain fully on track to achieve our financial guidance for mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin expansion and double digit free cash flow growth over the long-term, all supported by disciplined capital management. As we reflect on future client demand and our momentum, we would offer a few observations. In every industry and region, our clients are telling us that it's getting harder to make decisions across risk and people issues. They face increasing volatility as decision-making becomes more complex, requires deeper insights, stronger partnerships and more innovative solutions. Businesses are demanding urgent action and we're well-positioned to respond with exceptional solutions in our core business and with the development and delivery of content, capability and expertise that helps clients effectively address their challenges. Our 3x3 Plan is designed to meet these needs across the pillars of risk capital, human capital, Aon Client Leadership, and Aon Business Services. Leveraging our structure to unlock new integrated solutions to support our clients. A recent client example highlights this opportunity across all 3 pillars of our plan. Our Client, a leading global construction company, needed a partner who could help in place one of the largest insurance programs in the marketplace for their contractors, with seamless support and connection across multiple geographies. Historically, the program consisted of multiple regional placements, creating inefficiencies, which were growing with our clients' own rapid business growth. To do this, our global team brought regional data and insights from our analytic tools together in a more efficient global placement, supported by enhanced service delivery. Collectively, we delivered a program for our clients that enabled them to maintain coverage, optimize their placement process, improve transparency, and deliver savings. Our team's seamless work demonstrated the differentiated value that we bring without silos, underscored by the financial advantage and innovation made possible through risk capital insights and AI business services. And as we think about AI business services, our data analytics were a meaningful part of this win. And this is only the beginning, not only for this client but much more broadly. As we have often highlighted, a primary element of our strategy is bringing together our data analytics, operations and platforms to deliver insight in more powerful ways at scale. Because of the steps we've taken to build one platform and business services, we can develop tools and capabilities that effectively use AI today and evolve in the future with capabilities like new climate risk data and our property analyzer, with insight around medical innovation, demographics and claims, and our health risk analyzer. The investments we're making are helping to ensure we can continue to develop these advanced analytic tools and deliver differentiated value for clients, further strengthening our relationships and enable us to do more with them. Finally, highlighting NFP. We remain even more excited than when we announced and closed the deal and remain exactly on track to our expectations. NFP's performance in the quarter continues to reinforce this thesis, reflecting great work by our combined teams. One area that we're really seeing strength is what we're building on NFPs strong client relationships by bringing additional content capabilities and tools to our NFP team. Let me briefly highlight two examples of how our independent and connected operating strategy is driving value for clients and is accretive to Aon’s performance. In our commercial risk business, NFP colleagues can now bring our CyQu tool to clients. This capability lets our clients analyze and understand their cyber risk in terms of underlying risk, mitigation factors, and insurance cost drivers. This is a powerful tool for clients of all sizes, and the benefit is resonating with our NFP teams and clients. Similarly, in health solutions, we're seeing great success with our Health Efficiency Analyzer. This analytic capability helps clients understand health program dynamics across their population and across geographies, enabling actions to better assess drivers of spend, improve ROI, and manage healthcare investments for their people. Finally, our independent and connected operating strategy is resonating with our NFP colleagues and with our NFP M&A pipeline targets and with talented potential new hires, who appreciate and understand the operating flexibility and additional value that being part of Aon can bring to their clients. In summary, our Q3 and year-to-date results demonstrate strong progress against our financial guidance. We're taking meaningful steps to continue to deliver great capability to our clients through our 3x3 Plan, ensuring we bring relevant solutions to our clients, all enabled through Aon Business Services. We remain confident in our strategy, our financial guidance and outlook, and our ability to drive long-term value creation for our clients, our colleagues, and shareholders. Now, let me turn to Edmund for his thoughts on our financial results and outlook. Edmund?
Edmund Reese : Thank you, Greg, And good morning, everyone. I joined Aon a little over three months ago, and I couldn't be more excited to be a part of this company, given the opportunities ahead of us. My confidence in the financial model, delivering organic revenue growth, margin expansion, and double-digit free cash flow over the long-term is only increased. In the immediate term, I'm pleased to be here delivering the third quarter results and before jumping into the detail, let me elevate what matters most. First after a strong Q3, we're right on track to deliver a full year 2024 in-line with our objectives and guidance, including mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted margin expansion, and free cash flow generation that allows us to de-lever while simultaneously returning $1 billion in capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Second, our organic revenue growth reached 7% in the third quarter. Importantly, this performance was strong across the enterprise with organic revenue growth of 6% or higher in each of our solution lines. This is a direct result of executing our 3x3 Plan and the investments that we’re making to drive top-line growth, beginning with our investment in higher client facing talent and specialty areas, expanding our client group to now nearly 450 clients and further expanding our integrated risk data predictive analyzers across property, casualty, D&O, cyber, and health. And finally, the investment thesis on NFP remains, as we're off to a strong start with NFP performing in-line or better than the metrics that we measure in the business case. With five months' results since the acquisition, NFP's year-to-date organic revenue growth is strong. Retention is better than last year on top of a solid recruiting pipeline, and the M&A middle market growth engine is humming, having acquired $26 million in EBITDA year-to-date. These acquired firms are seeing value in our independent and connected model, connected to Aon content and capabilities, while maintaining an independent distribution and service model. Overall, we have momentum in our continued execution of the 3x3 strategy and creating investment capacity and margin expansion by delivering on our restructuring saves, gives me a high level of confidence in delivering on our near and long-term financial objectives, including a double digit three year CAGR and free cash flow from 2023 to 2026. I'll add one logistical note before turning to the results. You'll notice that we took the opportunity to add content with the intention of providing additional transparency and clarity into our performance and expectations, and to help you better understand the connection between our strategy and performance. You can expect that we'll have minor adjustments to refine our material over the next few calls to support greater engagement with our investors and our analysts. So now turning to the third quarter results in the financial summary on Slide 6. You see that we delivered 7% organic revenue growth in the third quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 24.6% up 30 basis points. And I'll remind you that we look at our margin expansion relative to a 2023 baseline that includes NFP. And when doing so operating margin expanded 70 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was up 17% to $2.72. And finally, we generated $951 million in free cash flow, bringing our total to three quarters to $1.7 billion. Let's get into the details of these results, starting with organic revenue growth on Slide 8. Organic revenue growth of 7% in Q3 2024 was at a high end of our mid-single-digit or greater guidance range. Growth in commercial risk was again strong at 6% with all of their solution lines growing at or above 7%. In commercial risk, organic revenue growth was 6% in Q3 and reflected strength in our North American core P&C business, driven by net new business and strong retention, as well as double-digit growth in M&A services and continued strong performance in the EMEA. Reinsurance with 7% organic revenue growth in Q3, was led by a balanced contribution to growth from our treaty and facultative placements. It's worth noting that our outlook on the seasonally smaller fourth quarter is for low single-digit growth given lower FAC revenue and the impact of growing over an elevated Q4 2023. We expect full year organic growth to achieve our mid-single digit or greater growth objective. Health Solutions delivered 9% organic revenue growth with double-digit growth in our international markets from new business and core health and benefits and data analytics-driven sales in our talent business. The market demand environment continues to reflect increased health cost trends and positive impacts from enrollment levels. I'll also mention that in the fourth quarter we'll be growing over an elevated Q4 2023. And finally, wealth solutions, organic revenue growth with 7%, driven by continued strong demand for pension risk transfer and regulatory changes across the UK and the EMEA, and a positive contribution from NFP. And let me also provide some additional color on NFP. NFP was accretive to commercial risk and wealth solutions and delivered mid-single-digit growth and health. NFP and Aon are both producing mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, and NFP is performing in-line with our business case. Overall, organic revenue growth continues to be driven by net new business and strong retention. I'll provide a little color in how net new business growth and market impact helped us deliver our 7% organic revenue growth. As you think about the 7%, recurring new business from new logos and existing clients contributed 10 points to growth. And with continued high retention, net new business contributed 5 points to organic growth. The net market impact from growth and exposures and rate was 2 points. We saw flat rate impacts and reinsurance with limit increases and rate benefit across commercial health and wealth. I'll also pause here and note that we continue to make great progress on our priority talent acquisition with continuing focus on hiring specialty talent in construction, energy, and health, as well as in our enterprise client group. We expect these new colleagues to season and contribute to organic growth within 12 months to 18 months, which contributes to our mid-single-digit or better organic growth objective. And one final point on revenue. Third quarter fiduciary investment income was up 6% over last year to $85 million. And as a reminder, we do not include fiduciary investment income in our organic revenue growth calculation. Of course, as interest rates decline, we expect an impact on income from fiduciary balances, which average $7.3 billion over the trailing 12 months. For modeling purposes, I'll remind you that a 100 basis point impact on rates has a full year impact of approximately $70 million on investment income. As interest rates decline, lower investment income does lower our margins. However, we still expect to drive adjusted operating margin expansion. Additionally, I'll point out that the earnings impact is partially offset by lower interest expense on our term loan debt. The strength of our business model and our outlook for top and bottom-line growth underpins our expectations that we will deliver double-digit free cash flow growth, irrespective of interest rate movements. On Slide 10, operating income was up 28% to $915 million. Adjusted operating margins were 24.6% in the third quarter and 30.8% year-to-date. For the quarter, margins were up 30 basis points. From our combined baseline with NFP, margins expanded 70 basis points in the quarter and year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin continued to benefit from the scale in our business, particularly in Aon Business Services or ABS, our continued portfolio management shift to higher margin businesses, as well as ongoing expense discipline, and importantly, the benefit from our restructuring initiative to accelerate our 3x3 Plan. Specifically, restructuring savings in the third quarter were $25 million, resulting in $70 million year-to-date savings and 70 basis points of contribution to adjusted operating margins. Looking ahead, we continue to expect $100 million of savings in 2024 and are well on track to achieve our stated goal of $350 million of run rate savings in 2026. Additionally, the momentum in ABS gives us confidence in continued margin expansion over the long-term, as we standardize our operations and integrate our platforms. We remain committed to driving full year adjusted operating margin expansion in 2024 and over the long-term from the NFP adjusted 2023 baseline of 30.6%. Moving to interest, other income and taxes on Slide 11. Interest expense of $213 million was up $94 million versus last year, reflecting $7 billion in higher debt driven by the NFP acquisition. We expect $210 million of interest expense in Q4. Other income was $54 million higher year-over-year, as we divested non-core personal lines in real estate advisory assets. The result of our continued focus on portfolio management was a higher growth and higher margin portfolio. And finally, the Q3 tax rate was 18% with year-over-year increase driven by growth in higher tax geographies, the unfavorable impact of discrete items, and policy changes across the globe. As we look forward, we expect to provide further color on 2025 tax rates during our year-end earnings call. Turning now to free cash flow. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow year-to-date, reflecting strong operating income growth and continued working capital improvements. Our free cash flow is being impacted by extraordinary items, including NFP transaction and integration charges, restructuring and legal settlement expenses we previously communicated. We have line of sight on these items and remain confident in underlying free cash flow growth. We continue to expect a double-digit three-year CAGR on free cash flow from 2023 to 2026. And given our expectations on free cash flow, we are well-positioned to pay down $2.1 billion in debt in 2024. As we look forward, we continue to have confidence and our ability to reduce our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio from 3.9 times to 2.8 times to 3 times in Q4 2025. I'll also highlight that through the first nine months of the year, we have returned $1.2 billion in capital to shareholders through the dividend and $800 million in share repurchases. We continue to estimate approximately $1 billion in share repurchases for 2024. I'll end my prepared remarks on Slide 13 with guidance and some concluding thoughts. With 7% organic growth and continued margin expansion, the third quarter reflects continued momentum in our business. We are executing on our 3x3 Plan and are pleased to see that execution come through in our results. We are reaffirming our full year guidance for 2024, including mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion above our 2023, 30.6% baseline, $100 million of savings in 2024 from our restructuring initiative, all contributing to double-digit free cash flow growth over 2023 to 2026. Additionally, the investments that we're making to hire in priority areas highlights the strength of our financial model and our ability to balance sustainable organic growth, with growth investments, while driving margin expansion and generating double-digit free cash flow growth over the long-term. This financial model gives us confidence in meeting our 2024 to 2026 objectives and in driving sustainable long-term growth. My prepared remarks gives you a sense of why I'm excited to be the CFO of Aon, working with my 60,000 colleagues to build on Aon's long track record of performance. We have a clear strategy for growth. We are executing on that strategy in making the investments in ABS and middle market and priority hires to sustain that growth on both the top and the bottom-line. And as you can see in our 2024 third quarter and year-to-date results, that execution is driving strong performance. So with that, let's jump into your questions. Melissa, I'll turn it back to you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Kligerman: Hi, good morning. So very exciting to see the growth in Commercial Risk Solutions. And Edmund mentioned that you brought in talent in construction, energy, health, enterprise. So maybe you could give a little color on those hirings. Are these high-level producers? Any sense of -- are they a net add to your producer staffing? And is there more to go in terms of hiring and net positive hiring?
Greg Case: Andrew, really appreciate the question. And listen, as we step back and think about the 3x3 Plan and all that we've done to put this in place with risk capital, human capital and the support of Aon Business Services, again delivered through an enterprise approach, we took a moment to really step back and say where can we add content and capability from a leadership standpoint that could truly be additive. And we saw opportunities, as Edmund described very well, in construction and energy and health and enterprise and a few other selected areas, very focused. And we've been very fortunate bringing in some great talent. We'll continue to do that. It will develop over time, as we described. And over the next 12 months to 18 months, we'll see it really start to show up in results. But it is really been a terrific add in some priority areas. But Eric, do you want to talk more specifically about some of these leaders?
Eric Andersen: Yes, sure Greg. I would say just picking up on your commentary there, certainly the ability to draw talent that exists in the industry over to our firm, a lot of it has to do with the investment in analytics and tools that give these client leaders an opportunity to do more with their clients. So as you said, we are going to continue to make those investments in those priority areas where we see an opportunity to deliver real value to our clients. I also, though don't want to lose the point about the inorganic investment in talent that we're making. Certainly, the addition of NFP with their 8,000 colleagues drive a significant volume of relationships in the marketplace. That really is the underpinning of this independent and connected strategy where we're trying to provide more capability specialty expertise like our construction capability or our health care capability or et cetera to those client bases. So you're seeing both organic hiring, you've seen inorganic hiring. And by the way, not just in the US, we talk a lot about NFP, but certainly acquisition we did in France in the health space, it also gives us more capability there too. So we are really excited about the new addition of talent. It merges well with our existing talent base, and really excited about what the opportunity is for us in the future.
Edmund Reese: And Andrew, the only thing I'd add to what Eric just said is, I think you know well, it takes some time for those priority hires to season. We think 12 months to 18 months before you start to reach the peak levels of revenue. But we're comfortable, when we look at the growth in these lines that Eric just mentioned, we're comfortable with the talent is at the quality level and contributing. But overall, that will contribute to our mid-single-digit or greater top-line growth level. So we continue to focus on this as a priority area for us.
Andrew Kligerman: Yes, that's really compelling. And also, as I look at Health Solutions, and you called out double-digit growth in EMEA, Asia, the Pacific and Latin America is -- are these markets just not as mature for Aon? Is this a big opportunity that we can expect to continue potentially even double-digit growth in the out years?
Greg Case: Listen, again Andrew, this is an area we talked about before, which is a category we love. Health, when you think about it overall, is just an area of demand where clients are facing more and more every day. And it is true across all geographies. We've got uniquely strong positions across the world, and you are seeing that reflected. And I would emphasize the investment that Eric described before and then Edmund described in his comments around Aon Business Services, these analyzers, this capability means that our colleagues can be more effective in what they do every day on behalf of clients. Even the priority hires as they come in, this is not about numbers for us, it's about quality and capability. And so we've got the leaders sort of in region, very locally, local understanding, plus a global capability they can bring to bear with these analytics. And that's why we see a space with high demand, and we have great capability to address it, which is why we see a lot of opportunity here.
Eric Andersen: Hi Greg, I would just pile in on that, a couple of quick thoughts. One is we're continuing to win the logos globally, as clients sort of come to us looking for health. And just to go back to the question around outside the US, listen, there is growth around the US, we'd say, in two or three different buckets. One is within some of these countries where there is nationalized health, think about the UK or the Netherlands. Those systems are under pretty significant financial pressure, and you are seeing nascent private markets form. And so that creates a lot of need for insight around analytics, around program construction, et cetera. You're also seeing this global benefit wave where clients are trying to understand their global spend as they take care of their colleagues around the world and really looking to link together their strategy rather than just do it country by country by country. And so you've got, certainly at the upper end of the segment, these global clients that are trying to get a handle on everything and what they're spending around the world, but you've also got specific markets outside the US. But if I start with the nationalized health, you see [nascent] (ph) forming private markets, which actually allow us to give clients really good insight as to strategies to help them execute for their own colleagues within countries.
Edmund Reese: Yes. And I did call out the international markets, Andrew, because I think as you think across international or the different solutions that we have, health is a fast-growing opportunity for us, and we are taking advantage of, as Eric just talked about. The diversity in our business is something that gives us confidence in the mid-single digit or greater growth level. So you might see some solutions or markets growing at higher levels than the others. And it's that diversity that I think gives us confidence in the long-term sustainability of growing at those levels.
Andrew Kligerman : Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Scott: Hi, good morning. First one I had is on free cash flow. It looks like some of the growth progress was coming in quicker than we would have expected. And I just wanted to see, is there anything abnormal in there or anything we should think about timing-wise at an end to the -- end of the year?
Edmund Reese: Free cash flow is coming right in-line with what we've expected. Like the first thing to think about is our objective, and we think we are right on track to be at a double-digit level when we think about our $3.2 billion in 2023, where we expect to end in 2026. We know this year, it's being impacted by [two or three] (ph), I called out extraordinary items, the NFP integration costs, the legal settlement costs impacting it, and the restructuring charges part of Aon United. There could be some quarterly timing and movement in those numbers between quarters, but you know we run this company as an annual company. And when I think about it on a full year basis, is right in-line with what we expected. And most importantly, that's the thing that gives us confidence in being able to pay down the debt and to continue to have the type of capital return to both the dividends and the very important share repurchases that we've committed to for the year. So nothing out of the ordinary from our expectations on that.
Alex Scott: Got it. And then the other thing I wanted to ask about is net new business. I mean that sounded like a pretty strong result. Can you talk about some of the places you've seen the most success there if we kind of dive down into the different businesses?
Eric Andersen: Sure. Why don't I take a shot at that one, guys? Listen, I would say in the priority hiring areas, there is a reason why they're our priority hiring areas. There's a lot of activity in that space, whether it's in construction or health care. And we are seeing that across the globe, so it's not just in sort of North America. I would say, if you step back and look across the segments, certainly, the enterprise client space, which are our largest global clients, as they think about dealing with some of these big trends that are out there around whether in climate, around trade, around technology, around workforce, their needs are complicated. And so our ability to bring our analytics, we talk a lot about these analyzers and give them real insight, has really led to the opportunity to do more with them. So it is both existing clients doing more with them as well as new clients that are new to the firm. But we're seeing it in priority areas, we're seeing it across the segments, and we're seeing it across the globe. So it was really a strong quarter for us all the way around.
Edmund Reese: And I would characterize it, when you look at the history Alex, I'd characterize that as a normal course of business for us to drive 10 points of growth from net new business and continue to have that strong retention. Those are the levers that drives the growth for Aon here. So nothing new, and as Eric just said, we are seeing it across these different segments, in different countries. I think that will continue to be the key driver of growth for us on the top-line.
Alex Scott: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was on just the M&A and SPAC activity. I know you guys called out that there was double-digit growth within that business in Commercial Risk in the quarter. Where are we -- I guess, compared to peak levels? And as those markets start to rebound, do you have a sense of how that could incrementally benefit commercial risk from here?
Greg Case: Elyse, appreciate the question. Just to start, just for context overall, as we said before, we love this space, the space we developed over time. We continue to invest behind, it is got a lot of derivative connections, and we've really developed it in the downturn. I would just, for context, just to remind M&A volume, as you've heard on the investment banking calls, by the way is still 13% below the 10-year average year-to-date. By the way, that is better than it was last year, which was much, much worse than that. So it is come back a bit, you're starting to see that show up. Edmund described that very, very well. But over time, the dry powder out there, as we all know is substantial. And so our view is this will be an area of real client value that we can deliver. And as such, will show up across our -- across commercial risk for us in a very positive way. But even beyond that, in the other solution lines as well, because a lot of things get connected with M&A activity. So overall where we've made progress as Edmund described very well, and we expect it to continue over time.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question is on tax. Edmund, I know you said that you would get into the 2025 tax discussion on the year-end call. But can you just help us think through the positive and negative factors, I guess that you're considering relative to tax and as you kind of think about the update that you're going to give us in a few months?
Edmund Reese: Yes. Look the first thing that I'd call out here Elyse, is the fact that there is variability quarter-to-quarter. When you have a rate that's 21% -- 22% in Q1 and Q2 and then 18% in Q3, it gives you some sense of why we are very cautious about the exact guidance that we give on this item, because there is variability in the quarter. Recently, I don't think the items that impacted year-over-year for us have changed. Before my time and even now, we see the growth in the higher tax geographies is one driver of what happens to the tax rates, two policy changes certainly are happening across the globe in different geographies right now. In this particular quarter, to answer your question specifically, in this particular quarter, there was a positive discrete item last year during this time. That has an impact on the tax rate in Q3 here as well. I think the key point from my perspective is we have a tax rate that allows us to invest in the business. And when we finalize – we’ll finalize fiscal year ‘24 over the next couple of months here, you’ll get insight on that, and we’ll give more insight on 2025 as we get into the Q4 call, both on the baseline tax and any discrete items that we’re aware of at that time.
Elyse Greenspan : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Michael Zaremski: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the color on unpacking some of the high-level components of the 7% organic. Just curious would you be able or willing to kind of share as this organic growth has accelerated a bit year-to-date? Has it come more so from the new business 10 points or from exposure maybe was lower than 2 points previously? Or I kind of assume the retention -- I think I'm -- if I do the math, I'm backing to 95%, that's kind of more stable, but I could be wrong. Any color there would be helpful.
Edmund Reese: I mean you have it exactly right. I mean you have it exactly right. Mike, that 5 points -- that means you backed into the right number on retention. The growth is coming from existing -- from new business from existing clients selling more solutions, as Eric was just talking about earlier, and adding new logos. And adding new logos. So new business from that. Offset by strong retention above 90%, and it was strong in Q3 and the levels that you're talking about are largely on. The market impact is the thing that we control less of, the rate impact and the pricing. And that was only 2 points -- it was a 2-point contribution to the net new business to get us to that 7 points overall. So again, I think that's in-line with what the history has been. And what we expect is our efforts are the drivers of growth moving forward here.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Got it. That 2 points isn't too meaningfully different than the kind of historical. Okay. Got it.
Edmund Reese: Yes. That's in-line.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. And maybe just switching gears, curious on the NFP acquisition, clearly going well. At the time of the deal was announced, you did talk about a potential for some fairly material revenue synergies. I think in some investors' minds, revenue synergies are a lot of hard work. Just curious if you think you'll be updating us on those going forward? Or any comments you'd like to make about revenue synergies from the deal?
Edmund Reese: It’s a great question because it's clearly a focus of ours. It's clearly a focus of ours, for sure. Five months in Q3, the performance right in-line with or better than the business case, and mid-single digit in the quarter, accretive to Commercial, accretive to Wealth. As I think about the four financial objectives that we put out there, revenue synergies and OpEx was one of them. And Eric can jump in here, but we talk about the cross-sell that's going to NFP and coming from NFP, I feel very good about our expectations of $175 million in 2026 on the OpEx synergies of $60 million by 2026 as well. I talked about in line or better, and what I'd point to there is the EPS accretion as we think about 2025. We talked about it being neutral during that time. And I'd say, we're tracking to be better than that. So we'll definitely give updates on those numbers as well as the free cash flow and the M&A performance that's happening in NFP as well. But Eric, I don't know if you want to add any color on the [Technical Difficulty].
Eric Andersen: Sure, yes. Let me add a little bit of color on it. I think the -- so a couple of ways I would approach this, the independent and connected philosophy when we -- sort of we're talking to NFP about the opportunity to become part of Aon was really about using those 8,000 people we talked about on a talent question around how we can actually deliver more capability for each other. And we are really seeing, whether it's an NFP client relationship that needs additional subject matter expertise, whether it is trade credit or transaction services or D&O or what have you or the CyQu example that Greg used. So the ability to partner relationships and expertise where we've already got a business relationship, we are really seeing that gather momentum. And that's just on the risk side. On the Health side, it's very similar our health analyzer being able to bring tools to their clients, being able to bring the pharmacy benefit, being able to bring the global connectivity. So we also were very conservative in how we look at revenue synergies, recognizing that those are really hard to pull off. But we thought that with this independent and connected strategy, our ability to actually bring that capability together, it is an education process, and I think as Edmund said, we're five months into this. And our ability to sort of showcase Aon capability, understand NFP relationships and really begin to work together towards driving sort of client value. One of our hypotheses going into this was the mid-market segment is more risky and more complicated across risk, health and wealth. And our ability to bring that talent into that segment in a way that that segment can digest and use it was one of the key aspects of why we wanted to partner up with NFP. And so I do think that opportunity is starting to bear fruit for us as we go down the road. And then the other piece I would offer is certainly our ability, when we go into the marketplace, whether it's commission rate standardization, how we actually bring all of the premium volume on the risk side into the market, has also -- is a concrete example of how sort of two are better than one in that example.
Greg Case: And sorry, not to pile on with NFP just given the progress that the teams have made jointly, but listen fundamentally, this is demand. We saw huge demand and opportunity in the middle market, of all the issues that Eric just described, and our ability to actually bring content through what is an incredibly strong set of client relationships that NFP brings to the table. They're really exceptional. And that's really the combination. The last piece I just would highlight, and we mentioned it in the opening comments, is not just in the day-to-day business as it currently exists. If you think about the M&A pipeline, independent and connected has real meaningful value there in terms of all the operating flexibility that we are describing in independent and connected with additional capability. And that's also actually showing up in talent and hires who want to come be part of it. So as Edmund said, it's five months. We run everything a piece at a time, a step at a time. But it’s really been a good start to the process, and we’re more excited than ever.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. First, just had a question on organic growth and the contribution of NFP. I think, Greg, you mentioned that growth would have been consistent with NFP. I think you said the same thing last quarter as well, which I guess is a positive for your legacy business. But I would have assumed with the economic economy being fairly strong and then NFP being part of a larger organization, that that business would be growing a little bit faster. But maybe you could sort of unpack that for us.
Edmund Reese: I think it's -- Greg, you should pile on, but I think it simply comes back to we're five months in. As the revenue synergies come to fruition, what you'll have is the baseline growth, which I think is strong at mid-single-digit levels, in-line with what we have at Aon, which is what you are referencing from Greg's earlier comments, as the revenue synergies start to come through, I think you'll see higher levels of growth. And as the acquisition, we had an objective of $50 million to $60 million in earnings and EBITDA from the acquisition that NFP does, as that comes online as well, that will accelerate revenue growth as well. So it's those -- I think about it in those three components. The baseline growth would come from revenue synergies and then would come from the acquisition as well. And that's what we feel like we are right on track to be able to deliver.
Greg Case: I don't know, Jimmy, listen, we -- again, a quarter of progress, meaningful progress. We just posted for the overall Aon firm 7% organic growth. [7%] (ph). That's improvement and progression throughout the year. And so that's [7%] (ph). And as you know, NFP is 5 months in, and it's an important but relatively smaller part obviously, that's driven by core Aon, and then it was accretive with NFP. So from our standpoint, this is a really good formula. But you start, as you described with the strength of Aon, the fundamental strength of Aon across all solution lines, and then we add the capabilities that Edmund and Eric have just described. So again, we are feeling very good about progression and really reinforcing the thesis, mid-single-digit or greater, improved margins and double-digit free cash flow growth over the long-term. So for us, you just saw a quarter of progress and then you saw NFP additive to that thesis.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just following up on margins. You've had steady margin expansion over time. How should we think about like margins improving going forward, especially if fiduciary investment income becomes a headwind? There is an offset you mentioned from lower floating rate debt. But should we assume that margin expansion would slow, or like would you control discretionary spending or other items as well?
Edmund Reese: Well, I think the short answer to the question is that we expect continued margin expansion here, but I'll actually start with the point that you made as well, which is we have this long history of margin expansion. I think there was a page in the release that showed, over the last decade, 100 basis points of margin expansion. That has continued in the Q3 and year-to-date with 70 -- at 70 basis points for both of those time periods. That piece is largely driven after you net everything in and out. That's largely driven by the restructuring that we have. But we think it will continue moving forward because primarily of ABS, number one, the scale that we get in that business, as we said earlier, standardize the operations and integrate the platforms, number one. There is a long runway to drive margin expansion from that. But also the portfolio management that we have, we are active with that. That continues to drive margin expansion for us. And then just the continued expense discipline. Fiduciary investment income call it, less than 20 basis points is our estimate this year in terms of its contribution to margin expansion. It is one of the levers that we use to create investment capacity and drive margin expansion. So we think, despite that sort of going away, that we'll continue to be able to have it. And for us, it really isn't margin expansion for the sake of margin expansion. What we want to do is create investment capacity to invest in ABS, to invest in the priority hires that Eric was just talking about earlier. And we think our financial model allows us to create that capacity and still deliver margin expansion, which allows us to drive the double-digit free cash flow that we're focused on.
Greg Case: Just a punchline on that, Jimmy, listen, again, Edmund's point last 12 years, we've done 100 basis points a year, last 12 years, a year. And there were times there was zero fiduciary income, zero sort of in the context of that. And we didn't have risk capital. We didn't have human capital in its current construct. We didn't have Aon Business Services, nor was Enterprise Client at the state it's in, nor had we invested and been in the process as we are with a 3x3 Plan over '24, '25 and '26 of investing $1 billion into strengthening and accelerating that. So for us, we think there is lots of momentum, but lots more to come that shows up top-line and margin. And again, as we reflect on margin, it is not a zero-sum game. When we add more value to clients, we add more capability to clients, we're creating more value. And so in the context of that, our view is we have the capacity to invest back into the business, as Edmund described, and the capacity to improve margin from an operating and an efficiency standpoint. And you are seeing that play out exactly as we had intended. And we have a long way to go, and we're excited about so far the distance traveled, but we are looking forward to building momentum through our 3x3 Plan and exiting 2026 with even more momentum than we had coming in.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Grace Carter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Grace Carter: Hi everyone. I think you all said that NFP was accretive to organic growth in Commercial Risk and Wealth this quarter. I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, but would it be possible to quantify that impact?
Edmund Reese: Good morning Grace, first of all. Yes look, I think it is important just to start with the fact that it is a new acquisition, and I appreciate the fact that folks want to parse out that business. It's important though for us that we think about our overall Aon United strategy, we intend to include that in our solution – it is included in our solution line numbers and our overall growth. Since it is early, we are parsing it out right now. And it added less than [50] (ph) basis points than any of the solutions that we -- in terms of contribution to any of the solution growth that we've had. Again, it was positive to Commercial Risk, it was positive accretion to Wealth, with still strong single-digit growth and mid-single digit growth in Health as well. So we feel very good about the performance thus far. I think that’s what --.
Eric Andersen: Hey, Edmund, maybe one pile on comment on this one, is that when we went into this with the independent and connected model, the idea was not to spend a whole lot of time figuring out what bucket does the revenue fall in. So when we work on a client opportunity with an NFP producer and an Aon capability, we are not really focused on whether X belongs in NFP or Y belongs in Aon. And so the opportunity to kind of keep it separate, we really didn't want to do that because we felt that culturally and business opportunity-wise, it was more important to focus on just bring the capability, win the business, do the client work. And so the ability to kind of really parse it that way becomes more difficult over time as the teams really connect.
Grace Carter: Thank you. And I guess, looking at Health and Wealth could you remind us of the mix of offerings in those segments that might fall under the discretionary bucket versus the more defensive bucket and whether the addition of NFP has noticeably impacted that mix going forward or not?
Greg Case: Yes, I'll start and then Eric can add a couple of pieces of color commentary here as well. Listen, overall, this business on the Health side and on the Wealth side, like our Commercial Risk business and our reinsurance business as well, are very high retention businesses. And it really is universal across the board. There are certainly discrete areas where we provide advice on a project basis, but net-net, these are very, very retentive businesses across the board. And you've seen us benefit from that. And especially in areas like in Health where we are adding new logos -- we add new logos, we keep new logos for a long time. But our ability to add them over the last 18 months has been exceptional. So the characteristics here are absolutely fantastic. Demand profile is very, very good, and retention exceptional.
Eric Andersen: Yes, Greg, maybe the only thing I would add, when you think about the Wealth business, in particular, with the pension actuarial work around defined benefit plans, that work has to happen each year and there is significant regulatory change that does create bespoke projects as time goes by. Those theoretically could be discretionary, but with the regulatory changes that continue to happen, whether it is global minimum pensions in the UK, similar work in the Netherlands, some work in the US, or as the rules change and the plans themselves have to adapt to them, it just creates project work that does seemingly recur each year. And then maybe on the Health side, Greg, you said it well. I think the core health and benefit offering, whether in the pharmacy work and even the talent work around salary transparency, there is just a lot of regulatory framework work that creates opportunity for us that theoretically is discretionary, but honestly, as it happens each year, it tends to repeat.
Greg Case: And then you asked about NFP, and I would highlight is this is a group, as Eric said, 8,000 colleagues who come to be part of Aon, I'm so excited to have them, but they bring great client relationships and extraordinary content and insight in health and benefits, and in wealth, so on both pieces. It is not just accretive performance, it is accretive content, and it is really going both ways. We're bringing content to NFP and NFP back to Aon. So a positive from our perspective.
Grace Carter: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
David Motemaden: Thanks good morning. Edmund, I think you mentioned that you guys have acquired $26 million in terms of EBITDA through the middle-market. So that's a little bit below the $45 million to $60 million that you guys have targeted for the year. Could you just comment on the achievability of that target?
Edmund Reese: I was mentioning to the team earlier I'm so close to the NFP corporate development team over there, I am more worried about us going over the number in terms of spending and capital deployment than coming under the number right now. The pipeline is rich. And hopefully you picked up on Eric's comment, and maybe you should emphasize it, Eric, this independent and connected strategy and how it really is attractive to others out there, and the market is driving a big pipeline of opportunities. So $26 million in EBITDA year-to-date, when I look at that pipeline -- and whether it all happens in 2024, which I think we're confident in, or some spills over into 2025, I think we're right in-line with the objectives that we have on the M&A front.
David Motemaden: Great. That's helpful. And then Edmund, really appreciate the detail you gave in terms of net new as well as the market impact for the total company. Is there any way you could share that same detail for the commercial risk segment specifically?
Edmund Reese: The thing about it -- look, we're -- you heard me mention in the beginning of my comments that we'll think about sharing more information as we move forward. So we'll see exactly what it is. The numbers are actually quite similar when you look across our solution lines in terms of contribution from net new business and retention together, from new business and retention together versus market impact, except in the areas with -- like Wealth or Health where there is this piece that Eric was just talking about where there's advisory, the opportunity to be able to articulate value and drive benefit that our customers find valuable, and we change sort of the composition of that growth. Outside of that, it is quite similar across the different solution lines. And we are working through exactly what we’re able to share and disclose moving forward on that.
David Motemaden : Great. Thanks looking forward to it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dean Criscitiello with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Dean Criscitiello: You guys noted that aggregate pricing was flat this quarter, but I was curious if that -- were there any differences between the middle market and larger accounts? And if you guys had any assumptions going forward on pricing.
Eric Andersen: Why don't I take that one, guys? Listen, I think -- and I think I've said it before, but I think it is always worth sort of saying where the pricing actually fits into the work that we do. So we first start with our clients around how do we actually identify and help them understand what risk they have in the business. And then we actually think through with them, what are your options to manage the risk, whether it is to finance it yourself, whether it's to use captives that we've talked about in the past. And then ultimately, if you decide to transfer the volatility, how are you going to do that? And as you sort of ask with the segments, I would say there is multiple markets out there, whether it is -- if the question was US or whether it is outside the US and Latin America, in Europe and Asia, et cetera. And then there is industry bent and then there is segment bent. So you get a variety of different market approaches based on what the risks are of the individual clients. But if I were to bucket it for you, I would say, on a property basis, I’d say, for those clients that deserve to see premium decreases based on their risk exposure, we are seeing that happen, and we continue to expect that. I think casualty, especially in North America, and this is up and down the segment, continues to see pressure, whether it is because of increased loss cost, social inflation, things that you know well about, is driving pricing increases and a sort of restriction of appetite from the insurers. And then there is sort of bucket called specialty casualty between D&O, cyber that type of thing. We're continuing to see a surplus of capital that's in that space, and so opportunities for clients to really obtain some premium relief for their different risks. But listen, there is ultimately capital in all the segments. And so we do see an opportunity for clients, whether you are a small client, a midsized client or a large client, to actually be able to make some buying choices based on surplus capital in some of the key areas.
Dean Criscitiello: Thank you for that. And then my follow-up, I was curious as to the lower interest rates than the expectation for additional interest rate cuts have any implications on the growth outlook in either the Health or the Wealth segment.
Edmund Reese: I think the big impact that we expect to experience from interest rate impact is on the fiduciary investment income line. And as I said in my prepared remarks, illustratively about 100 basis points has approximately a $70 million impact on that business. Of course, you need to think about the growth in those balances. You think about the lower expense that we have because of our term-loan debt, as well as we need to think about where the currencies are located, less than 60% are in the US and then they're in euro and GBP. That's the biggest impact on our business. And as I said earlier, we still expect to be able to hit our objectives across the firm, across each of our solution lines despite the interest rate environment. So that's what I'd call out to you.
Dean Criscitiello : Got it. Thank you.
Greg Case: Think about the overall profile as it relates to Health and Wealth. Listen, this opportunity is fundamentally unlimited on the Health side. This has gone up. This is health care inflation. And this is projected to be up 9%, 10% again in '25, is unbelievably challenged profile for our clients, and that really is the demand driver on the Health side. And similar on the Wealth side, if we think about pension risk transfer, and some of the other things that come, the changing rate environments, the demand in both categories, both solution lines, is exceptionally strong.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Cox: Hi, thanks. First question I had on reinsurance brokerage. Some of your peers have said that the market might be centering on more muted property cat reinsurance pricing changes into next year. And I'm not sure what your view is on reinsurance demand growth, but I know it was quite strong this year. So I'm curious how conducive you think the reinsurance brokerage environment might be into 2025.
Eric Andersen: Great question. I expected somebody was going to ask us that question at some point. Listen, maybe I will just open with an overarching thought that the reinsurance market is constructed to handle events like Helene and Milton. That is why it exists. It is doing great work. There's money flowing into the area for reconstruction. So it is all good on that front. I will say that, as we were going into the fall, you definitely had pressure from clients, which I think was rightly applied, around pricing and around attachment points based on the way the market had moved over the last three years, where there were significant program changes as reinsurers sort of changed their position. Certainly, post these two events, there is conversations that are happening around, does it flatten the pricing, does it slow the rate of the sand, however you want to phrase it. And I would say, it is early. There is still substantial capital that's in the marketplace. And I would say that, depending on where you sit in the world certainly, the Europeans are pushing hard for price decreases and attachment point relief based on where they sit. And I think as these negotiations take firmer sort of structure, over the next 8 weeks to 10 weeks, I think you're going to see clients continue to push either for rate or for attachment point relief going forward. And we'll see where it turns out. And I look forward to talking to you about it the next time we're together.
Robert Cox: That's really helpful. If I could follow up with a question on cat bonds. I appreciate you guys putting the 13% growth in cat bond issuance year-to-date in the press release. Could you help us think about the economics to Aon of cap on placement versus traditional reinsurance brokerage?
Eric Andersen: Thanks. So listen, those bonds -- let me take a step up for a second. In the end, our goal here is to get paid for value, for what we deliver for clients, whether it's in the form of a reinsurance brokerage, whether it's in the form of cat bonds. These are very sophisticated clients and we have very sophisticated discussions around what our value proposition is in the structure. So we are agnostic to the tool that they use, because they each have a role in their capital stack in terms of there are certain risks that belong in the capital markets, there are certain risks that belong in the reinsurance market. And our goal is to help the clients figure out which one it does. So for us, we are agnostic to whether it's cat bond, whether it is a traditional reinsurance placement. But rest assured, the conversation with each of the clients around our value for what we're doing for them is very open and transparent. And so for us, it doesn't really matter which way it goes because, ultimately we are just trying to provide the right level of value to our clients.
Robert Cox: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Case for any closing comments.
Greg Case: Just want to say thanks for joining us and we look forward to our call next time. And again, have a great day, and I appreciate you being part of the call today.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2024 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. Additionally, we're delighted to be joined by Edmund Reese, who will succeed Christa as CFO on July 29. On our call today, Christa and I will provide our usual prepared remarks, and Edmund will highlight a few initial observations before he officially steps in to report Q3. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We begin by thanking our colleagues around the world, including the 7,700 colleagues we welcome from NFP for the great work they do to deliver for clients, on each of the three pillars of our 3x3 plan, delivering Risk Capital and Human Capital solutions through our Aon Client Leadership Model scaled by the Aon Business Services platform. Let's now turn to Edmund. Edmund, on behalf of Global Aon, we're thrilled to have you on our team and your first day on Investor Call as you officially step into the CFO role on Monday. Welcome.
Edmund Reese: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm incredibly excited to be here. First, I want to start by thanking my Aon colleagues for their very warm welcome. I've connected with literally hundreds of colleagues over the last month. And it's been great to meet everyone and really experience the energy and the enthusiasm of Aon, and the commitment to deliver on our plans. What's been most exciting for me is seeing firsthand the investment in the corresponding growth opportunity for our clients, colleagues and shareholders as we deliver on a 3x3 plan over 2024, '25 and '26. And I have to say that with the 3x3 fully in place in '26 and the building momentum, equally compelling is the significant opportunity that will deliver value creation beyond '26 and over the long-term. Finally, the financial model is strong, and the company is performing and well positioned to continue to deliver long-term double-digit free cash flow growth. I also want to add that I'm looking forward to meeting investors and the sell-side in talking through how we will deliver on our guidance and continue to allocate and invest their capital with discipline, focused on high-return investments and capital return and, of course, reporting our third quarter results and fielding questions at that time. So Greg back to you.
Greg Case: Thanks, Edmund, and we're very excited to have you here. Before speaking to results in detail, we want to highlight a great example of the power of a united firm to deliver solutions where they're needed greatly. In Ukraine, until last month, there was no functioning war risk insurance market because carriers couldn't get reinsurance coverage due to standing war exclusions. Working with the US and Ukranian governments, we created a solution that provides insurance and reinsurance capital to Ukrainian insurers, which has already brought in $350 million of new capital, encompassing a first-of-its-kind structure that facilitates new investments and economic recovery. This structure enables rebuilding and economic activity during the war and much more rapid investment in reconstruction and resilience longer term. This product couldn't have been created without global connectivity, expertise, data and analytics, on-the-ground relationships and local market knowledge and our proven ability to match risk and capital across private and public sectors. This innovative structure helps protect and grow the economy and helps the people of Ukraine recover and rebuild. It's a compelling example of the positive impact that our industry can have in addressing major challenges in the global economy. Turning now to current quarter results. In Q2, our team delivered 6% total organic revenue growth with all solution lines at 6% or greater, and both Aon and NFP delivering mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. For clarification and transparency, the 6% organic performance for Aon is 6% without NFP. With this organic growth, in the addition of NFP, we delivered 18% total revenue growth, 19% adjusted operating income growth and margins of 27.4%, an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points from our combined 2023 margin baseline, including only two months of NFP. Year-to-date, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth, 11% total revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion, contributing to 12% adjusted operating income growth and 7% growth in earnings per share. Turning to our solution lines. In Commercial Risk, organic revenue growth of 6% reflects double-digit growth in EMEA and LatAm, with strong growth in North America, driven by net new business growth and strong retention. On average, we saw growth in exposures and generally flat pricing, resulting in moderately positive market impact. And while we're starting to see the turnaround in external capital markets, our M&A services business had modest positive impact in the quarter, although the available pipeline remains strong and growing. For NFP, growth for the two months was consistent with our North American business. Overall, a strong result. Finally, we're making great progress on priority talent acquisitions with continuing focus in this area and expect these new colleagues to contribute to further growth over time. Turning to Reinsurance. 7% organic revenue growth in Q2 reflects strong growth in treaty, with strength internationally in LatAm, EMEA and APAC. We saw increased capacity in the US property CAT space, which provides ongoing opportunity for our clients to increase and optimize their coverage supported by our team's leading expertise, data analytics and insight. Health Solutions delivered 6% organic revenue growth with high-single-digit growth globally in core health and benefits and real strength in consumer-facing and executive benefits, driven by new business wins. The market environment reflects an increased health care cost trend and positive impact from enrollment levels. NFP's contribution was consistent with Aon's performance, an impressive result in the midst of the closing. And finally, Wealth Solutions organic revenue growth was 9%, an outstanding result, reflecting ongoing strength in pension derisking and core retirement. NFP also delivered strong growth, driven by asset inflows and market performance. Overall, we're pleased with both the top and bottom line growth in the quarter as we continue to deliver against our 3x3 plan on all fronts. Further, after only two months of NFP, early progress is fully on track or ahead of expectations. Four key growth and value creation opportunities highlight this strong start. First, on independent and connected, outlining how we're bringing NFP into Aon. Our teams are coming together with a shared vision and client-first mindset, and they're building connectivity across Aon and NFP. Our early close is increasing momentum as we work together to deliver wins and bring the best from Aon and NFP to our clients. Second, top line growth. We're seeing strong organic revenue growth from NFP. And though early, we're on track to deliver our revenue synergy commitments, noting that we modeled zero net impact in 2024 and have seen strong client and colleague retention. Third, NFP's M&A engine is operating exceptionally well and the pipeline remains very strong. We've completed 14 deals so far in 2024 at attractive multiples weighted toward commercial risk and health. And we're finding that our independent and connected value proposition is distinctive and highly attractive. And fourth, bottom line growth. We're on track to fully deliver in line with guidance on all aspects of the combination through efficiencies, cost synergies and free cash flow impact, leveraging operational best practices from Aon Business Services. In summary, our Q2 and year-to-date results demonstrate progress against our financial guidance and our 3x3 plan, which will deliver superior content and capability across Risk Capital and Human Capital through Aon Client Leadership, ensuring we bring relevant client solutions all the time, all enabled through Aon Business Services. This performance will deliver compelling long-term value creation for clients, colleagues and shareholders. Before I turn to Christa for one final time, I want to take a moment to thank her again for a great partnership, leadership and friendship, and for her inspiring and invaluable commitment to building our firm. Christa, over to you for your thoughts on our financial results and long-term outlook.
Christa Davies: Thank you so much, Greg, and thank you so much for the partnership. My time at Aon was and will continue to be the highlight of my career. I remain incredibly excited about the value creation potential we have ahead of us through the 3x3 plan. I'm thrilled to welcome Edmund, and I look forward to serving as an advisor to the team to support and ensure a smooth transition. Turning now to the quarter. As Greg highlighted, we delivered exceptional results in the second quarter, with 6% organic revenue growth highlighted by 7% in Wealth and 7% in -- sorry, 9% in Wealth and 7% in Reinsurance. Our overall organic revenue growth does not include the impact -- does include the impact of NFP, beginning from April '25 when we closed the acquisition. So we only had two months performance, NFP's Q2 performance was in line with the business case as it delivered mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. NFP also contributed to the 18% total revenue growth in the quarter, which translated into a 19% adjusted operating income growth, margins of 27.4% and 6% adjusted per share -- earnings per share growth. These results position us well to drive progress against all elements of the 3x3 plan, driving results in 2024 and over the long-term. As I reflect on our performance for the first half of the year, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 6% in Q2, driven by net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2024 and over the long-term. As Greg described, we're making excellent progress with NFP. We continue to expect that NFP will contribute to the firm's overall revenue growth through organic revenue growth, including $175 million of net revenue synergies by 2026 and inorganic growth from ongoing M&A. While it's early, we're on track to achieve deal synergies, with no net impact in 2024 from cost and revenue synergies and positive impact in 2025 and 2026. This is exactly in line with the guidance we gave when we announced the deal. It's also worth noting that voluntary colleague attrition at NFP is down year-over-year. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement with adjusted operating margins of 33.8% in the first half, an increase of 20 basis points, driven by revenue growth, portfolio mix shift, efficiencies from Aon Business Services and restructuring savings, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth. If we consider the combined historic margin profile of Aon and NFP, including two-thirds of NFP's results from the second quarter of 2023, adjusted operating margins expanded 60 basis points in Q2 and 80 basis points year-to-date, which is how we think about ongoing margin expansion. We're making meaningful progress on our Aon Business Services strategy, including through our restructuring program, which helps to accelerate our 3x3 plan and contributes to margin expansion through net savings. We continue to streamline and improve operational processes, moving work to the best locations and enhancing colleague and client experience with powerful new tools such as our property, casualty, D&O, cyber and health risk analyzers. Restructuring savings in the second quarter were $25 million, resulting in $45 million of restructuring savings year-to-date and 60 basis points of contribution to adjusted operating margin year-to-date. Restructuring actions completed so far are expected to generate $95 million of savings in 2024. We expect restructuring savings will fall to the bottom line. At this time, we continue to expect $100 million of realized savings in 2024 as we continue to accelerate our plans for Aon Business Services and our business. As we think about adjusted operating margins moving forward, we continue to expect to drive adjusted operating margin expansion over the full year on a combined firm basis and the long-term through ongoing revenue growth, portfolio mix shift to higher revenue growth, higher margin areas of the portfolio, and efficiencies from Aon Business Services. As we previously communicated, we think the right baseline from which to measure 2025 adjusted operating margin growth is 30.6%. Calculated out as 31.6% from 2023, less 100 basis point drag from NFP for the period from the 2020 -- from the April '25 close through the end of 2024. We also expect fiduciary investment income to be relatively flat year-over-year based on current interest rate expectations. So we expect the tailwind we've seen in the first half of the year will be reduced in the back half. So we remain committed to driving full year adjusted operating margin expansion in 2024 and over the long-term against this adjusted baseline of 30.6%. Turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS grew 6% in Q2 and 7% year-to-date, reflecting double-digit adjusted operating income growth and ongoing share buyback, partially offset by higher interest expense, the issuance of 19 million shares to fund the acquisition of NFP and a higher tax rate. Turning now to free cash flow. We generated $721 million of free cash flow year-to-date, reflecting strong operating income growth and lower CapEx, offset by payments related to NFP transaction and integration charges, legal settlement expense, restructuring and higher cash tax payments, as we've previously communicated. As we look forward, our free cash flow outlook remains strong based on our strong expected operating income growth and a $500 million long-term opportunity in working capital. We've communicated that, in the near term, free cash flow will be impacted by restructuring, higher interest expense and NFP deal and integration costs. In 2025 and 2026, NFP is expected to add $300 million and $600 million of incremental free cash flow, respectively, contributing to our overall expectation of long-term double-digit free cash flow growth. We allocate capital based on ROIC and long-term value creation, which we've done through time through core business investment, share buyback and M&A. As we look historically, we have a successful track record of balancing organic investment, acquisitions, divestitures and share buyback as we continue to optimize our portfolio against our priority investment areas on an ROIC basis. Given the very strong long-term free cash flow outlook for the firm, we expect share repurchase will remain our highest ROIC opportunity. We completed $500 million of buyback in the first half and continue to expect share buyback to be substantial at $1 billion or more in 2024 based on our current M&A expectations for the rest of the year. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities that we can scale to address unmet client needs. Regarding M&A. Our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our high priority areas, including the mid-market and attractive geographies that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges, known that we closed an acquisition in France this quarter, bringing new specialist capabilities and health and benefits into Aon. We are also continuing to see success from NFP's impressive M&A engine. Since the beginning of 2024, NFP has completed 14 acquisitions at attractive multiples weighted towards commercial risk and health, representing $36 million in annualized revenue. As we previously communicated, we expect NFP to do M&A comprised of $45 million to $60 million of EBITDA per year, and they are on track for the full year 2024. We look forward to building on their established track record and executing against this strong pipeline to drive future growth in the space and value creation within our ROIC framework. Going forward, we'll continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis, contemplating buyback, M&A and delevering. Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet. As previously communicated, we expect our credit ratios to be elevated over the next 12 to 18 months, as we bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels consistent with our credit profile, driven by substantial free cash flow generation and incremental debt capacity from EBITDA growth, noting our track record of effectively managing leverage within our current ratings. In summary, our strong financial results in the quarter and year-to-date position us well to continue driving progress against all elements of our 3x3 plan and driving results in 2024 and over the long-term. We look forward to building on this momentum. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and Greg, Eric and I'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Before I get into the questions, I just -- also just want to extend my congrats to Christa just on your successful career at Aon.
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Elyse.
Elyse Greenspan: Yes. Thanks, Christa. My first question is on Commercial Risk. I guess it's two parts. Maybe, Greg, you said the overall organic growth wasn't impacted by NFP. Would that statement also hold true for Commercial Risk? And then can you also just expand on what turned in the quarter? You guys went from 3% to 6%, you saw a doubling of growth within that segment in the quarter.
Greg Case: Yes. Maybe I'll start, Elyse, but then important to get Eric's input and Christa's here, too. Listen, first of all, to your first question, yes, we want to be really clear about NFP has been two months. So you take NFP out completely, the 6% and all the solution line results would have been exactly the same without NFP. So that's exactly correct. And think about Commercial Risk, maybe put it in context a little bit. What we're seeing in Commercial Risk is exactly consistent with what you're seeing really across the firm. And you should expect and we expect that we're going to continue to make progress and build momentum in '24, '25 and '26 on the 3x3 plan. And again, this all starts with better understanding the client need and then taking some very specific hard steps to put Aon in a position to address this demand in a way that we think, Elyse, is going to be a better set of solutions and really distinctive and that's really the 3x3 plan, and you know what the elements of that are. And that's what delivered the 6% organic, the margin expansion and the OI growth. In Commercial Risk, specifically, again, even without NFP, 6% growth was driven by real strength in net new business generation and strong retention. And really the strong performance held across all major geographies. And we wouldn't probably get into quarter-to-quarter because the quarters are different. The mix is different between them. As we said in Q1, there were some external factors we saw last quarter that we didn't expect were ever going to repeat and they likely won't repeat, and they didn't repeat. And on average, you step back, you see growth in exposures, generally flat pricing resulting in modestly positive market impact. As we said, M&A services, we're starting to see the turnaround in external capital markets, but really M&A services really had a modest positive impact in the quarter. But our team, look, with the investments we've made and the caliber of that team and the capability are incredibly well positioned to take advantage of the growing and what is available pipeline out there now. And then again, with that said, NFP growth for the two months was consistent and that went into the overall, as Christa described. And I would also say we're making great progress on our priority hire pipeline in areas like energy and construction and expect these new colleagues to contribute to further growth over time. But really, Elyse what we're trying to highlight is Q2 is just a continuation of what we're doing with the 3x3 plan and you're starting to see that really play out and we expect it's going to continue for the rest of the year and then to '25 and '26 and beyond. But Eric, what would you add to that?
Eric Andersen: Yes, Greg. So first of all, I would say that strong retention and strong new business really are an outcome of the work that's been going on in the quarter. But just to touch a little bit on the priority hires, if I could, for a second, as you mentioned, in the key specialty areas, construction, energy, other industry areas. We're looking at those investments in people like we do any other investment. We want to bring in the best talent that is out there, support them with the best tools and analytics, whether it's the new analyzers that Christa talked about, some of the broker-led analytics, new tools like automated certificates of insurance to make sure we're providing the right colleague and client experience. But I would also say that the analyzers fit into what we've been doing around the $1 billion investment in ABS and those tools. And when you match that talent, that new talent and existing talent, right, the great talent that's already here at Aon, with those new tools, you begin to provide a different experience for our colleagues who can actually serve their clients better, but also to the clients themselves who get better insight from us really begin to unlock the analytics that we've been talking about, match that with the global broking capability, the access to the reinsurance capital, really the whole strategy around how we're bringing capital to clients, and you see a different experience. And we've seen it in client events, whether it's at RIMS or our property symposium or other client events that have been going on in the first half of the year, you really see the excitement from the clients who are starting to really understand what we're trying to give to them in the whole ecosystem of tools and talent and people. I could share stories and tell you some client wins and things. But really, the new news are these risk analyzers and you see it also on the Health side. The ability to show a client where their risks are, how they structure a program around it and then how they access global capital with a client leader who fully understands their business is actually helping us drive better, stronger retention and better net new business wins.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my follow-up question, the tax rate in the quarter went to -- above 22%. I know you guys have typically guided, right, to 18.5%, which is like the five-year average. Is there something -- is your tax rate structurally higher with NFP? Or is there something one-off that we should think about when thinking about the run rate tax rate?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question, Elyse. In Q2, similar to Q1, the tax rate was driven by a geographic mix of income and the impact of unfavorable discretes. I would note that discrete can be favorable or unfavorable in any one quarter, and therefore, the rate can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We really do think about it over the full year. And as you said, Elyse, we don't give guidance going forward, but that is a historical accurate rate going backwards.
Elyse Greenspan: And then one more quick one, Christa. I think you said NFP expected $45 million to $60 million of EBITDA in M&A, and you're on track this year, but I think there was $36 million of revenue so far. So is it just that you guys are -- see a pipeline that would probably be more back half than first half-weighted in terms of transactions?
Christa Davies: That is exactly right, Elyse. And what we've really seen is the acquisition activities NFP slowed down a little as they were negotiating with us for obvious reasons. But the pipeline looks incredibly strong in the back half of the year, and we think they are fully on track to deliver that $45 million to $60 million of EBITDA in 2024.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. And also just a congratulations to Christa on the next phase of her career. What an awesome run you've had at Aon. Just exceptional leadership operationally, technologically, I mean, unparalleled as a CFO. So we'll miss watching you in action, but congrats on the next phase.
Christa Davies: Thank you very much, Andrew.
Andrew Kligerman: Sure. And then I guess moving back to Commercial Risk Solutions, and Greg, you mentioned and Eric mentioned new hires in the energy area. Could you elaborate a little bit on where -- and actually, let me take a step back. I mean, there was a lot of maybe concern out there that net hires were negative at Aon. So could you talk about 2Q was net producer staffing positive or negative? Was that a big influence on the 2Q? And how do you see that playing out in the second half of the year? Do you think you'll be net hiring positive?
Greg Case: Yes. So thank you, Andrew. Appreciate it, and I really appreciate your perspectives. First, take a step back overall. Just to remind, we have currently the highest engagement we've had in basically almost forever. It's a really positive story that continues to evolve and build. And it really is a function of our colleagues understanding and really contributing to and leading the ability for us to support and help clients. And if you think about the example we started off with today, it's a powerful example of what we can do and the impact our firm can have, and that's really -- that generates a lot of energy around our firm. That's why our engagement is so high. That's reflected in our attrition, and our voluntary attrition continues to be very low, lower than back to pre-pandemic. So very, very positive from that standpoint. It's really against that context, we also, though, said, listen, there are some areas where we think there are some priority opportunities. Construction is one, energy is one, et cetera, and there are a few others around the firm. And we've had great fortune in bringing colleagues in to drive that. But I think Eric's point that we're not just -- this isn't about numbers, this is about capability. So it's bringing in great practitioners and then arming them with our colleagues with these capabilities, these set of analytics. And make no mistake about it, what we've done with the analyzers, we think, is unique and it really is supported by an Aon Business Services platform also unique. And then remember, we also made the unpopular decision to invest $1 billion to accelerate that capability. And you're starting to see that show up, the beginnings of that. You saw it in the second quarter, you'll see it in the third and the fourth quarter and into 2025 and 2026. So that's really what's going on in terms of where we are. And you'll see us continue to make that investment as it strengthens the firm and our client-serving capability. But Eric, what else you got there?
Eric Andersen: I would also -- I would broaden the aperture a little bit around just thinking about producers. Greg, you talked about the tools, which are absolutely right. But when you think about what we do for clients, it's more than just production. It's does the client manager or client executive understand the client industry? Does the broker, if it's an energy broker, be able to talk about the risks of a client? Or the claims people or the risk analytics people being able to sort of match that to the industry expertise? So when we talk about investments in areas like construction or energy or life sciences and pharmaceuticals, it really is broader than just a producer. You actually have to have that skill set to be able to serve that client all the way through the chain on the risk side and more and more so on the talent and health and wealth side as well. So we are investing in those areas where we see growth, and we plan to continue to make those investments as the year progresses.
Andrew Kligerman: So I guess just kind of putting the -- framing it a little bit. This 6% organic revenue growth, it fits in with your mid-single digit or higher objective and it really shouldn't come as a surprise, right? It kind of fits with this strategy that you're describing?
Greg Case: Yes. Andrew, if you step back and think about where we were, I know everyone tends to look at the quarter-to-quarter, we look at the overall trend over time, and in particular, just great, pure, core skill in our ability to make a difference with clients. And what we're describing is with the 3x3 plan, this is not conceptual. This is a serious double down on an organization around risk capital, which means we're connecting reinsurance and commercial risk capability in a way that's never been connected in our industry before. On the human capital side, as Eric talked about, with talent, health and retirement, that combination that has then been reinforced and supported and driven by Aon Business Services, and if you think about the talent, to the talent question you raised, we brought a very unique set of talent skills in Aon Business Services from our industry, but candidly, well outside of our industry from firms like Conagra and like Walmart, and like Google, and like Accenture and they've come together and did some things that have never been done. So that, to us, is the foundation that's been set down. And all you're seeing in the second quarter is just a manifestation of as that happens. That then gets amplified when you bring in capability, as Eric has described, and we're doing that and continuing to focus on that. So that's the story. And our view is, again, it's '24, '25 and '26. It's three commitments over the next three years that we think put us in a unique position to not only succeed with clients, but to build momentum, even Edmund alluded to this as he came in, to build momentum beyond 2026. So that's exactly what we're on track to do, and you can expect continuation in the second half of the year to see that play out.
Andrew Kligerman: Got it. And then just quickly on NFP. Christa mentioned $45 million to $60 million of EBITDA acquired -- each year. How about a more sizable middle market acquisition? Is that something in the cards? Or is it something that maybe you need to digest NFP and maybe a year or two or three down the road, you start thinking about that?
Greg Case: Listen, first of all, you always step back, as Christa described, and has always done around our ROIC, return on invested capital framework, and what we're trying to do to sort of maximize outcome for our clients but also for our shareholders. So everything is in the construct of that. Listen, we love this platform. This has been fantastic. We had very high expectations of NFP coming in and they've been exceeded. Now it's only two months, but Doug Hammond and the team have been fantastic working with Eric, absolutely fantastic. We love this platform, what this platform can do. So that's really where we're going to concentrate. We're going to focus on that and reinforce the M&A plan that Christa talked about and really bring capability of Aon Business Services into the middle market in a unique way as well. And if you think about it, we want our colleagues in NFP to understand had a great franchise and capability before, now with additional capability for Aon, wow, even more for that producer group. So this is really going to be our focal point in every way, shape or form. And what we're finding is that's absolutely true. And also NFP has capability that actually resonates across global Aon. So it really is going both ways sort of in the context of it. So look for us to focus on that, to get that right and that's going to be our mission and really our obsession as we sort of complete '24 and into 2025.
Andrew Kligerman: Awesome. Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Zaremski: Hey, good morning. Back to the -- so on the -- just curious with the math when you say share repurchases is the highest ROIC opportunity. Am I wrong to assume that M&A now on the NFP platform would be a higher ROIC opportunity? But of course, given just the size of Aon and the amount of M&A you can do that you can't spend it all in the near term. Or am I thinking about the math incorrectly, assuming recently a market multiple is paid for M&A and smaller acquisitions.
Christa Davies: Yes. Thanks so much for the question. The first thing I'd say is if you model the free cash flow growth of Aon, which is substantial and accelerating as a result of the 3x3 plan and the investment we've made in restructuring and the return on that and NFP, the highest return on capital across Aon remains share buyback. It is a phenomenal return. It's a phenomenal return at today's price. It's a phenomenal return at our all-time highs. And so we will disproportionately allocate capital to share buyback, which is what you've seen us do, despite commitments we've got in 2024 on paying down debt and delevering and the NFP transaction costs and some other uses of cash in 2024. And we'll commit to do over $1 billion of buyback in 2024 and over the long-term because that's really driving amazing free cash flow growth, and therefore, amazing free cash flow per share growth for shareholders.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Interesting. Some of your peers, I guess, maybe probably more optimistic on the margins that I'm modeling out. But just switching gears a bit to just the overall market environment in organic growth. Great to see an improvement in Risk Solutions and organic. Would it be -- I know you characterized the M&A environment is picking up a bit. I mean, would it be fair to say, I know you've given us tidbits in the past that financial lines, cyber where Aon is one of the leaders, is still kind of a drag, but lesser of a drag. And to the extent those lines eventually kind of pricing normalizes that we -- that this is just a kind of a pricing impact that's going on? Any other color you want to kind of provide on some of the macro that's been going on?
Eric Andersen: Sure. This is Eric. Why don't I take this one? I think, listen, what we're describing here is a transitioning market where you look at it across the global platform of Aon, you'd see essentially pricing is, we'd call it, flat. But within that, there's 100 mini markets. You've got property, you've got casualty, specialty lines, et cetera. Overall, you're still seeing, as you asked around cyber and D&O, you're seeing pricing very much in favor of a buyer, a buyer's market, but that pricing is moderating. So it's not as steep as it was earlier. On the transaction services, Greg mentioned it, but I would just say that we're seeing an appropriate share of the pipeline of things that are happening. So we feel pretty good about that. Property is, I would say, heading towards flat for -- on average. But with better risks, maybe there's an opportunity for a price decrease. For more challenging risk, maybe it's still up a little bit. Casualty is probably the area that's getting the most attention right now, especially based on sort of coming out of the pandemic, was the pricing right and there have been reserve needs. So there's questions around casualty, especially around auto and anything with wheels, I would say, but that will develop. But that is actually still an increasing market from a pricing standpoint. What I would also say, when you get into a scenario, like this client's behavior actually changes. They make different decisions. So as they're able to potentially save in certain areas, they will invest that premium elsewhere because during the last five years of a challenging market, they made decisions going the other way where they actually reduced some of the insurance, took higher retentions, narrower coverage, that type of thing. And so they're able to revisit some of those decisions in this kind of a market. So our expectation is as we go through the rest of the year, you're going to continue to see the market transition in the way that it is right now. But ultimately, client behavior changes. And it's one of actually, just to go back to the analyzer comment, it's one of the beauties of this risk analyzer on the insurance side that it actually compares their existing programs and allows them to make different risk trading decisions as to where to deploy new capital to protect themselves and change structure. So it is a great opportunity for clients to reevaluate where they are today and how they build the right financial protection for them going forward.
Michael Zaremski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. So first, I just had a question on organic growth in Commercial Risk. This was, I think, the best quarter you've had in over a year. So if you were to point to maybe two or three items that might have -- like what are the few large items that might have driven the uptick versus what you've seen in the last several quarters? I don't know to what extent it was hiring or capital markets activity, but any color that you could give on the drivers of the pickup?
Greg Case: So Jimmy, thanks for the question. I'll start, and Eric, add additional color from the client standpoint. As we talked about, Jimmy, this is really net new business generation and strong retention. Those are the two macro pieces sort of that drive this. What causes that? What causes that is literally what we're doing at the call phase with clients, and what we put in place last year on risk capital and human capital really reinforces that. Eric just talked about the examples on the risk analyzers. These investments, Jimmy, are unique. I mean they are literally putting us in a position where we can help clients see the risk market a bit differently and make different choices. The prior question was about unit price. This isn't about unit price. This is overall about overall volatility and how you think about it across the coverage lines. We have a chance to sort of talk to clients about that. That's why you win new logos. That's why you do more with clients. That's why you keep them longer. All those things are beginning to show up. And what we've highlighted is you can expect that to continue to progress for the back half of the year and into '25 and '26. So this is really what's driving what we're doing. This is the baseline. When you add on top of that the investments we're making in capability in some of these priority areas that we see great demand, we've name checked construction and energy. There are a few others, but those are the big pieces. And that's really the overall set of drivers. Eric, anything else you want to throw in there?
Eric Andersen: Greg, maybe let me pick it up a little bit of a level. We put out a report recently around a better decisions report that focused in on these four major trends that are happening around tech, trade, workforce and weather and how business leaders feel like they're not prepared to deal with all these. And this cyber-attack or system outage that happened this week is just one example that brings it to mind. And so clients are really looking hard at their risk exposures that give us an opportunity as a connected firm globally with the right analytics to be able to help them navigate some of these topics. And so we've been seeing this building in terms of client need and strong growth in Europe, strong growth in Latin America, connected around client opportunities everywhere in the world. So a lot of the underpinnings that have been our Aon United strategy have really begun to take effect in a period where clients feel significant need.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then maybe on the tax item, how much of the uptick in the tax rate versus last year was because of just the geographic and the product mix versus maybe some discrete items, just to get an idea on where it would have been otherwise?
Christa Davies: Yes. Thanks for the question. We haven't actually given that detail in terms of the split, but it is consistent with Q1 in that the two things driving it really are the mix of geographic income and unfavorable discretes. And I would say discretes can be favorable or unfavorable in any one quarter, which makes the tax rate lumpy by quarter, and I would go back to saying the way we think about it is over the course of a full year.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Cox: Hey, thanks. So yes, there's been a couple of questions here on Commercial Risk, organic. But I don't think specifically on net new business in the US, which I think you guys were a little bit more cautious on last quarter. It looks like North America turned around a bit, and I don't think net new business would have necessarily been one of those things that were kind of nonrecurring last quarter. So any additional color on how that net new business trends in the US? And if it improved meaningfully, what would have driven that quarter-over-quarter?
Greg Case: Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. Step back for a second. Be careful with quarter-to-quarter you sort of compare where we are. Think about sort of Commercial Risk versus Q2 '23, we're 6% here, 5% the last quarter, so it's a progression over kind of a comparable quarter. And really, the fundamentals are exactly what we said they are. It really is net new business. It's better, it's stronger retention across the board. And also, by the way, the connectivity of our firm means we're doing things in human capital that leverages off of risk capital and then in risk capital it leverages off of human capital in ways that's sort of actually we're doing more with clients, and you're seeing that as well. And so that's the progression. And as we really dug into the 3x3 plan, as we closed last year and began this year, you're starting to see the momentum around that. You didn't see as much of that in Q1 as you now see in Q2, and we think it's going to continue to pick up as we continue to introduce the analyzers and all the capability and the service enhancements that Eric has talked about. So that really is the driver. This is really global, though. If you think about it, all of our solution lines are at 6% or greater, all of our solution lines. And the geographic strength was really global, even more so outside the US than even inside the US. And so that will continue to progress. And -- but that's really -- it's not complicated. It's just execution and we continue to execute and then amplified by priority capability we're bringing in from a hiring standpoint.
Robert Cox: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then on this priority hiring pipeline, I think energy and construction are two areas with strong current growth. I guess, do you see growth in those areas continuing to be strong? And maybe you could help us size maybe the margin impact from this priority hiring pipeline.
Eric Andersen: Sure. And I would say, listen, if you go back to what I just said about those four trends and you think about trade and the reshoring. So that's usually manifest in our industry as construction as global supply chains become sort of nearer to home basis you see a significant amount of construction. Our enterprise client strategy where we are connecting with clients around the world, as they build into North America or they build into Mexico or other areas, we're there to capture and work with those clients on those exposures. Certainly, energy, not just traditional energy, but renewable energy. It's a very specific expertise both on a client management but also a sort of brokerage capability to be able to draw capital. Our ability to invest there is important. Don't forget the analytic investment that's needed as well to be able to provide the insight around how to strategically manage those risks and ultimately match capital to that risk. So we are investing across the spectrum of capability within that industry framework. You could put financial institutions, you could put pharmaceutical. We highlight construction and energy because they're so tangible and people can see what's happening, but there are certainly other areas where we are investing as well. But it goes across not just production, but through capability all the way through analytics.
Robert Cox: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. And if I could sneak in one more. Just wanted to ask if the time line for NFP to be accretive to adjusted EPS is still 2026? And if you could provide any updated color there?
Christa Davies: Yes. So we are exactly on track with all deal financials and returns on the deal, including EPS accretion. Dilutive in '24, breakeven in '25 and accretive in '26. And I would note that free cash flow per share follows that same trajectory. And so we are super excited, albeit early days, two months in on delivering on the revenue synergies, the cost synergies and the free cash flow of $300 million in 2025 and $600 million in 2026.
Robert Cox: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
David Motemaden: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Also, I wanted to extend my congratulations to Christa and wish you good luck on the next chapter.
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, David.
David Motemaden: So I had a question just -- so Greg, when I -- it's a bigger picture question just sort of looking back over the last seven, eight years at the drivers of organic growth at Aon. And if I look historically, we've seen most of the organic growth really coming from productivity improvement as opposed to adding head count. Over this call and the last call, it's mentioned just hiring more than in the past, which I think is a welcome change. I just wanted to sort of level set my expectations here and how you guys are thinking about the balance between maybe adding head count now as well as productivity improvement going forward?
Greg Case: Yes. Really appreciate the question, David. Listen, to step back, again, this thesis we've talked about is consistent and it will continue forever with this team and it really is around capability and delivering one client at a time and how you create the maximum leverage to do that for that client. And that means that whether you call it productivity, effectiveness, we need better solutions, better content to support these clients. By the way, if you haven't seen this megatrend analysis Eric's talked about, we love to send you a copy. You've got to take a look at this. And this is not -- our genius, this is looking around the world in the sense of saying what are clients facing? And we not only did the megatrends report, we actually did a survey on top of it. Went out and talked to 800 C-suite executives around how they think about these megatrends. David, all four of these were kind of five alarm fires, three of which they basically said, I need help on. And so right now, I don't know exactly what to do. Against that, you need, again, whether you call it productivity, you need better capability. To be blunt, you've got to give them better insight and that's really been the investment. And if you think about it, part of the investment is connected investment. We actually have to operate as a global firm. If someone's coming out of Europe to invest in the US and our colleagues aren't talking to each other, that means our clients integrating for. No, we're not going to do that. We're going to serve in an integrated way on behalf of client need. And we've done that. And by the way, call that productivity over the last number of years, that served us really well. And what you've seen us now do with the 3x3 is say, look, we're going to double down on that. We see even more opportunity, again, coming out of this megatrends report and what we're hearing from clients, and we are doubling down. This is a Aon Business Services. This is talent, capability and the risk analytics. This is a $1 billion bet to really strengthen that. And then we've said with that capability, our ability then to bring in colleagues and to arm our current colleagues is now greater. And so the reason we see opportunity to bring additional talent is the need is high. And when they come in, it isn't just more bodies. It's more individuals, no doubt, but it's actually more individuals, each of whom have greater capability, both in analytics, but also in a way in which we are really delivering on their behalf. So this is what you see us doing right now and it really cuts across all of our solution lines. So it really is a nice combination sort of in terms of where we are. And we're going to be able to do this without backing up on our commitments, mid-single-digit or greater, improved margins and free cash flow. And just to be clear, what's happening on free cash flow is an opportunity for us, which we think is quite unique for us and for you, and it really is the translation of revenue into free cash flow. The 3x3 is going to take what has been a decade-plus double-digit free cash flow growth and it's going to strengthen it. And so that's with additional capability, magnified by additional individuals. And so really -- there really isn't one over the other, David, it's both, and we're doubling down on capability and in doing so, it creates the opportunity. It's also why NFP was so attractive for us. We can bring this capability now not just at the large corporate arena, but into the middle market and we can do so with this incredible platform called NFP. So that really -- that's the combination. Now that's easy to say and really hard to do and almost impossible to duplicate. But that's the mission, that's what we love. And that's what you're starting to see in Q2 and you'll see throughout the year.
David Motemaden: Great, thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on that. You mentioned the middle market business. I guess, could you just now, with NFP, how much of the Commercial Risk business is middle market as you guys would define it?
Eric Andersen: Look, I think there is still a significant amount of room for us to grow in middle market. It's one of the reasons why we're so excited about this independent and connected philosophy that we're bringing to the NFP team. Independent as in we want their 900 salespeople certainly continuing to do what they've been doing historically for NFP, but they're seeing challenges to their client base around some of these risks that we've been talking about, whether it's cyber, et cetera, that are actually getting closer to the middle market as a real risk. And their ability to use Aon content or Aon producers and client leaders being able to use some of the NFP content for the middle market business that sits within Aon is such a great opportunity to drive more activity and more opportunity for us to serve that middle market client base. But we're still -- we still see a lot of runway in front of us on what you would call a $31 billion market. We're still relatively underweight in that space. And so there's a lot of good room to run here.
David Motemaden: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your questions.
Meyer Shields: Great, thanks. Thanks so much. I also want to congratulate Christa on never having to take another question from me except for this one.
Christa Davies: Thank you, Meyer.
Meyer Shields: My pleasure. Is it safe to say that the geographic footprint of earnings, including NFP, with regard to taxes is different than legacy Aon over the last decade?
Christa Davies: We are definitely more US weighted, that is true, because NFP is more US weighted.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. That's what I wanted to know or confirm. And with regard to the investments in talent that you've been talking about, can you give us a sense of the timeline in terms of -- like how much of this unusual effort has already been done? And how does the hiring timeline compared to the productivity timeline?
Eric Andersen: Listen, I would say when we launched the 3x3 strategy back at the middle of -- the end of last year, we outlined for ourselves the priority investments that we wanted to make where we thought there was real need for us to serve clients. And so it is not something we started last week, if that's your question. We've been looking at it essentially over the last 12 months. How you actually build that pipeline of talent, how you actually get them into the firm, how you onboard them, how you take existing Aon clients and deploy them into those growth areas as well has been something that's been going on parallel to bringing in outside talent. So it's not just an outside talent discussion. So it's something that we identified as we laid out the 3x3 plan. It's something we see over the next two to three years as well as a real opportunity for the firm to invest in growth.
Greg Case: And Meyer, to your question on productivity, listen, productivity evolves over time. It doesn't happen immediately, as you know. If you ask yourself how much of the hiring shows up in Q2 of 2024? Limited, right? These folks are just coming in. But by the way, they ramp a lot faster when you give them the content capability Eric's describing because they have skills and capability and it's not going to their existing clients, it's going to new clients, which they love to be able to do and come in and build our portfolio. So for us, this amplification is going to really play out in '25 and '26 in a powerful way. But in the meantime, the capability we have across our current field is what's driving results.
Meyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That's what I needed to know.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Grace Carter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Grace Carter: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have one more on, I guess, talent acquisition. I think you mentioned maybe some talent acquisition in NFP. Just how have you found, I guess, competition for talent in the middle market versus where you've historically played so far? And I guess, how receptive are people that have historically worked in the middle market to joining a larger organization? And how might your capabilities be an advantage when you're looking to hire in that market?
Eric Andersen: So thanks for the question. I would say there is a war for talent where there is good talent everywhere. So whether it's the large segment, whether it's the small segment, the mid-market segment, whether it's in Health and Wealth or Risk. So I think you can safely assume that where there are good people, there are people chasing those good people. And so when we laid out the premise for the NFP integration with Aon around independent and connected, we did that under the guise of understanding that would be valuable to the individual colleague at NFP is to be able to serve their client in the same format that they used to serve them in terms of that strong personal relationship, but give them better content and give them better tools over time. And so early on in the process, the content piece we are connecting very quickly, which can be connecting them to our broking centers, giving them access to our programs or facilities, showing, beginning to map out how do you deliver analytics at scale through ABS into the middle market client base. On the Health side, how do you actually -- with complementary client sets, how do you begin to aggregate the data to be able to give better insight to that client. So really what we're trying to do with the NFP colleague is make them better in terms of the tools that they have. They already have great relationships. It's how do we make them better in the areas that they want to serve those clients. We think that ultimately will allow us to draw more individual people in. We're already seeing that the pipeline on M&A is a better quality pipeline for the NFP team because this independent and connected capability is really resonating with these firms who are seeing that their clients are looking for more. They don't want to give up that relationship piece. And so I think we're finding the best of a big firm with a lot of capabilities and a mid-market firm that's strong in relationships and finding that connection, being able to use the analytics, being able to use the technology and being able to use the content, but in a way that drives for them better outcomes while still maintaining those relationships. So that's the goal and that's what we're -- as Christa said, two months in, early days. But we feel pretty good about how we've started.
Grace Carter: Thank you. And I also wanted to ask about the Wealth organic growth. It was quite a bit higher than how it's historically trended, maybe kind of in the mid-single digits, maybe low single digits. Is there anything in there that would be unusual this quarter? Or to what extent like these results are sustainable going forward? And can you just remind us if there's anything in the NFP acquisition that might change the mix of that business going forward? Thank you.
Greg Case: Appreciate the question. And just to be brief, we can go into any detail offline, if it's helpful, Grace, as you think about it. But listen, this has been -- it's just a terrific business and the team has done an amazing job. The pension risk transfer is a big, big part of the world these days, particularly in the US and the UK. We have an incredibly strong leading position in that. You're seeing that play through, the regulatory challenges and changes. So all these things sort of fit and NFP has an incredibly strong capability in this arena, too, and we're seeing that as well. But again, to emphasize what you see in the 9% is the Aon results overall, even without NFP, and that's what you see playing out. Just an exceptionally strong team in the current environment.
Grace Carter: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cave Montazeri with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Cave Montazeri: Yes. I just wanted to follow up on your comments you just made on the last question. The NFP, the legacy NFP producers, are they already using the new tools from Aon? Or is that something that's going to take a bit longer to give them access to?
Eric Andersen: So in the planning process leading up to the close and then in the 90 days since we've closed, we've put a significant amount of work to connect them first with products and capabilities because I think that's the easiest thing to get started with. And then we're laying the track to be able to provide the analytic capabilities, both in Health, Wealth and in Risk, which will take a little bit of time as we go through the year. But we started with opening access to our broking center, opening products that we have an affinity or programs we have in Risk and Health to be able to offer them to their client base. So we've started with the things that are easier to connect, and we're laying the plans to do some of the more -- sort of the more structural things around analytics.
Cave Montazeri: Makes sense. And my second question is on cyber. In light of last week's CrowdStrike outage and the fact that it's unlikely to be the last time we see this given how interconnected the digital world is, on a go-forward basis, do you think your clients who already have cyber insurance, do you think they have the right amount of insurance and the right type of cyber protection in place in case their business comes to a halt due to systemic outage driven by the software glitch from the third-party or something of the like?
Eric Andersen: Sure. Listen, I think that's hard to answer that question on a macro basis in terms of what does each client have. Certainly, the focus has historically been on kind of malicious intent on a cyber-hack, but certainly a system outage not driven by a cyber-assault does create a new form of risk exposure. That's always been there, honestly, but maybe now is at the front of mind as people look to see the type of cover that they have. I think the insurance part of it, the risk taker part is certainly going to look at that from a scope of cover, price for the coverage, all that's healthy in a growing marketplace. But certainly, technology overall whether it's AI or cyber or what have you, it's certainly front of mind of our clients as we, Greg and I, both mentioned in that survey we just put out. And so I do think it will be an area where we continue to invest and want to be able to provide that capability and understanding to our clients with the cyber analyzer that we're launching. But certainly, when things like this happen, it certainly raises the profile and causes each of our clients to look pretty carefully at their own risk platform to understand it.
Cave Montazeri: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: Just wanted to do two things. First, again, recognize and welcome Edmund. Edmund, so awesome to have you around the leadership table, and just looking forward to our work and our mission together. And will be teed up and ready to go for Q3 to lead the call. So thanks for that, Edmund. And then, of course, to Christa. Christa, you are an extraordinary leader and an even more compelling individual. And thank you. Thank you so much on behalf of global Aon for 16 years of true, true excellence. Thanks so much. Talk to you soon everyone.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind both partes that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. 
 It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press conference covering our first quarter 2024 results as well as having been posted on our website. 
 Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc. 
Gregory Case: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. For your convenience, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. As always, we begin by thanking our colleagues around the world for the incredible work they do every day to support each other and deliver the best of our firm to clients. And this quarter, I also want to single out 1 colleague in particular. Our Chief Financial Officer; and my friend and partner, Christa Davies.  
 As you know, Christa announced her retirement from her role as CFO earlier this month, following over 16 years of tremendous service. With Christa's guidance, we developed a seamless transition plan. As previously announced, Christa remains in our CFO role for the second quarter earnings, and we're making strong progress against well-defined plans to have her successor in place to begin the handoff. I'm grateful that she'll continue to serve as a senior adviser into 2025 and to ensure great continuity. 
 Now to begin our report today, it's important to start by highlighting an incredibly exciting milestone for our firm. The completion of our work to bring NFP into the Aon family as we closed the transaction yesterday. Through the 7,700 NFP colleagues who now join our firm, welcome to Aon.  
 NFP's client relationships, capabilities, focused sales force and market knowledge provides a meaningfully expanded position in the fast-growing $31 billion North American middle market. Since our announcement in late December, we've gotten to know the team even better and our appreciation and excitement for what we can do together has continued to grow, and the opportunity is even more clear.  
 In commercial risk, complementary specialist resources and expertise from both organizations will enhance what we bring to clients, delivering Aon analytics and decision support tools to the NFP sales force allows for real differentiation on top of their highly integrated sales approach. Further, we can reintroduce and introduce, reinforce NFP's offerings with access to our programs and facilities like Aon Client Treaty and also in commercial risk, we can leverage our global Aon network for clients who require seamless global service to enhance an already strong NFP value proposition. 
 In Wealth Solutions, we see great opportunity to bring our capabilities around pension risk transfer to NFP clients as well as to continue to build on our investment offerings together, ensuring all clients have access to retirement options that best support their people.  
 And in Health Solutions, our businesses are highly complementary with new opportunities in the health value chain where we don't operate today or for clients that we only serve in one solution line. And for example, NFP brings outstanding health value proposition for clients with under 100 employees. An attractive option for our smaller clients in commercial risk.  
 Conversely, we see great opportunity to provide NFP's clients with our data and analytics solutions, including benchmarking and tools on health equity, network strategies and high-cost claimants. Further, we can support current NFP clients with specialized capabilities in areas such as global benefits, pharmacy consulting and consumer benefits. Another great strength of NFP is their exceptional M&A engine and very strong acquisition pipeline as we look to the future.  
 On deal financials, we're delighted to close much earlier than originally modeled with fewer shares issued and realization of benefits that now occur a year earlier. Noting we now expect EPS accretion to '26 and thereafter and additional free cash flow of $300 million and $600 million in 2025 and 2026, respectively. We're incredibly excited about the opportunity as we bring Aon and NFP content capabilities together enabled by Aon Business Services. We also see great value and the operating model built around the principle of independent and connected to deliver risk capital and human capital capability to our clients. All-in, this acquisition is another strong step forward in our Aon United journey and reinforces our long-term financial guidance to deliver mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term.  
 Turning now to our results in the quarter. Overall, our team delivered a strong start to the year with 5% overall organic revenue growth, 100 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 9% EPS growth. Within our solution lines, Reinsurance delivered 7% organic revenue growth as our team help clients navigate continuing market challenges, but with greater capacity and stable pricing on programs. Further, our team is increasingly building on traditional capabilities with enhanced data analytics and advisory capabilities.  
 In Health Solutions, delivered 6% organic revenue growth, with strong growth in core health across all major geographies, driven by strong ongoing new business generation and retention and strength in specialist capabilities like consumer and pharmacy benefits. In Wealth Solutions, organic growth of 4% reflected strength in retirement as our teams continue to help clients reduce risk through pension risk transfer and manage the ongoing impact of regulatory changes as we continue to bring leading capabilities to help clients match risk and capital.  
 In commercial risk, we saw 3% organic revenue growth highlighted by strength in Asia and the Pacific, Continental Europe and areas of our portfolio like construction. As we look at these results, especially in the U.S., we've seen the impact of our business mix play out. As we have strength and strong weighting in larger clients, especially lines like D&O, these are significant areas within our U.S. business, and again, areas where we're strong, and we see substantial long-term top and bottom line growth potential despite some current pressure reflected in net new business.  
 Going forward, we'll continue to be strong in these categories and continue hiring and investment in priority areas like energy and construction. We also observed, as we've mentioned previously, we're not seeing a real rebound yet in M&A and IPO activity, though we know there's demand and dry powder building. And until yesterday, we were relatively smaller in a $31 billion North American middle market. Although now with the close of NFP, we've added 7,700 colleagues and established a much more meaningful position in this fast-growing market.  
 Overall, across the firm, we continue to focus on our most critical asset, our talent. Our engagement remains at historically high levels, and our voluntary attrition in Q1 is at the lowest level in many years. On talent acquisition, we continue to increase hiring in selected client-facing areas as well as an analytics capability to support our efforts in risk capital and human capital.  
 In summary, we're making great progress to start the year. Our first quarter results and the close of NFP put us in a strong position to continue delivering results through 2024 and over the long term. This progress fully reinforces our 3x3 plan focused on 3 fundamental commitments over the next 3 years, including capitalizing on our work in risk capital and human capital, delivering Aon client leadership and amplifying these efforts through Aon Business Services. The strength importance and momentum of this plan is being strongly reinforced by ongoing client and colleague feedback, and this plan defines a powerful path forward, one that drives ongoing top and bottom line growth and greater levels of long-term free cash flow growth exactly consistent with our ongoing financial guidance.  
 Finally, as I turn the call over to Christa, I want to return to my opening comments and thank you again for her partnership, leadership and friendship. Ultimately, Christa will have left a permanent imprint on our Aon United strategy. For 16 years, our shared mission has been to connect to our colleagues to a one-firm mindset so they can deliver more value to clients. That mission is universally focused on accelerating Aon United and now in arguably our most exciting period is fully reflected in our 3x3 plan.  
 And Christa has been a critical partner in all this work. Our Aon colleagues will miss Christa in the CFO role. Personally, the journey with Christa is a highlight of my professional career. Our 52,000 colleagues and as of today, 60,000 and their families are in a better position because of Christa. And we're all grateful that Christa will be staying with us as a senior adviser to continue to drive momentum as she moves on to her next mission. And most important, we fully appreciate that there are other missions in life of higher priority, and we embrace Christa's decision to shift our focus at this time. 
 Christa, my friend, over to you. 
Christa Davies: Thank you so much, Greg. I want to start by thanking you for the opportunity over the last 16 years to contribute to the incredible success we've had at Aon. This will be the defining role of my career, and that's really what's at the heart of this decision. As you described, this decision isn't about other professional pursuits. My decision is to focus my time differently at this point in my life.  
 I'm grateful that our work together has created the ability for me to make this choice. I must say as our 3x3 plan delivers on its full potential in the months ahead, including with the great addition of NFP. I'm going to truly miss working so closely with this team to realize the tremendous value creation that is ahead for Aon. We're also very pleased to announce the completion of the NFP acquisition. I'm delighted to welcome the NFP to Aon.  
 We're excited to work together to capture the growth opportunities we see for clients, colleagues and shareholders. As we announced yesterday, we closed the transaction for a total enterprise value of $13 billion. The faster-than-expected close date means we now expect to achieve a similar benefit a year earlier with improvements in certain metrics noting, we maintained guidance for revenue and cost synergies of $235 million, which now occur a year earlier given the close date.  
 We achieved a lower interest rate on deal-related debt of 5.7% and we issued fewer shares at 19 million. Collectively, this results in similar deal related to natural benefits of accretion and free cash flow that are realized a year earlier than initially modeled. We now expect the deal to add $300 million to free cash flow in 2025 and $600 million in 2026 and be accretive in 2026 and over the long term. We've also provided detailed financial information for NFP in our materials.  
 NFP built on our long-term proven track record of strategically allocating capital at scale to high return opportunities to create long-term value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. And as Greg mentioned, it reinforces and accelerates our Aon United strategy and our 3x3 plan and adds to our strong momentum as we drive results in 2024 and over the long term.  
 Now turning to the quarter. We delivered strong operational performance to start the year, highlighted by 5% organic revenue growth, which translated into 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 8% adjusted operating income growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth. As Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 5%, driven by ongoing strong retention and net new business generation.  
 I'd note that fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, was $79 million. If you were to include fiduciary investment income, organic revenue growth would have been 70 basis points higher. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2024 and over the long term. And as we look forward, we continue to expect that NFP will contribute to the firm's overall revenue growth through organic revenue growth, including $175 million of net revenue synergies by 2026 and inorganic growth from ongoing M&A. 
 Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement in Q1 with adjusted operating margins of 39.7%, an increase of 100 basis points driven by revenue growth, portfolio mix shift efficiencies from Aon Business Services and Restructuring savings, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth.  
 Restructuring savings in Q1 were $20 million and contributed 50 basis points to adjusted operating margin expansion. Restructuring actions completed so far are expected to generate $90 million of savings in 2024 and we expect Restructuring savings will fall to the bottom line. 
 At this time, we continue to expect $100 million of realized savings in 2024 as we continue to execute against our plans for Aon Business Services and our business. Regarding the program, we are seeing real progress in our acceleration of Aon Business Services. This includes streamlining and improving operational processes around working capital, moving work to the best locations and enhancing clients and colleagues experience with great new tools such as our property, casualty, D&O and cyber analyzers.  
 As we've said previously, we know delivering our Aon Business Services strategy will result in long-term top and bottom line growth as we drive more value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. As we think about adjusted operating margins going forward, we continue to expect to drive margin expansion over the long term through ongoing revenue growth and portfolio mix shift to higher growth, higher margin areas of the portfolio driven by efficiencies from Aon Business Services.  
 Now that we've closed NFP, margins will be initially lower. Considering the close timing, we think the right baseline from which to measure 2024 adjusted operating margin growth is 30.6%, calculated as our 31.6% in 2023 and less 100 basis point drag from NFP for the period from April 25 close through the end of 2024. In our materials, we've detailed 2023 operating performance for NFP. On a full year basis, we would note that NFP would have had a full year pro forma drag of 140 basis points for 2023. So there will be some ongoing drag on 2025 margins until we lap the close in April 2025.  
 We also expect fiduciary investment income to be relatively flat year-over-year based on current interest rate expectations. So the tailwind that we've seen in Q1 this year will be reduced although we remain committed to driving full year adjusted operating margin expansion in 2024 against this adjusted baseline of 30.6% and over the long term.  
 Turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS grew 9% in the quarter, reflecting 8% adjusted operating income growth and ongoing share buyback, partially offset by a higher tax rate in the quarter. With respect to NFP, as we previously communicated, we expect the acquisition to be dilutive to adjusted EPS in the remainder of 2024, breakeven in 2025 and accretive to adjusted EPS in 2026 and beyond.  
 Turning to free cash flow. I'd note Q1 has historically been our seasonally smallest quarter from a cash flow standpoint due primarily to incentive compensation payments. And as we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We generated $261 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, reflecting strong operating income growth and lower CapEx, offset by higher receivables, payments related to E&O, restructuring, NFP transaction and integration charges and higher cash tax payments as we've previously communicated.  
 As we look forward, we expect ongoing negative impacts of free cash flow in the near term from restructuring, higher interest expense and NFP deal and integration costs. The NFP acquisition strengthens our long-term free cash flow outlook with $300 million of incremental free cash flow in 2025 and $600 million in 2026. Over the long term, we would expect to return to our trajectory of double-digit free cash flow growth, driven by operating income growth and a $500 million opportunity in working capital.  
 Now turning to capital allocation. We allocate capital based on return on capital and long-term value creation, which we've done over time through core business investment, share buyback and M&A. Regarding M&A, as you look historically, we have a successful track record of balancing acquisitions, divestitures and share buyback as we continue to optimize our portfolio against our priority investment areas on an ROIC basis. We're incredibly excited about NFP's impressive M&A engine, noting their strong history of M&A. We look forward to building on their established track record and executing against their strong pipeline to drive future growth in this space within our ROIC framework.  
 We still expect share buyback to remain the top priority for capital allocation. As we think about capital allocation in 2024, we observed there are puts and takes around free cash flow that we've communicated. And while buyback will be lower than last year, we expect it will still be substantial at $1 billion or more based on our current M&A expectations for the rest of the year. We have a very strong long-term free cash flow outlook for the firm and are confident that share repurchase will continue to remain our highest ROIC opportunity for meaningful ongoing capital allocation over time. 
 Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet. As previously communicated, we funded the cash and assumed liabilities portion of the NFP purchase with approximately $7 billion of new debt, with $5 billion raised in March 2024 and $2 billion borrowed at close. And I note the average interest rate for the $5 billion of transaction-related senior notes and the $2 billion term loan is 5.7%, about 80 basis points better than what we modeled when we announced the deal. We expect our credit ratios to be elevated over the next 12 to 18 months as we bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels consistent with our credit profile. 2.8x to 3x debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis. This is driven by substantial free cash flow generation and incremental debt capacity from EBITDA growth noting our track record of effectively managing leverage within current ratings. 
 In summary, our operating performance in Q1 is a strong start to the year, and we're well positioned to build on this momentum in the rest of the year.  We're delighted to have closed NFP acquisition ahead of schedule, enabling us to achieve financial benefits of accretion and free cash flow a year earlier than initially modeled. We look forward to enhancing NFP's strong client relationships with Aon's content and capabilities and see real opportunity to learn from each other and bring better solutions to our clients together. It's another step forward in our 3x3 plan as we accelerate our Aon United strategy, capitalized by Aon Business Services and reinforced by the restructuring program. 
 With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Andrew Kligerman with TD Securities. 
Andrew Kligerman: Congratulations, Christa. Greg, you mentioned in the opening remarks the lowest attrition that Aon has seen in a while. Could you put any details around that? Any color? It sounds very interesting. 
Gregory Case: Well, I appreciate the question. Listen, if you step back and think about sort of talent overall and what we're about and what we're up to. This is really about how we built on Aon United and the strategy around the culture, and it's been foundational, how we connect our colleagues support each other and deliver the best we can for our clients. And that has just continued to build, and it really gives them an opportunity to sit across the table to do some pretty unique things with clients, which is why they're here, why they're excited about being part of our firm. 
 And then on top of that now, we've got the 3x3 plant, Andrew, which literally is going to continue to enhance this very substantially with greater content and capability and risk capital and human capital as well as the analytics that underpin all that driven by ABS. So for all those reasons, this is a pretty unique place to be at a time when clients have high need. 
 But Eric, what else would you add to that? 
Eric Andersen: Yes. Greg, maybe I'll just take it down. If you're an account leader or a colleague working with a client just picking up on your example, cultural capabilities, team support, all those drive a decision to either come or stay at our firm. And if you just think about it, historically, if you were a part of a client team, you were having a product discussion with a client. 
 Today, you're having -- if it's a risk client, you're having a risk capital discussion. So you're having colleagues from commercial risk from REIT maybe captives, maybe risk consulting, using new tools like risk analyzers that Christa mentioned that are created with our ABS colleagues, it creates a professional development for them, and it creates a team based environment where you're actually providing real new value to clients. And so I think all of that drives why people come and then ultimately, why they stay with us. 
Andrew Kligerman: Awesome. And then just shifting over to the tax rate around 23% this quarter. It was a bit surprising just given that over the last several years, it's kind of hovered around 18.5%. And I know Christa doesn't give guidance on this, but maybe given the big move in the tax rate, and your points in the write-up of that changing geography, you could give us a little color on, a, the change in geography of the tax; and b, maybe an exception and an indication of where we might expect the tax rate to be going forward, especially with NFP there. 
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question, Andrew. And we did see a higher tax rate this quarter driven by, as you said, changes in the geographic distribution of income and unfavorable discrete. And I will note, Andrew, that discrete has historically been positive for us, and in this quarter, they really did just line up to be net negative. And what I would say is, look, it's just lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And as you said, we don't give guidance going forward. But if we look back historically, exclusive of the impact of discrete, which can be positive or negative, our historic underlying rate for the last 5 years has been 18%. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. 
Jamminder Bhullar: So first, I just had a question on organic growth in commercial risk. If we look over the past year, 1.5 years or so, it seems to have lagged what we've seen at some of your peers. And initially, I think a lot of people were concerned that this was because of the fallout from Willis. You've highlighted the capital markets activity pressuring your results more than peers as well. But wondering if you just talk about why you feel your growth has lagged some of your large peers, even though historically, you've actually been fairly consistent with growth with most of the other competitors. 
Gregory Case: So Jimmy, I really appreciate the question. And maybe what I'd do is I'll step back and just again orient overall for Global Aon, how we think about the firm and how we think about progress over time. And if you step back, we essentially said, first of all, this is not about 1 quarter. It really is about as you look across over the year, kind of how we're performing across Global Aon over the course of the year. And our mission right now, which we're going to continue to push on and really amplify is the build on the 3x3 plan over the next 3 years. 
 So this is really capitalizing on risk capital and human capital, amplifying through Aon Business Services and delivering Aon Client leadership which we know Jimmy is going to together deliver both top line and bottom line performance and most important, the double-digit annual free cash flow growth compared to our '23 baseline that Christa described. And if you think about the quarter, which you're coming back to now asking specifically, and I'm going to get to commercial risk very explicitly in a second. 
 But our goals in the quarter from our standpoint were actually accelerated in terms of that 3x3 plan. So you think about ABS, the introduction of our analyzers and the client experience improvements, client response has been exceptional and real progress in the quarter. Our restructuring plan, as Christa highlighted, strengthened really what we've done in ABS substantially, and it really supports substantial hiring in priority areas. 
 So all good from a priority standpoint, then obviously, of course, the announcement of NFP with truly game changer access into the North American middle market. And really, every -- you think about all aspects of general aspects of the close improved since our December '20's announcement. So if we step back -- I mean, you sort of say, how are we doing from our standpoint, we feel very good, especially about the 3x3 plan and the progress we made on it. 
 And if you think about the quarter overall for Aon, we delivered mid-single digit growth, 5% with strength in Health and Reinsurance in Continental Europe and Asia and the Pacific. Margin expansion, 100 basis points, EPS growth of 9% and free cash flow exactly in line with expectations. And then specifically to your question, because I want to make sure I get to that. Look, we saw strength in commercial across Continental Europe, Asia and Pacific, all very good. We highlighted the mix play as we think about where we really have large portions of our business related to our larger clients, especially in terms of specialty lines like D&O and there's some pressure there. 
 What we also observed, obviously, as we just described, we were very underweight in the fast-growing middle market until yesterday. And now we see a massive opportunity going forward. They are all consistent with the 3x3 plan, and we've communicated previously the negative impact on transaction and IPO activity, which is you have to rebound but we are very confident it will. So from our standpoint, look, we feel very good about the trajectory and what we're going to be able to do over time and deliver on the 3x3 plan in a very clear way. 
 And it's going to be a great outcome for clients, great outcomes for our colleagues who would deliver that value and ultimately for our shareholders. And I just want to reiterate, as what Christa described, we're at mid-single-digit organic growth or greater, and that commitment holds across '24 and over the long term, and we fully expect to translate that into, frankly, strong top line and bottom line performance. 
Jamminder Bhullar: Okay. And then just following up on buybacks. I'm assuming this year is going to be lower than last year, partly because of the drag because of NFP and also the drag because of the restructuring program. But if we think about 1Q, was it also depressed because of just seasonality of cash flows? Or is this sort of a normal quarter in terms of buybacks. 
Christa Davies: Yes. So Jimmy, thank you for the question. And I did actually give specific guidance in my opening remarks about buyback because I recognize that there's a lot of puts and takes around free cash flow as we've communicated. And while buyback will be lower than last year, we expect it will still be substantial for the full year 2024 at $1 billion or more based on our current M&A expectations for the rest of the year. And as we mentioned, Q1 is our seasonally smallest free cash flow quarter. 
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. 
Michael Zaremski: Congrats, Christa. On the NFP deal closing, is there anything we should be aware of in terms of the shares and will be issuing and to the owners of NFP and whether there's like a lockup or expected sale of those shares over time given how a large amount it is? 
Christa Davies: Thanks very much for the question. And we did issue the 19 million shares yesterday. So that occurred and we haven't disclosed anything related to the MDP lockup. What we can say is the NFP management team did receive a meaningful amount of Aon shares and the purchase agreement refers to their lockup period. And we have spent time with our new investors, and they're really excited about the Aon story and appreciate how the acquisition furthers our Aon United strategy and are particularly excited about the 3x3 plan to. 
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Got it. My follow-up is also on the NFP deal. Now that it's closed, the math you gave when the deal was announced on the interest expense appear to bake in a slightly higher interest rate level in our -- it looks like than current interest rates. And just given cost of capital, it's actually even a bit higher today. What does it also kind of incentivize Aon to pay down the debt faster as well than you guys thought maybe a few months ago when the deal was announced? 
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question, Mike. And so if you look at the financials, we've outlined the synergies and deal financials, what you'll observe with the interest expense is, when we originally announced this in December, we had $230 million of interest expense in the stub period, which at the time was a 6-month stub period and we now have $285 million in that period, and it's really a result of the extra months. 
 Interest is actually at a lower average interest rate. We had originally forecast the average interest rate on the $7 billion of debt to be 6.5% it's now 5.7% so a whole 80 basis points less. So the interest rate is less, but you've got 2 more months. And then you can see that the interest expense in the future years, 2025 and 2026 is coming down from our original estimate. So the $310 million we now have in 2025 compared to the $410 million we had before and the $275 million compares to the $340 million. So you can see how the lower interest rates are impacting those future years. 
Operator: Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. 
Elyse Greenspan: My first question, I was hoping to get more color just on why the new business was down year-over-year in the U.S. specifically versus other regions? And Greg, I know you called out some business lines, but can you just help us think about how that might rebound from here? 
Gregory Case: I appreciate the question, Elyse. Start overall globally, very strong profile across the board, as we said before, both on retention, exceptionally high and on new business overall. All we just did is highlight a couple of areas in the U.S. where we're seeing some pressure. And that's really what we're showing up. That will rebound over time as we continue to talk to clients about the opportunities they've got to -- as they think about their overall programs in terms of where they are. 
 But Eric, anything you'd add to that perspective? 
Eric Andersen: Yes. Great. I mean you talked about D&O in particular, but I would also say we've had some really solid growth in areas like energy and construction and other places where we're investing in talent to grow our capabilities there. That's the sector piece, but we're also investing in geographic areas called Continental Europe, Asia Pacific, where we're also seeing good growth. So I think we will see great opportunity for us as we go forward through the year. 
Elyse Greenspan: And then in terms of the transactional, the M&A and the SPAC and the IPO business, I guess, how would the Q1 compare, right, that's been a business, that's been a headwind for you guys right over the last 6, 7 quarters. How would -- have you started to see any of that business come back? Or would you still say we're close to trough levels there? 
Eric Andersen: So Elyse, I don't think there's anybody on the planet that looks at it closer than us as we've been watching it. We hear people talk of green shoots. But the reality is, and I think we've said it on the past that our opportunity happens when the deals close and so at this point, you hear things in the market about dry powder and people wanted to do transactions. But at this point, it's still fairly depressed. 
Gregory Case: I think what we would say, Elyse, as Eric described, we see the pipeline. We love it. It looks very strong, but we don't count it anymore. We count it when it's done, and that's what we're going to do. And we see the opportunity, but we're going to count on when it's done. 
Elyse Greenspan: And then one more on the margin side, you gave the baseline, Christa, 30.6% for this year. I know in the past, you'll typically point to your historical kind of 80 to 90 basis points of margin improvement annually. Is that the right way to think about the improvement off of the 30.6% given the puts and takes of fiduciary investment income savings and then just leverage against your revenue growth? 
Christa Davies: So Elyse, the 30.6% is absolutely the right starting point, to 2024 margin expansion. We don't give specific guidance. What we do say is we're committed to margin expansion each and every year, including 2024 of that 30.6% margin base. But all the drivers still hold. We're driving margin expansion due to organic revenue growth, portfolio mix shift and synergies and efficiencies from Aon Business Services. 
Operator: Our next question is from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. 
David Motemaden: Just wanted to hear your guys' opinion on the potential FTC ban of noncompetes. And what sort of impact that might have on your business and specifically on the acquisition economics of NFP. 
Gregory Case: I'll start overall. First, Dave, I appreciate the question. This is not something that we generally enter into, particularly in the U.S., where obviously this is going to focus on. But the macro point is really the talent question I think you're really getting at, which is fundamental. Maybe Eric can offer some thoughts on that. This is a place we live every day it's our focus. 
Eric Andersen: Yes. And I think whether it's the attrition numbers, which are historically low, whether it's our ability to attract talent into the firm, we talked a little bit before about all the different tools that we've been investing in and the culture and the team environment is all very important to keep the people. 
 So as Greg said, we don't normally enter into noncompete. So this isn't a big issue for us, but it's all the other factors that drive it. And I think you also asked a question about NFP and the colleagues there. And I would just say that -- and both Greg and Christa mentioned it in the written remarks about how excited we are to have them. I think the opportunity for us to work together to add more value to their clients, which ultimately adds more value to their colleagues who have more capabilities and more opportunities to do more with them with our content. 
 And then obviously, the scale that we get from ABS, whether it's efficiency or the ability to deliver insights and tools and all the different aspects across health and risk, I think provide great opportunity for the NFP colleagues as they join the firm. So really excited about that, as I know everybody has been saying, and we see great opportunity going forward. 
David Motemaden: Got it. Great. That's helpful. And then just my second question. It looks like U.S. organic growth within CRS was down in the first quarter compared to being flat in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering, was there anything that got incrementally worse in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter? It feels like the pressures were kind of all, kind of consistent. So I'm just wondering what that incremental -- what's driving that incremental decline if I look at the organic growth in first quarter versus 4Q? 
Gregory Case: I appreciate it, David. From our standpoint, we're not really looking Q4 to Q1, over time, again, this is kind of an overall annual approach in terms of how we think about it. And as we said before, nothing's changed committed to mid-single digit or greater over the course of the year for our firm and fully on track to do that across our firm. So I wouldn't look for anything in particular. We highlighted a few areas because we want to call them out. 
 But listen, this is client leadership at a time when we're doubling down and investing on more client leadership. This is risk capital and human capital. This is Aon Business Services with the analyzers. And as we launch those, they have met with hugely positive client feedback and the colleague feedback in terms of what they need as well as ABS, which really enables all that, amplifies it and creates a client experience environment that's better than ever before and on top of the content. So for us, no, we feel very good about the progress in Q1 and what it means for our trajectory going forward. 
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. 
Robert Cox: I think in the previous presentation on NFP the target was for sort of similar to historical levels of total revenue growth, I think, about 14%. Are you guys still -- is that projection sort of maintained here? And are you still confident in that projection considering there could be some slowing levels of inflation or caution around the economy going forward. 
Gregory Case: Rob, maybe I'll just take a quick step back. I think it's worthwhile just reflecting on sort of the whole NFP process and getting Eric to comment on this specifically in terms of sort of as we see the opportunity is look, we just feel great about this combination. This is the $31 billion North American market in which we're vastly underway. We have an opportunity because of ABS to really go after that market in a way that's not just making us more sizable, but we think better and better is this idea of really independent and connected in the way Eric described before. 
 And I wanted to talk a bit about that. All these things sort of -- as we've spent time over the last few months with Doug and Mike and the team have been substantially reinforced. And so this is at the top line level on revenue opportunities in terms of sort of how we do it and the yield we get out of that, all these things are better. And then we reflect kind of some of the deal economics that also are better. So from our standpoint, we just see huge momentum. 
 But Eric, you've been living this with Doug and Mike and the team. Maybe comment a little bit here and address some of Rob's questions more specifically. 
Eric Andersen: Yes, I think there's 2 components. And first, just to touch on the independent and connected piece, which is such a critical part of how both the NFP team and the Aon team have been approaching this. And the independent piece is really to respect and sort of celebrate the way NFP approaches its clients locally and how the team service those clients. So really focusing in to make sure that those teams know exactly what they were doing before is what they're going to continue to do. 
 The connected part is really about 2 pieces. There's an efficiency play with our ABS platform around tech and ops and areas where we can get some cost synergy. But also more importantly, I think it's how we connect around product and capability, how we can bring our thought leadership, how we can bring structured portfolio solutions and product capability and thought leadership and get it to those teams in a way that their clients can digest it. So I think how we connect is really about content and it's a little bit about the cost synergies, but it's really a revenue play for us as we look at the middle market. 
 And I think on the growth number, there's an organic play here that we're talking a lot about. There's also an inorganic play that, as Greg mentioned in his opening remarks, their M&A pipeline and the way they approach adding organizations to NFP is really one of the strengths of the firm and something we're going to continue to work with. 
Gregory Case: And just to amplify one more piece. This is a tour to force revenue opportunity, right? That has been the focus since the jump, and that's what we've seen for the last few months. And it's both ways incredible capability we hope to be able to bring with a producer can sit across the table and do more on behalf of a client, which they just -- they're phenomenal they love. But also on our side, we're going to benefit tremendously too in the ways they approach the market and how they can help Aon. So it's just a -- we had high expectations going into the conversations. They've been exceeded over the last few months as we come together. So while we're not giving specific guidance on the growth number, this is tour to force growth. And man do we see a great opportunity here to access this very, very substantial market where we're underway, but do so in a way, again, it's not just bigger but candidly better. 
Robert Cox: Great. I appreciate the color. And then maybe as a follow-up on Transaction Solutions, I think you guys have talked about doubling down on Transaction Solutions in the past. Could you talk about exactly what that means? And have you added talent there recently and expanded your practice basically in anticipation of a rebound in M&A. 
Eric Andersen: So I would answer it in 2 ways. I think when we've talked about doubling down on it, the history of that product has historically been a PE-backed business. They were the original users of reps and warranties and tax insurance and things like that. Moving that over into the corporate space, where it's corporate to corporate has been an area that we've been investing an understanding among our client leaders as well as the subject matter experts that know that space. So we've held the team. That was the goal. 
 And I think that's what we've been saying for the last 2 years in the slowdown, knowing that at some stage, the market will come back, and we wanted to make sure the industry-leading expertise stayed with Aon. And so we continue to use them to reinforce the existing relationships that they have, while also building out a broader potential client set as M&A comes back. 
Operator: Our final question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. 
Meyer Shields: Christa, congratulations. One question on the first quarter margin. I guess if we take out fiduciary investment income and the savings, it doesn't seem -- and compare that to the same issue last year, it doesn't seem like there's been a lot of margin expansion despite the 5% organic growth. And I was hoping you could walk us through why that would be the case. 
Christa Davies: Yes. So Meyer, the way we think about margins is total margins. I know you're passing it into different components, and I understand the math. But we are -- we think about gross margins, which are substantial, and then we reinvest to deliver net margin expansion each year, which we will deliver again in 2024. And that's driven by organic revenue growth, portfolio mix shift, restructuring savings, which as you pointed, will drop to the bottom line and efficiencies for Aon Business Services and so we continue to invest in technology in Aon Business Services to drive future innovation and growth with clients. 
Meyer Shields: Okay. No, that's fair. Makes sense that gets modeled in. For reporting purposes, is NFP's organic growth going to be included in the organic growth number that you report on a consolidated basis? 
Christa Davies: Yes, it is. And so that's why we've broken out in the numbers, Meyer. The revenue from NFP in that table of 2023, by quarter by solution lines, you can add it in. And so the way you do that for revenue as you add 2 months of 2020 of Q2 of NFP plus the 3 months of Aon as your starting point for 2023 and then you grow that. And you will see the NFP numbers come through on that M&A table in our organic table. 
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks. 
Gregory Case: I don't have a lot, but I have one message I want to deliver on behalf of Eric and Christa and I. I just want to say on this very historic day for NFP and for Aon, a huge heartfelt welcome to our 7,700 new colleagues. We're just truly, truly excited to partner with you as we begin this journey together. So we're really looking forward to it, and welcome. Thanks, everybody, for joining and look forward to our next call. Take care. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It's important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We want to start with a very sincere thank you to our Aon colleagues around the world for all they've done in 2023 pivotal for our clients and support each other. As we reflect on 2023, we observed that the client demand driving our Aon United journey. Trends around increasing volatility and interconnected risk have accelerated. Specifically, we see four broad areas of focus that increase the relevance of our core business and create opportunity to deliver more value to clients. These four megatrends revolve around trade and the consequence of sustained geopolitical uncertainty. Technology, particularly the rise of AI, weather reflecting the rate of natural catastrophes and workforce where the pandemic has fundamentally impacted talent. These profound transitions described in our Global Risk Management Survey and Human Capital Trends Report require clients to both deliver against today's expectations and evolve to make better decisions on new risk and people challenges. Against that backdrop, we've taken significant steps to accelerate our Aon United strategy in ways that drove performance in 2023 and set the stage to build momentum and deliver stronger performance in 2024. Most notably, we're executing our three-by-three plan to leverage our risk capital and human capital structure and capability, embed the Aon Client leadership model across the firm and utilize Aon Business Services to set a new standard of innovation and client service. We then doubled down on this plan by announcing a $900 million investment into our business to accelerate Aon Business Services as a catalyst for the three-by-three plan and the complete workforce strategy effort to reflect our simplified and more connected go-to-market strategy. We closed the year with strong operating momentum and also took action to build upon our ABS driven capability to deliver innovative and accretive new products into the middle-market by announcing our intent to acquire NFP. NFP under the leadership of Doug Hammond and an exceptional team is the premier operating platform in the middle-market segment with tremendous client relationships and distribution. And together, we can bring stronger analytics and innovation to this space and not just capability but content that can serve the middle market like Aon Cyber Quotient Evaluation or CyQI, a proprietary platform that helps clients identify, measure and manage cyber risk. NFP's operating platform will enable quick and efficient connections to Aon Business Services content driving meaningful growth in the middle market. And we're incredibly excited about the top and bottom-line growth potential for NFP, given our complementary businesses and expected synergies and the value it will create. For Aon overall and barely one month into 2024, we already feel the momentum from these actions that's demonstrated through the client benefits of our integrated risk capital and human capital capabilities. On the risk capital side, our recent weather, climate, and catastrophe report highlights the growing frequency and severity of events around the world as clients look to manage volatility, enhance resilience and unlock opportunity. To do this, organizations must have more actionable analytics, exactly the insight we bring with risk capital through the combined power of reinsurance, commercial risk analytics and expertise for our clients. We recently saw this in action at our Annual Property symposium with over 1,000 clients in insurance markets in the room where we demonstrated a new suite of advanced analytic tools that bring together content and capability across reinsurance and commercial risk. One example is our property risk analyzer giving clients a better understanding of the risk profile in real time, which allows us to work more closely together to provide better insight into the risk mitigation options and enable them to make better decisions. From the overwhelming feedback and engagement, it's clear our clients are demanding better solutions and greater support. And because of the steps we've taken and progress we've made with Aon Business Services on products and platforms, we can develop and roll these tools out more quickly for our largest clients, and the clients of all sizes deliver efficiently at scale. Equally compelling for Human Capital, our Human Capital trends report highlights the rising importance to clients, but having a unique and differentiated value proposition for employees. We see clients facing significant rising healthcare costs and lower overall population health at a time they need to provide broad health and well-being offerings is greater than ever. We also saw attracting and retaining top talent as the fourth ranked risk in our Global Risk Management Survey. Our clients realize it's more important than ever to have a compelling strategy across health, wealth and talent needs that's delivered in an efficient way to maximize the benefit rewards offering. Together, this creates significant opportunity to work with clients to design and optimize their programs including core offerings to improve colleague health. Our operations drive workers' compensation costs, choosing optimal partners in their health model and supporting top talent is a strong employee value proposition, to ultimately maximize return on investment or their people spend. All these are examples of our three-by-three plan in action. It's human capital and risk capital delivered through our Aon Client leadership model and enabled by our Aon Business Services. These three pillars reinforce and accelerate our Aon United strategy, which has driven financial performance and gives us great confidence in our outlook. On financial performance, we delivered strong results in the quarter that contribute to full-year progress against our key financial metrics. Organic revenue growth of 7% in the quarter and 7% for the full-year was highlighted by full-year double-digit growth in reinsurance solutions and health solutions. And we've maintained strong overall growth throughout the year on top of 6% organic in the prior year. In the fourth quarter, commercial risk grew 4% organically with strength in property, casualty and construction even against the headwind communicated in prior quarters of ongoing pressure from trends in the M&A and IPO markets. Wealth solutions, organic growth of 5% in Q4 reflects strong growth in retirement, which includes growth from ongoing pension risk transfer projects and work to help clients address changing regulatory requirements. Reinsurance solutions organic growth was 14% contributing to full-year organic growth of 10% with our team closed the year strong, while also helping clients prepare for and execute an early one-one renewal. Health solutions delivered 11% organic growth, reflecting the strength around the world in the core, driven by net new business and retention, as well as strong growth in the U.S. consumer benefit solutions. This performance gives us confidence in our ability to drive ongoing growth across the portfolio, fully reflecting the strength of Aon United. For the full-year, 7% organic growth and ongoing operational improvement contributed to 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth. These strong results demonstrate our progress and momentum, as well as the power of Aon United strategy and Aon Business Services platform. This performance builds on our long-term track-record of results. Over the past 12 years, we've strengthened and accelerated organic revenue growth to mid-single digits or greater, delivered over 400 basis points of adjusted operating margin, expansion and growth in EPS and free-cash flow at 11% compounded annual rate ending 2023 with nearly $3.2 billion in free cash flow. The steps we've taken to accelerate Aon United with our three-by-three plan reinforce and strengthen our long-term financial guidance for the firm including mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth in 2024 and over the long-term, adjusted operating margin expansion over the long-term and long-term double-digit free-cash flow growth. As we've communicated initiatives like our restructuring program and expected acquisition of NFP impact this guidance in the near-term and over time, we believe these initiatives will contribute to significant ongoing shareholder value creation. More important we view the opportunity is higher over the next five years than at any time in our history. And in closing, we're pleased to report another strong year of progress against our Aon United strategy, which we're accelerating with our three-by-three plan, deliver risk capital and human capital at scale fully reinforced through Aon Business Services. Looking back on a year, we delivered accelerating growth across three or four solution lines and built momentum across the firm. Including 7% full-year organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 10% adjusted operating income growth and nearly $3.2 billion of free cash flow. Equally important, we took a series of major actions that position Aon for stronger performance in 2024 and over the coming years. Now. I would like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and long term outlook. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much Greg, and good morning everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered strong operating results in the fourth quarter to finish the year strong. In the quarter, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth. The full year 2023, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of margin expansion, 6% EPS growth and generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. In the quarter, we announced out definitive agreement to acquire leading broker NFP, enabling us to unlock the fast-growing mid-markets with Aon Business Services enabled enhanced distribution and further accelerate our Aon United strategy. The steps that we've taken around Aon Business Services now enables us to address this attractive market in a compelling way that delivers risk capital and human capital at scale to clients of all sizes. The expected acquisition of NFP builds on our long-term proven track record of strategically allocating capital at scale to high return opportunities to create long-term value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. And as Greg mentioned, we see the expected acquisition and our restructuring program, reinforcing our Aon United Strategy and our three-by-three plan. We are extremely well-positioned to build on this momentum as we head into 2024. As I reflect on our results, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 7% in Q4 and for the full-year, highlighted by double-digit organic revenue growth in Reinsurance Solutions and Health Solutions. I would note that reported revenue growth of 8% in Q4 includes this favorable impact from changes in FX of 2%, and there is no net impact from changes in FX to full-year reported revenue. I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, was $78 million in Q4 and $274 million for the full-year. If you were to include fiduciary investment income, organic revenue growth would have been 8% in both Q4 and the full-year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full-year 2024 and over the long-term. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement in Q4 with adjusted operating margins of 33.8%, an increase of 60 basis-points, driven by revenue growth, efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investment in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth. For the full-year, adjusted operating margins of 31.6% reflect margin expansion of 80 basis points. As previously communicated, there was no impact on margin from restructuring savings. Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2024 and over the long-term, as we continue our track-record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on ROIC basis. We expect restructuring savings will fall to the bottom-line and contribute to full-year adjusted operating margin expansion. Restructuring actions completed in 2023 are expected to generate $70 million of run-rate savings in 2024. At this time, we continue to expect a $100 million of run-rate savings in 2024 as we continue to execute against our plans at Aon Business Services and our business. As we've previously communicated, we conservatively modeled the expected acquisition of NFP to close mid-year 2025. While the combined adjusted operating margin will initially be lower than Aon standalone, we expect over time to continue to improve Aon's overall margins through operational improvement and the impacts from previously communicated cost synergies. Turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was flat in Q4. Operating income grew 10%, but was offset by a headwind from a higher tax-rate in the quarter and non-operating expense. For the full-year, organic revenue growth and margin expansion translated into adjusted EPS growth of 6%, overcoming a headwind from non-operating expense. I'd note, the change in other non-operating expense had a $0.15 per share or 4% unfavorable impact in Q4 and a $0.98 per share or 7% unfavorable impact for the full-year. This reflects an unfavorable impact from balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period, an increase in non-cash net periodic pension expense, as well as a gain on sale of businesses in the prior year period. Also, as noted in our earnings materials, FX translation had a favorable impact or approximately $0.03 per share in Q4 and an unfavorable impact of $0.17 per share for the full-year. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no material net translation impact results for the full-year 2024. Additionally, in 2024 we expect non-cash pension expense NOI to be $43 million, spread evenly across quarters, compared to $71 million in 2023. And as we've previously communicated based on a mid-2025 close, the expected acquisition of NFP is expected to be dilutive in 2025, breakeven to adjusted 2026 EPS and accretive in 2027 and beyond. At this time, there are no further updates on the regulatory process or deal timeline for NFP. Turning to free-cash flow, we generated $3.3 billion of free-cash flow in 2023. For the full-year, cash from operations increased $216 million Year-over-Year, or 7%, reflecting double-digit operating income growth and overall working capital optimization, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. I'd note, the negative impact to working capital, caused by temporary invoicing delays associated with the new system implementation, which we communicated last quarter persisted in Q4 and impacted our overall continued progress on working capital. Free-cash flow increased 5% as cash-flow from operations was offset in-part by a $56 million or 29% increase in CapEx. CapEx was $252 million in 2023 as we executed technology projects to drive long-term growth. Going forward, we expect CapEx to grow in-line with the business managed on a disciplined ROIC basis. Looking forward, free-cash flow will be impacted in the near-term by restructuring, higher interest expense and the expected NFP deal and integration costs. We expect to return to our trajectory of double-digit free-cash flow growth over the long-term, driven by operating income growth and a $500 million opportunity in working capital. As we contemplate the expected acquisition of NFP, the transaction strengthens our long-term free-cash flow outlook. We expect the transaction to add over $300 million of free-cash flow in 2026 and $600 million of free-cash flow in 2027. Now let me provide an update on our accelerating Aon United program which is enabling Aon Business Services and our three-by-three plan. As Greg highlighted, three-by-three plan is accelerating our Aon United strategy. We see particular opportunity around Aon Business Services as the catalyst. We are investing to standardized platforms and operations, drive data analytic-based product innovation and deliver at scale to create better tools, better experiences and greater relevance to clients and colleagues. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a $129 million of restructuring-related charges with a cash outflow of $13 million. We're pleased with the progress we made in the quarter and we've incurred 12% of total expected cash restructuring charges. The actions we've taken in 2023 are expected to generate $70 million of run-rate savings in 2024, contributing to the $100 million of cumulative savings we expect for full-year 2024. As mentioned, program savings were not material in 2023. As we've said previously, we look at the opportunity in Aon Business Services and across our client-facing capabilities. We now are delivering our strategy will result in long-term progress against our key financial metrics and will drive more value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. Turning now to capital allocation. We allocate capital based on return on capital and long-term value creation. I'd note, over time, we've driven value creation through core business results, share buyback and acquisitions. As you look historically, we have a successful track record of balancing acquisitions and dispositions of all sizes and share buyback. Given our strong outlook for free-cash flow over the long-term, we expect share repurchases to continue to remain our highest-return on capital opportunity for meaningful ongoing capital allocation. We believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the $2.7 billion of share repurchase in 2023. We expect to continue to invest organically in content and capabilities we can scale across the firm and we'll continue to assess priority as inorganic investments noting our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our global priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. Noting we ended 2023 with an ROIC of 33.1%, an increase of nearly 2,100 basis-points over the last 12 years, reflecting our track record of balancing growth and returns to create long-term value. I'd note ROIC will initially be negatively impacted after the expected acquisition of NFP. We expect it to improve over time as we execute our Aon United strategy to drive long-term value creation. Our expected acquisition of NFP is consistent with our proven capital allocation framework. It enables us to put capital to work at-scale and strengthen our free-cash flow profile in the long-term, which will continue to allocate to drive shareholder value creation. Between now and the expected close of the deal, we expect discretionary capital allocation will continue to be much more weighted towards share buyback, given the commitments we've made around NFP. Following the expected close of NFP, free-cash flow will be impacted in the near-term by deal and integration costs and higher interest expense, transaction-related debt, and as we take steps to delever our balance sheet and return metrics to levels consistent with our current credit ratings profile. Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade credit ratings. We expect to continue adding debt supported by EBITDA growth until we complete the expected acquisition of NFP and expect to maintain our current ratings. As we've previously communicated, we expect to fund the cash portion of the purchase with approximately $7 billion of new debt with $2 billion borrowed at close and $5 billion raised in 2024 across a range of maturities, subject to market conditions. Following the transaction related debt issuance in 2024, we expect to incur approximately $12.5 million of negative interest carry expense per quarter until deal close. As we previously communicated, the financing and capital management plan contemplated in this transaction is consistent with maintaining our current investment grade credit profile. We expect our credit ratios to be elevated over the 12 to 18 months post close. And we expect to bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels consistent with our credit profile, driven by substantial free cash flow generation and incremental debt capacity from EBITDA growth noting our track-record of effectively managing leverage within current ratings. In summary, in 2023, we delivered strong operational performance contributing to continued progress against our Aon United strategy. Our strong financial results and disciplined capital management enables us to return to $3.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The steps we've taken around our three-by-three plan are accelerating our Aon United strategy catalyzed by Aon Business Services and reinforced by the restructuring program and our expected acquisition of NFP. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity to continue to drive top and bottom-line results to drive value for clients, colleagues and shareholders and look forward to building on this momentum in 2024 . With that, I'll turn the call-back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question today will be coming from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Kligerman: Hi, thank you. Thank you and good morning. Kind of interested in the robust growth in both the reinsurance business, and the health solutions business, and the sustainability there. On reinsurance with 14% organic growth, was it largely driven by the capital markets and advisory? And how sustainable do you think that could be? And then on the consumer benefits solutions inside of health, what actually drove the consumer benefits solution strength?
Greg Case: Well, Andrew, let start and Eric will chime in here as well. I'll start overall, we're really pleased with how we closed the year on the growth story overall and to think about the 7% across the firm. Really strong momentum as we build into 2024. But you're right, reinsurance and health, absolutely phenomenal. Teams were absolutely terrific. And I would highlight the quarter, but also highlight the year. When you think about reinsurance across the year at 10% and health solutions at 10% double-digit, it really is a story amplified by Q4, but really across the year. And it's been highly consistent when you think about the description around the 3x3 plan and risk capital and human capital. Both of these approaches contributed to growth sort of in the context of health and reinsurance and give us great momentum as we go into 2024. But maybe Eric, a little texture on both pieces for the year and the quarter.
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg. It's a great question. And just to reaffirm, just a fantastic team operating really on fire. I would say on Q4, to go to your question, there was record cat bond issuance for the quarter, but we also had very strong growth in Treaty and Fac. So across the board, good. And I would say that the trends that we have been seeing over the last couple of years, I think have an opportunity to continue. Certainly, whether it's climate change, whether it's casualty uptick in terms of lost costs, whether it's opportunities from a profitability standpoint that, our insurers are dealing with from their own books of business. The need for data analytics, the need for capital support as a position, their primary businesses are all still there. And it's a global answer. So, we're seeing it in Europe and Asia Pacific, as well as strength in North America and the U.K. So, we're really optimistic about the business, and feel like it's really well positioned.
Greg Case: And then maybe on the health side, just a comment on the health side?
Eric Andersen: Listen, we having same thing, right? We had great wins in the core health and benefit business. And as you mentioned, the consumer business across the globe, whether led by EMEA, U.K., U.S., and it really was new logos for us on core health and benefits. I think on the consumer side, the ability to offer unique products, to the consumer part of our corporate clients, is really a strength of the firm and those products evolve. And I think they're meeting the needs of the individual consumer. And we also see that as an opportunity to continue to grow.
Andrew Kligerman: Excellent. And then just lastly, on M&A, I guess, in the slides, you talked about potentially growing organically and inorganically there. Do you think M&As are a real possibility in the next year or two, as you kind of await a conclusion on the NFP acquisition? And if you are interested in M&As what would be some of those targeted businesses where you'd like to be?
Greg Case: So let me just start overall, as Christa described, we continue to look as we think about deployment of capital, obviously buyback, it's top of the list given how undervalued we are. But we're looking across the board, even as we think about sort of the closure on the NFP front. And again, return on investment capital-based, content-based in every way, but we see opportunities around the world. And our pipeline continues to be very strong. But what else could you add from a capital allocation standpoint?
Christa Davies: I mean, reinforcing exactly what you said, Greg, we allocate capital-based return on capital. We definitely, based on the free cash flow outlook in 2024 in the long-term, see we are significantly undervalued. And we will disproportionately allocate that free cash flow, to buyback in 2024. But we do have a great M&A pipeline, Andrew, to your question, in areas like data analytics. If you think about the acquisition of Tyche, a fantastic acquisition of the data analytics space in areas like health, as Eric highlighted. And so, there are a number of areas that are front and center for clients in terms of meeting their emerging challenges.
Andrew Kligerman: And if you see the right opportunity, you wouldn't hesitate to go after it, correct?
Christa Davies: And Andrew, the thing I would say is, it's all about return on capital. And so, given how undervalued we are, buyback is the top of the list. And for us to invest in M&A, it's got to be buyback. And so, we'll continue to look at everything and there's certainly some terrific opportunities out there, but we'll continue to be very, disciplined on return on capital.
Andrew Kligerman: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Jack Matten: Hi, good morning. This is Jack on for Mike. A question on organic growth. In your footnotes, it says that organic growth benefited by 1% from a held-for-sale business and, which segment did that impact and will that have a similar impact until the business is sold?
Christa Davies: So, thanks so much for the question, Jack. We do continue to manage the portfolio actively. These are businesses that we are divesting. And so, we think about this is just a better representation of our revenue, and business going forward. It is in commercial risk and we communicated the 1% impact in Q4, and for the full-year.
Jack Matten: Got it. Thank you. And then second question, you call-out again this quarter decline in global M&A activity, as being a source of organic growth deceleration from prior periods. Would you be able to offer any color on what percentage of Aon revenues touched M&A spend, is it a big enough driver, it impacts continue negatively impacting growth given that M&A volumes are still falling by double-digit levels?
Greg Case: So Michael, let me step back, it's been a continuation of what we've talked about throughout the overall year. In terms of sort of where we are. And we would observe by the way, we help serve, we think about Q4, 2023 versus Q4, 2022 state on four and four. So it's sort of same year-over-year, even against this headwind. And we haven't disclosed sort of the detail on sort of the impact, but it's substantial. We've got an amazing group of colleagues, who serve this marketplace and as Eric had mentioned before on prior calls. We have doubled down and this capability. We fully anticipate this is going to come back in absolute full force. The amount of dry powder out there as you know well is extensive. We remind you it shows up in our organic, when the deal is complete. And we see lots of - we see lots of things in the pipeline as it sort of things are coming to pass. And we fully expect over the course of 2024 to see a return. But this is meaningful for us and we've been able to work at very, very strongly and maintain growth across-the-board even at the face of the segment. But Eric, what else would you add to that.
Eric Andersen: Greg, I think you described it perfectly, just maybe one little bit of color. This week, for example, we held a conference where we had 400 members of the private-equity community, the corporate M&A, Corp Dev teams, the insurance markets, the reps and warranties, tax indemnity, and we essentially were going through the marketplace. Just from a growth standpoint, but also from a product innovation standpoint, recognizing that as the deals return and they will. We want to make sure we're well situated with the clients with the markets, making sure the products are fit-for-purpose, and are evolving to meet the needs, not just here in the US, but in Europe and other places. Where, when it returns we have made that commitment, we want to hold the team so that, we're ready and front and center when the deals start to happen.
Jack Matten: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So first, just following-up on the whole M&A discussion. It seems like capital markets activity, is beginning to pick-up and the investment banks are seeing that across-the-board. So, wondering if you're seeing any signs of that in your business as well, or is it more your hope that things will pick-up in 2024, but you haven't seen any of it?
Greg Case: Jimmy, we're seeing exactly the same thing you're seeing and you're hearing about. You can imagine, this is a market where highly connected to, with clients and with all the banks, and everyone else involved in the process. And I would say there's high expectations everywhere, you'd only listened to the Investment Bank our quarterly calls, to sort of understand that. And so, we certainly see lots of potential. And as Eric described, the amount of capital on the sidelines ready to return is high and we're incredibly well-positioned to do that. But I would say, as I mentioned before, it shows up in organic for us as the deals were completed. And so, as you see that move, you can expect it's going to be fully reflected in our performance.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on commercial brokerage, the organic growth of 4%, I think you mentioned double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, which is obviously good, but it also suggests that the U.S. is very weak and maybe close to flat. Which seems a little odd given GDP growth, pricing and also just strength that, other brokers have reported. So what's really going on in the U.S. that's, pressuring the growth to being flat, despite some of the tailwinds in the economy overall?
Greg Case: Yes. I would start overall, your overall assertion continue where you're getting to, but really doesn't reflect what's going on in reality. Obviously the business is a very, very different sizes. So, one doesn't really offset the other in any way, shape or form. We would come back to the overall commercial risk story, is exactly what we described before, which is, listen, we are exactly where we were in Q4 of last year with an emerging headwind and became a substantial headwind. We overcame that and a lot of this is not just commercial risk, but the connection of commercial risk reinsurance, and risk capital. And we closed the year, we'd observed some others in the market seem to be retreating. We're not retreating at all, 12% versus 12% of last year and we're going into '24, with a lot of momentum. So, we're very excited about the overall prospects, as we move into 2024. And maybe Eric talk a little bit about the risk capital implications of all this is coming together, and the potential around it?
Eric Andersen: Yes, sure Greg. I think certainly strong retention, strong new business, both in North America and around the world and the commercial risk business is important. But maybe I'll use it as an opportunity to show the connectivity between sort of the risk capital framework. And maybe I'll talk about the cat bonds that, I know you wanted to get some airtime on. We did the first-ever cyber cat bond in the quarter, which was a great opportunity for the - for our team working with one of our insurance company clients, to take the systemic cyber risks and get it into the capital markets, which does two things. It actually allows the insurer to open up the amount of limit they provide the clients, which was something that our clients were looking for. And it also appropriately values in places that type of systemic risk into the right capital source. But the point of it is, we were then able to take that ILS structure, using the data and analytics that we did to build it, and used it to do an ILS structure for one of the largest corporates in Europe who was looking for traditional sort of cyber program, but wasn't able to get the limit they wanted. So, taking something that we did for an insurer, using the data and analytics and structuring, bringing it to a large corporate and maybe finishing it, because Greg I know you mentioned NFP in your opening comments just to tie it through, able to take the same data and analytics that we use to build the cat bond and the corporate structure to actually power the side [ph] cue product that is built for the middle-market, which then attaches a risk transfer product to it. So, again using data and analytics on one topic, just cyber actually to drive growth in reinsurance in commercial risk and ultimately in the middle-market, part of the commercial risk segment. So, that's what's driving the retention. That's what's driving the strong new business, and I think those opportunities exist for us across multiple areas.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.
Bob Huang: Hi, good morning. First question is about the Vesttoo legal settlement. Can you talk about how much of the $197 million is likely to be the full extent of the impact? In other words in the press release, you obviously mentioned there is the potential of some of that been sent back to you. What's the progress of that? Can you maybe give a little bit more detail of how confident you are that, some of the $197 million will be paid back to Aon?
Greg Case: Listen - I would just open by saying that we strategically wanted to draw a line under this issue for our market partners and for ourselves. So that we were able to move forward together as partners. And so, the effort was made to come to an agreement with each of the affected parties, sorry. So that we could then continue to both one trade forward. But then also begin to work on recoveries together. And so, we see an opportunity for recoveries that will happen over-time, as the bankruptcy process runs its way through. And we're confident that we'll be able to recover meaningful amount.
Bob Huang: Okay. Thank you. Second question is on cash flow. I understand that you kind of mentioned this a little bit. Is that - on your slides, you remove the double-digit growth for the near-term, but reiterate at a long-term guidance for free cash flow. I'm assuming that it's fair to say that is mainly due to the NFP acquisition over the next two years. Is that safe to assume that like is that the reason and can you maybe give a little bit more context in terms of, how you're thinking about free cash flow guidance going-forward?
Christa Davies: Yes, thanks so much for the question. So firstly, I'd reiterate your point, which is we are incredibly confident in the long-term free cash flow growth of double-digits. I'm extremely excited about how NFP accelerates the long-term free cash flow growth of Aon, adding $300 million in free cash flow in 2026 and $600 million free cash flow in 2027. And look, as we think about free cash flow in 2024, we haven't given specific guidance. But here's how I think about it. We expect to grow free cash flow driven by operating income growth and improvements in working capital. We do expect ongoing cash tax headwinds. We've communicated the restructuring program, but we haven't given specific guidance around the timing of the cash impact, and we've talked about the impacts of NFP. We don't expect to incur material costs before close. And we've said, we would expect to incur $12.5 million of negative interest carry expenses per quarter until deal close following the transaction-related debt issuance. We said CapEx will grow in-line with the business from $252 million in 2023. We've communicated legal settlements and as Eric just said, expect those to flow through over the next several years known - there will be meaningful recoveries. Ultimately, we expect to deliver underlying free cash flow growth. And we're targeting double-digits as we move past the negative impact of restructuring and NFP, very excited about the long-term double-digit free cash flow trajectory of Aon. Lastly in 2024, we do expect a disproportionate, majority of the free cash flow to be allocated to buyback given we're operating on a return on capital basis, and we are substantially undervalued today.
Bob Huang: Really appreciate the color. Thank you for reiterating that. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.
Rob Cox: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just first question on, one of the higher growth areas of insurance, and thinking about the higher growth areas, one of those is currently the E&S space. And I was just curious on how Aon thinks internally about the feasibility of owning a wholesale broker, and is there any reason, to think that could potentially be a good fit?
Eric Andersen: Maybe I'll take a stab at that one. Thanks for the question. Listen, there's been explosive growth in the wholesale market over the last or the E&S market over the last five to seven years. They are on the magnitude of tenfold, there's a lot that's driving and, whether it's the lawsuit. But you see in the property market, whether it's regulatory pressure on pricing and forms and there's a lot to it. We have consolidated our wholesale relationships. So that we're actually working in partnership to get access, to those to that capital when we needed for our clients. Some of our competitors do own wholesalers and that's the way they chose, to enter into the marketplace. So it's something we always looked at, but we like where we are today. And we like the. We like the relationships that we have with our major partner [ph] as we need. That marketplace tends to flex up and down with different market cycles. And so, I would say right now, it is based on the challenging market conditions, especially in the property area. It's significant, a significant growth, but it will ebb and flow overtime.
Rob Cox: Got it. Appreciate that. And maybe just a follow-up on pricing. I think some of the other brokers have talked about expectations for fairly stable P&C pricing in 2024. I'm curious if Aon shares that view, if there is any other color you'd want to add-on the pricing trajectory?
Eric Andersen: So I think a number of people have commented on it during this earning season. I would say that we're probably heading towards a market where it's more of a series of markets where you see price competitive - price competitiveness in certain areas, where new capital has drawn in D&O for example, would be one that's been called out. You also see challenges still in certain parts of property and people are a little worried about casualty as social inflation from nuclear verdicts have kind of hit the wires. And they're worried about prior year reserves. So, I think rather than just a rising market for all what we're going to see over '24 and '25, it's going to be very product specific and very risk specific, which is something that I think plays well to us, because it allows to use our teams in our analytics, to able to help them think through, how they either want to trade, or manage the risks. And so, but I think that's where we see the market going in '24 and '25.
Greg Case: I maybe just add Rob as well, if you think about impact as it relates to our overall performance bringing it back to Aon. We've talked about mid-single-digit or greater. We don't see anything changing that view. Again, pricing is one aspect, we talked about market impact which includes insured values in a number of other pieces that, fit into the equation. Our ability to work with clients in any type of marketplace than our advantage in doing so. And so, our view is, market will be, what it will be a series of markets as Eric just described. But our ability to deliver mid-single-digit or greater. We feel like, we're going into '24 with a lot of momentum behind.
Rob Cox: Appreciate that thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks, good morning. I wanted to come back to commercial risk. You guys said. I guess there was a 1% impact of business that you put out in dispositions in the quarter overall, right. So that would imply if it impacted commercial risk that, was 2% of the segment, which would bring your organic 2% before that adjustment. And I know you've highlighted the M&A and the SPAC [ph] and the IPO slowdown. And I think Greg in response to one of your question. You pointed that the U.S. probably would not have been flat, right, that there's if we couldn't really back into that. But what is actually impacting commercial risk away from the M&A and SPAC business that aside from this disposition, the growth would have been 2%?
Greg Case: Christa, you might be on mute.
Christa Davies: Oh sorry. So, Elyse one of the things I wanted to clarify, was on the held-to-sale item, it is across a couple of solution lines and we didn't disclose the specifics. But we are divesting this business. And so, we think it's a much better presentation of our organic revenue growth, and the go forward business. And then as we continue to describe, the major impact on commercial risk is the M&A and IPO environment. And that has remained depressed and Eric and Greg have outlined how they see that recovering in 2024, but Eric, would you like to add anything here?
Eric Andersen: Christa, the only thing I would add, I mentioned it before, is stronger business growth, strong retention, and rollover for our clients in North America and around the world. So, the underpinnings of the business continue to be very strong.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then as we - one question. I had on reinsurance, right. Obviously to lower volume quarter. And we went through kind of what drove the growth in the fourth quarter. As we think about the Q1 and '24, right. We've heard about the renewals, it January 1 being good, but right obviously, price increases came down, because they were so strong last year. How do we think about reinsurance organic growth in a still strong, but decelerating price increase environment?
Eric Andersen: Maybe I'll take that one, Greg. Listen, I think there was certainly adequate capital to get the client needs done for the one-one renewals then that's predominantly Europe and parts of North America, recognizing the Florida and Asia-Pacific tend to be April and June of the year. I would also say, part of the risk capital strategy is how do, we actually deploy reinsurance capability into either commercial risk or new sectors. And so, I'll just to give you an example. It's kind of early days, but I spent some time in Dubai at the COP conference, and we spent a lot of time working with various government entities, around how you bring reinsurance structure and capability, to help mitigate the effects of climate - changing climate. And so, that is core reinsurance data analytics structurally and global access to capital, to a whole new sector of potential clients. And so, I do think it's certainly the main of the business continues to be serving insurance companies. But there is opportunity outside of that space, to drive new growth for us in what you would consider core reinsurance capability. So that Elyse and you think about FAC, you think about investment banking ILS markets and being able to use that capital for corporates. And so, it's a very creative group that is well-coordinated with our commercial risk clients in the risk capital framework. And so, we do see opportunities for continued growth in that space over the coming period.
Greg Case: I would add Elyse though, the momentum of this team in the core space, reinsurance, more broadly across risk capital, has been tremendous. And obviously, the quarter-by-quarter view is helpful. But we look at the annual view. If you think about kind of 10% for the year. That's what's really unique not saying where we're going to be next year. Other than mid-single-digit, or greater across the solution lines, which is what we - which we aspire to. And so, I think you can take away you've just heard on commercial risk momentum into 2024 and clearly as you look at reinsurance momentum into 2024, for all the reasons that Eric described in the core solution lines, but also in risk capital, don't lose this, this risk capital orientation is a big deal. It is meaningful in terms of sort of what we're doing the same on the human capital side. The connectivity across reinsurance or commercial risk creates better solutions, Eric described a couple of them already. And so for us, we feel good about the momentum going into 2004 based on the work we did the groundwork we laid in '23, on risk capital and human capital.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then one more the savings. I know, Christa, you reaffirmed on the $100 million for '24, it doesn't sound like there were any that came through in the fourth quarter. So. I guess we'll start seeing the savings flow through in the first-quarter, is that correct?
Christa Davies: That's correct. Elyse.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. So, Greg. And because we've been very consistent about the impact of a slow M&A and IPO market on organic growth. Wanted to take a step back and say. How do you think about the fact that organic growth, is so dependent on one segment of the marketplace that you ended-up with this differentiated results relative to peers. Is that a concern?
Greg Case: Well, if you step back, Meyer. You can step-back and say, look at the overall performance of the firm year-over-year in essence we are up to the year 6%, last year, 7% this year across the firm. We think about commercial risk. Again, we are 4% in Q4 last year was 4% in Q4 this year, even against a substantial headwind we described. And what we want you to understand in the context of that, is imagine all the things sort of behind that created that momentum in Q4 and our 2024 in the commercial risk space. We've overcome that and maintain where we were last year. So, we're very optimistic about the momentum in 2024. This category is substantial in M&A and we love it, and we are disproportionately good at it. We are unbelievably good at it from a client leadership standpoint. And so, we don't feel bad about that in the least. We love it, and we're going to double down on it. But we also continue to build-out other platforms. This year given us the opportunity to really think that through and really leverage the risk capital orientation. I would highlight I mentioned in my comments, the Property Symposium. We got a 1,000 clients and markets in the room and we bring up the property risk analyzer. And this is really a function of reinsurance, and commercial risk analytics and the power of that in the minds of a client were substantial. And so, now we've got a suite of capabilities that are going to contribute to the commercial risk and the reinsurance, as we head into 2024. So from our standpoint, what you really like you to take away and certainly our feeling and commitment is mid-single-digit or greater, the translation into OI margin improvement and as Christa described the translation into double-digit free cash flow growth. We have - never had more conviction about each of those three categories and on our delivery knows and will continue to deliver those. And the addition of NFP is only going to strengthen our free cash flow profile over time. So for us, we're always going to be cautious in our approach, but resolute and we feel very good about the momentum going into 2024.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Second question, when we look at the strong organic growth in reinsurance. Looking at the breakdown. I think you talked about pretty facultative and investment banking. Is that component of revenues positive, or negative to overall margin?
Christa Davies: So reinsurance is a similar margin business to all of our businesses, which is why we operate Aon as one segment Meyer. And one of the things we would say, part of our Aon United strategy is, we are bringing together a lot of the back-office technology, operations and shared service functions into Aon Business Services, which is enabling our focus on common and shared operations, technology platforms at scale, and then product innovation at-scale. And so, we're really operating more-and-more the firm in one segment with risk capital, human capital, enterprise client and Aon Business Services.
Greg Case: And Meyer, this is Greg, this is really a great question and really work point of high emphasis. This connectivity that Christa is describing risk capital, human capital connected through, enterprise client, delivered an amplified by Aon Business Services, a big deal. Our ability to continue to drive margin improvement as we did this year with lots of investments into the business is high. And the exciting piece is connectivity on Aon Business Services, 15,000 colleagues working this interconnected into the business, is not just continued margin improvement, which you saw, but also the capability to really create outcomes that really drive clients innovation options that they didn't have before as well as service enhancements, they didn't have before. And so, these pieces all come together to sort create this integrated view, which really give us great confidence around not only top-line growth, but also margin improvement and the implications on free cash flow.
Meyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Charlie Lederer with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.
Charlie Lederer: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess, first question, as we've seen some reserving issues in casualty and financial lines across the industry. Wondering if this were to become a more widespread issue for the industry. Could that impact Aon's profit commissions and that material enough that it would impact your margins are organic growth near-term?
Greg Case: So I'll say, we don't do the profit commission. So that's not true for us. And so that's not in our portfolio. But I would say in terms of what's happening in that marketplace, I do think it does reflect some pressure that the insurers are seeing, especially on the casualty side. I would say on the financial line side, it's probably more a question of just supply and demand where a lot of new capital into the market as company. [technical difficulty] yes you just seeing price competition versus any prior loss problems. But I think the casualty piece with medical inflation they call it social inflation, is affecting their prior reserves. So, but it will not have an impact on us from that perspective.
Charlie Lederer: Got it, thanks. And then on the commercial risk segments. Just wondering it as deal volumes come back eventually, does that carry a higher margin where that would help your margins, as that becomes a larger proportion of the mix again?
Greg Case: Again. I would just reinforce the point Charlie around sort of as Christa described overall margin, our ability to sort of drive margin across the firm. We've got a very long track-record of being able to do that over the last decade plus. And we have enhanced our ability to do that with Aon Business Services. And so, we are excited about adding growth as it also helps us deliver on margin. You don't see us really make that trade-off. We really do both. And in the profile is ahead of us to do exactly that. And we would absolutely see as our 3x3 plan fits together, but M&A is going to be and IPO is going to be a fundamental part of that, and we're excited to have that growth come back.
Charlie Lederer: Got it, thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Jimmy Bhullar: Great, thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around the expected timing of the close of the NFP deal. Is mid-2025, what do you realistically think the deal will close, or is it just more given the uncertainty, you don't want to over promise. Because it seems like it's a long-lead time for a deal that really, in my view, doesn't entail a lot of antitrust or other issues, given the market focus of NFP, but...?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question. And we agree, we operate in very different segments, with very limited overlap and we fully expect to close in mid '24, we have modeled the deal very conservatively with a mid '25 close. And that is off being conservative financially.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. But in terms of - and then in terms of sort of processes are there areas there is some overlap, but we can see from the outside. Or do you not think there is going to be anything related, to potential dispositions in order to get the deal approved?
Christa Davies: So, Aon and NFP operate in highly competitive markets. And most importantly, the purpose of this transaction is to grow Aon's presence in the fast growing middle-market segment. And so, we do not see overlap and we again expect the deals closed mid '24.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: Thanks very much. I would like to add a couple of thoughts as we close today, just picking up Eric and Christa, on some of the comments that have been made throughout the call, which has been very, very helpful. Just reiterate a couple of things. First reflect on the track-record we've had delivering on the strategic initiatives and external commitments and think about it included in a number of significant acquisitions and divestitures. And a history of successfully executing around the restructuring programs, and that brings us to where we are today, which you can tell from our enthusiasm we're very excited about. You think about the 3x3 plan each component of our strategy and the execution plan here, are fully aligned totally connected. If you think about Eric described today risk capital and human capital and the capability that comes together with that, the client response of this has been exceptional. As we continue to build that it's now connected completely, through our ability to deliver that into the field, enterprise clients and Aon client leadership model fully connected. And this amplification on Aon Business Services came up a few times today. We'd encourage you to really dig in and understand the power of what this really means 15,000 colleagues in this group well beyond the efficiency that Christa described, which you saw in '23 OI margin of 31.6%. It's really the ability to deliver better content in a better service experience that, combination really is extremely it's exciting for us in terms of what it means for Aon, and for our clients. And as Eric described it really you think about sort of NFP, the opportunity in NFP is there, because of their great capability and awesome operating platform and our Aon Business Services capability. And again we bring all that together with the $900 million investment to accelerate that do that over three years across the 3x3 plan with what do we are taking more time. So, I just want to highlight as the questions come together, we really connected in our mind and really put us in a unique position, to execute against our overall plan and deliver great momentum in '24, '25 and '26. So just want to end with a summary, and say thanks to everyone for being part of the call today. And look forward to our discussion next time.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-27 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.  It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2023 results, as well as having been posted on our website. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc.
Greg Case: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. As we begin the call today, we'd like to take a moment to reflect on the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza. We condemn violence anywhere that occurs in the world and remain highly concerned about all in harm's way. The safety and well-being of our colleagues and their families is always our top priority. And our team is in constant contact with our leaders in Israel to ensure our colleagues, their families, and our clients have our full support. As we reflect on the quarter, we want to start with a huge thank you to our Aon colleagues around the world for all they do every day to support each other and to support our clients. Turning to financial performance. We delivered strong results in the quarter that contribute to year-to-date progress against our key financial metrics. Organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter was highlighted by double-digit growth in reinsurance solutions and health solutions. Year-to-date 7% organic revenue growth and ongoing operational improvement have contributed to 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth a strong performance. In our solution lines. Reinsurance solutions delivered another very strong quarter of 11% organic revenue growth with strong growth across Treaty Fac and our Strategy and Technology Group. In addition to delivering a strong quarter, our team is already helping clients prepare for the 2024 renewals. Health solutions also delivered another very strong quarter with 10% organic revenue growth as our team continued to drive strong new and renewal business. We see ongoing focus from clients to address underlying trends impacting their workforce and health care costs such as medical and wage inflation, population health, focus on well-being and overall talent engagement. Within wealth solutions, organic growth of 4% reflected strength in retirement as our teams continue to sell clients with pension risk transfer and regulatory change. Finally, commercial risk organic revenue growth of 4% reflected strong renewals and net new business with strength internationally in EMEA and the Pacific. However, overall organic revenue growth was negatively impacted by the external M&A and IPO markets as we communicated previously. Today we're also excited to announce actions to go further faster on Aon United and we will describe our plan and our restructuring program will accelerate key elements of our strategy. As always, our actions are driven by client need. For our clients the difficult reality of the current world is evident everywhere as they face increasing challenges, understanding, measuring and dealing with risk. Our forthcoming Global Risk Management survey details this trend with input from over 3,000 public and private clients of all sizes across geographies and industries. Trade, Technology, Weather and Workforce Stability are simple forces in today's risk landscape. While each of these forces are individually impacting risk exposures, the increase in connectivity is compounding complexity and presenting new challenges to business leaders. Responding to our clients' increasing and evolving demand, they'll protect and build their business we are advancing a series of actions to further accelerate our Aon United strategy. These actions taken over the next three years, will deliver outcomes that directly address client needs and demand. Specifically, we will improve the quality and availability and analytic tools available to clients, substantially improve their service experience and expand the quality and scope of solutions we bring to them. This work will put our clients in a much stronger position to make better decisions to support their companies. We will accomplish this by delivering on three commitments over the next three years. Internally, we call this 3x3 plan. The three commitments include: first, leveraging our risk capital and unit capital structuring capability to unlock new integrated solutions across our core business, but also address new requirements in client demand. Second, embedding the Aon client leadership model across our enterprise clients in large and middle market segments to further strengthen and expand our client relationships; and third, accelerating Aon business services plan to set a new standard for service delivery and next-generation analytic tools. The benefits of this plan accrue to our colleagues, our clients and our shareholders. Colleagues win with greater capability to serve clients. Today our team is exceptional in their client leadership focus and impact, and this work provides them with next-generation tools and capability to serve clients and to meet increasing client demand. Clients win with better solutions and better service. This work resets client service to a higher standard and provides analytic tools and solutions required to meet demand, and investors win through our greater client relevance continuing margin improvement and sustained double-digit free cash flow growth. And while we could have achieved these benefits over time, we have instead decided back now and accelerate a proven strategy. Let me describe where our team came to this conclusion. The last 10-plus years have demonstrated that a more connected firm is a more capable firm, and the connecting Aon is a done in concept that's accomplished through meaningful structural change, which must be embraced and led by colleagues. It is cultural and only viable as a defining part of our DNA. And even though we remain on a journey, with plenty of distance to travel and opportunity ahead to improve, we have made progress and the results have been meaningful for clients in terms of innovation and support, for colleagues in the form of excitement and engagement currently at an all-time high and for shareholders measured by sustainable value creation including, a 30.8% full year 2022 operating margin compound free cash flow growth of 13% a year from 2010 to 2022 and return on invested capital at year-end 2022 of 30.6%. However, two observations give us conviction that going further faster is a requirement. The first, is increasing client demand. And the second is, our execution confidence based on our proven track record the 3x3 action plan we have defined and the diligent work already underway. Accelerating our plan requires greater upfront investment. And as announced in our press release, we will execute this through a $900 million restructuring program, focused on two areas. First, is on accelerating our Aon Business Services plan by focusing on standardized operations integrating operating platforms and driving product innovation. And the second is, on workforce planning to align skills and capability required to deliver on the digital first opportunity embedded in AI business services as well as workforce changes to strengthen our client-serving capability and risk capital and human capital. This investment will also drive $350 million of cumulative annual run rate savings by year-end 2026, which Christa will describe in more detail. Overall, our team is very excited about the opportunity to accelerate our plans to strengthen client leadership and fortunate that we have the opportunity and options to take this step as a direct result of the work of our colleagues. We continue to expect to drive mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth over the course of 2023 and the long-term. We further expect these savings will contribute to ongoing annual margin expansion. And while the program will impact free cash flow in the near-term, over the long-term, we expect to continue to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth driven by operating income and working capital improvements. In summary, our strong year-to-date operational performance, including 7% organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and 10% adjusted operating income growth, demonstrates strong momentum against our Aon United strategy. It creates the opportunity for us to double down on our strategic commitments around risk capital, human capital, our client leadership model, and Aon Business Services. These steps will enable us to continue to address evolving client demand, improve colleague outcomes, and continue our track record of long-term shareholder value creation. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and long-term outlook. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much Greg and good morning everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered strong operating results in the third quarter and year-to-date. Through the first nine months of the year, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 80 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth. These results position us very well to continue driving results in 2023 and over the long-term. We look forward to building on this momentum as we head into the last quarter of the year. As I reflect on our performance year-to-date, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 6% in Q3 and 7% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long-term. I would also note that reported revenue growth of 10% in Q3 includes a favorable impact from changes in FX of 2%, primarily driven by a weaker US dollar versus most currencies, compared to the prior year period. Reported revenue growth of 7% year-to-date includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX 1%, primarily driven by a stronger US dollar versus most currencies compared to the prior year period. I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, with $80 million in Q3 and $196 million year-to-date or 3% of total revenue in Q3 and 2% of total revenue year-to-date. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement through the first nine months of the year with adjusted operating margins of 30.8% an increase of 80 basis points driven by revenue growth, efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth. We translated double-digit adjusted operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 15% in Q3 and 8% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings material, FX had an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.01 per share in Q3 and an unfavorable impact of $0.20 per share year-to-date. If currency remains stable at today's rates, we would expect a favorable impact of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter, totaling an unfavorable impact of $0.17 per share for the full year 2023. I'd also note the change in other nonoperating expense had a $0.15 per share or 7% unfavorable impact in Q3 and a $0.59 per share or 6% unfavorable impact year-to-date. This reflects an unfavorable impact from an increase in non-cash net periodic pension expense, as well as balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period and a gain on sale of businesses in the prior year period. Turning to free cash flow. Cash flow from operations decreased $3 million year-over-year, reflecting double-digit operating income growth, offset in part by higher cash tax payments as we mentioned previously and the negative impact to working capital in the third quarter caused by temporary invoicing delays associated with the implementation of a new system. Free cash flow decreased 4% to approximately $2 billion, primarily driven by a $77 million increase in CapEx. CapEx was elevated in the first nine months of the year compared to the prior year period as we executed a number of technology projects to drive long-term growth. And net CapEx could be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and we expect CapEx to moderate in the fourth quarter to total CapEx investment of $220 million to $250 million in 2023. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments on a disciplined ROIC basis and we expect it to grow the business going forward. Now let me share more details about our accelerating Aon United program. As Greg highlighted, we are doubling down on three strategic commitments, including accelerating Aon Business Services, which in turn enables us to unlock advancers in risk capital and human capital and our Aon Client Leadership strategy. Together, these commitments will drive more value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. The investment to accelerate our three-year Aon Business Services operating model focuses on the same three areas we've mentioned previously. We see proven benefit and will now accelerate. Number one standardized operating operations; number two integrating operating platforms; and number three increasing product innovation and development. We've already made considerable progress in standardizing our operations but we see significant opportunity both within and across our solution lines. The work we're doing to standardize operations will drive integrated service delivery platforms, which provide additional opportunities to standardize how we do business, and standard operations combined with integrated platforms enables more effective new product development and innovation at scale. By accelerating standardization across the portfolio and establishing fewer more integrated platforms, we'll be able to deliver more analytical tools to colleagues and clients across the entire portfolio. With this underlying infrastructure in place, we'll be able to leverage advances in AI and machine learning to further accelerate the product development cycle and unlock new efficiencies across the portfolio. Let me provide a bit more financial detail about the strategic investment. We expect total annual in-year savings of $350 million to be achieved in 2026, contributing to ongoing sustainable long-term margin expansion. I'd note we expect savings to ramp over time with annual Indian savings expected to be $100 million in 2024, $250 million in 2025 and $350 million in 2026. We do not expect material savings or impacts to cash flow in 2023. Cash restructuring charges of $900 million reflects the savings ratio of 2.6 times and a largely to technology costs and workforce optimization. I'd note you can think of the $900 million cash restructuring charge as less than 10% of underlying free cash flow over the next three years and the $350 million of savings as a 4% cost takeout relative to our cost base of approximately $9 billion. We also expect an additional $100 million of non-cash charges, largely related to asset and lease impairments. We do not expect significant incremental CapEx associated with the program and we expect CapEx will grow in line with the business in the future from our guidance of $220 million to $250 million in 2023. In the third quarter of 2023, we incurred $6 million of restructuring charges and we'll communicate charges and savings going forward each quarter. Contemplating the program, as we look forward we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long-term. We expect program savings will contribute to ongoing sustainable long-term margin expansion and expect to deliver margin expansion in 2023, 2024 and over the long-term. As we've noted previously, over the last 12 years we've delivered 1,120 basis points of margin expansion or about 90 basis points a year on average. Our outlook for free cash flow remains strong. We expect to deliver high single-digit free cash flow in 2023. I'd note this guidance contemplates the impact from restructuring on free cash flow in Q4 so we do not expect restructuring to have a material impact on cash flow this year. While free cash flow will be reduced in the near-term by restructuring we expect to return to our trajectory of double-digit free cash flow growth over the long-term driven by operating income growth and ongoing working capital improvements. As we've said previously, as we look at the opportunity in Aon Business Services and across our client-facing capability we know that delivering this strategy will result in long-term progress against our key financial metrics: organic revenue growth margin expansion and free cash flow growth. Now turning to capital allocation. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today highlighted by nearly $2 billion of share repurchase year-to-date. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities that we can scale to address unmet client needs. Our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our global priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to clients growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile and expect to add incremental debt as EBITDA grows over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade credit profile. In summary, our strong financial results in the quarter and year-to-date reflect strong operational performance driven by our Aon United strategy and our Aon Business Services platform. We see an opportunity to accelerate the next stage of our Aon United strategy and expect this investment will contribute to sustainable long-term top and bottom line growth and ongoing shareholder value creation. With that I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Rob Cox: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the free cash flow. I just want to make sure I understand what exactly is driving the lower free cash flow guide? Because it sounds like the restructuring is it material this year and you mentioned the invoicing was a temporary issue. So just trying to understand what exactly is driving the guide lower.
Christa Davies: Yeah. It's really about the temporary invoicing delay Rob. We had that in Q3. And while we're addressing the system issue, we could continue to see temporary impacts to working capital in the fourth quarter.
Rob Cox: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And just on the restructuring program, just compared to your history with these programs and some peers the 2.6x saving ratio maybe seems a little conservative for a program that includes an element of workforce rationalization. So just curious if as management views it that way and if we could potentially see more savings come to light beyond the $350 million?
Greg Case: Rob, we're glad you asked the question. We appreciate it. Listen I think it's worth stepping back here a little bit and really making sure you understand exactly what we're trying to get accomplished here because this is different than anything you certainly ever had seen from us before and we're very excited about it. We've said before, look our clients and our colleagues they're demanding better solutions. You're seeing it every day the survey, I described identified some of the challenges they see really around risk capital beyond our solution lines and human capital. And to be clear, we're delivering on those solutions through Aon United, but they're demanding we go further faster and they're asking us about this. Our colleagues see it and they're incredibly excited about our ability to deliver on it. And for us, the opportunity is clear. We've got Aon Business Services. We've got the platform in place. We have a long way to go on it, but supported by 15,000 colleagues we know we can accomplish this objective around clients and we can do it faster and accelerate the strategy and build a stronger client-facing terms. So that's basically the focus of what we're trying to do. And to be clear, this is easy to say but hard to do. I mean, data analytics the operating platforms have all got to be connected and integrated teams have got to be aligned to accomplish the goal and that's exactly the path we're on. And now we're going to accelerate it. And as Christa observed for a firm that really obsesses around return on invested capital, we believe this investment is going to be one of the most compelling ever. But I'm thinking Eric to bring it to life it's just so important everyone understands exactly what we're doing. How does this show up from a client standpoint in your view?
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg. And maybe I'll do to an example might be the easiest way to bring it to life because it's evolving so quickly that as clients are looking at these exposures and these developments, they're pressing us for more insight more analytics and maybe just one that's come to mind around climate which is such a topic today. We had a client in Asia Pacific that was looking at severe weather and how it was going to affect their loan portfolio, how it was going to affect their future financial obligations in terms of disclosure. And we engage with them because they had asked us about their future. They asked us about the physical climate risk that was coming. But as we began to talk to them, they were really starting to press for a baseline of their loan exposures today, which required climate analytics that are cutting edge and are really just coming to the fore. And so what they're doing with it today is they're looking at integrating their climate analytics into their risk modeling themselves, as they go forward as a business. And I guess the point of it is, that capability as it's being developed and being brought to the market, really allows all types of clients to look at climate physical risk, put it into their own business model as they go forward, but they're starting from one place and often ending in another. But to be able to deliver those analytics in the form that they can use to be able to build their own business, Aon Business Services provides that engine to be able to aggregate the data to be able to put it in usable format going forward. So we're really excited about what this gives us and the ability to replicate that across the globe as financial institutions of all type are being pressed to understand their climate risk.
Christa Davies: And then just in terms of the financial piece Rob, it is $900 million of cash restructuring charge to deliver $350 million of savings in year in 2026. We don't expect to go above that guidance. We do expect in terms of financial guidance to continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth or greater for the full year 2023 and over the long-term. We expect to deliver adjusted operating margin for the full year 2023, full year 2024 and over the long-term, and we expect these program savings will contribute to ongoing sustainable long-term margin expansion. And then while free cash flow will be impacted in the short-term, we expect to return to our trajectory of double-digit free cash flow over the long-term, driven by operating income growth and ongoing working capital improvements. And then lastly as Greg said, we look at all of these investments across Aon on a disciplined ROIC basis. And I want to reiterate, we focus intensely on cash and we think about all investments on this disciplined basis. This investment is no different. It will name us to accelerate the work we're doing across the firm and ultimately contribute to great long-term shareholder value creation across our key metrics in line with our track record.
Rob Cox: Thanks. Appreciate all the color.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.
Paul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for the call. Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about whether or not the restructuring charge here, the cost savings from the restructuring charge that we're looking at is really additive to the ongoing margin improvement? In other words, would you need to have – do you need to have this effort to continue that margin expansion? I think given how good the margins are people sometimes wonder if there's a limit here and if you more extraordinary things need to happen to continue to have that margin expansion.
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question, Paul. And look, the way we think about financial guidance going forward is mid-single-digital greater organic revenue growth in 2023 in the long-term, margin expansion in 2023, full year 2024 and over the long-term and then double-digit free cash flow growth long-term. We do expect this program to help us accelerate the strategy and we expect the savings to contribute to margin expansion next year. But what we'd also say is we think about margin expansion holistically, Paul. And so each year we've continued to say this. We have a gross margin expansion that's higher than what we met, generate for shareholders and we continue to invest. And you've seen that in calendar year 2023 as well, where we've continued to invest in technology, you can see technology expenses up CapEx, where we're investing in long-term technology platforms to drive long-term productivity. And so we're investing in a long-term strategy as we generate great results for shareholders each and every year.
Greg Case: Maybe I would just add one other point on this Paul. When you think about the margin, we often get asked about this is, it's almost like it's treated like a zero-sum game, the split between clients and colleagues and shareholders. We don't see it that way. We see it around value. The example Eric described is really around incremental value to a client, asking a question they hadn't asked before, we provided an insight around analytics. That simply is not possible without Aon Business Services on a scale basis. We provide incremental value. We get obviously compensated for that. That actually – that contribution is really what drives margin over time. So greater value means more margin. And so that's what you're hearing today sort of how we're going to invest create greater capability to deliver more value for clients and that really is the engine around margin improvement, which is why we're so confident now even more so with this investment to continue margin improvement over time.
Paul Newsome: So it's been pointed out to me this morning that the restructuring charge that you folks are planning on taking relative to the ongoing stages is on the larger end of where historically folks have done you've done a lot of these sort of efforts successfully. Is there anything structurally different with what you're doing here as compared to some of the other efforts -- other charges and savings efforts that you've done in the past?
Christa Davies: It is Paul. Yeah. It is very different. So what we would say and I think Greg said this earlier is, it's responding to client need. And meeting unmet client needs. And we are seeing more of that than ever before. And you saw that in our risk survey where clients have significant unmet client needs, but Aon Business Services at the catalyst here. And we're really building on a proven track record of success and we see Aon Business Services as a catalyst which drives risk capital, human capital and Aon client leadership strategies. And we brought together a set of new leaders and developed a three-year strategy to further strengthen and connect our firm. And this strategy accelerates our ability to deliver on standardized platforms, standardize operations and innovative product scale. And so that is very different than what we've done before Paul. And that really is much more sustainable long-term strategy development, that's going to benefit clients, going to benefit colleagues and going to benefit shareholders.
Greg Case: I mean, as we think about it Paul. We've got tremendous reinforcement around risk capital and human capital and how we're approaching clients in that regard. Everyone can talk about a piece of good work for an individual client. We're talking about taking the Eric example, and really how do you scale that and do that all over the world. And then when you're done with that, keep getting it better and better. You can't do that without Aon Business Services. I mean this is 15,000 colleagues around the world with a team led by Christa, brought together Mindy Simon others who brought talent from really outside of our industry or help us think about how to evolve that. And the strength of that is extraordinary in our ability to actually scale new integrated analytics. This is the structural investment that we now see we can do much faster. In fact clients are requiring us to do it much faster than we would have done overtime. That's what's fundamentally different. This is very different than anything you've ever seen before. And the reason we're so excited about it is, because again clients are demanding our colleagues are excited to deliver it. And this is a structural move that really bets on our history. We've already made progress. This is the strategy we're doubling down and investing on it, in a structural way that will help us scale and really innovate more effectively.
Paul Newsome: Great. Thank you. I always appreciate the help and your patience.
Operator: Our next question is from Charlie Lederer with Citi. Please proceed.
Charlie Lederer: Hey. Good morning. I'll ask another on the acceleration program. It sounds like a revenue synergy play in a lot of ways too. Am I digesting that correctly? And can you talk about how it will differentiate you from your competitors?
Christa Davies: Yeah. So let me describe what I would tell you is this is absolutely using Aon Business Services as a catalyst. And the Aon Business Services strategy is really around standardizing operations creating scale and standardized platforms and then build up on top of those platforms to create products at scale that really drive innovation for clients. And then if you think about it if you bring all of those people as Greg said, 15,000 people in Aon Business Services, 1,000 data scientists driving analytics data and analytics then you could actually apply AI, whether that's machine -- at the machine learning and/or the generative AI end across these platforms and services to drive greater analytical insight and greater value for clients. But Eric, I mean, you see this every day with clients…
Eric Andersen: Yeah, absolutely.
Christa Davies: … what is your though here.
Eric Andersen: Absolutely Chris. Listen the whole strategy is predicated upon bringing our risk capital and human capital colleagues together to be able to do more for clients. We can talk about a lot of examples and all usual on the Parametric business which is actually bringing reinsurance knowledge to commercial clients as well on the health care side where we're using bonds to be able to do resiliency and other things. That just doesn't happen by accident. It needs capability. It needs analytics it needs connectivity and it needs an enterprise client strategy where we can deliver those capabilities right at the largest most complex clients. So really excited about the opportunity Paul.
Charlie Lederer : Got it. Thanks. And I guess do you guys feel like you have the data science talent in your workforce today to have this, or are those hires kind of part of this plan?
Eric Andersen : We have 1,000 data scientists across our risk capital business. And so I feel like we're cutting edge in that area.
Greg Case : The other piece you kind of come back to and this is what -- these individual pieces are around the firm. They're phenomenal. They're tremendous in their own right. What Christmas describing is the wiring the mechanism to connect them more effectively. So it's not just a 1,000. It's 1,000 interconnected against a strategy around analytics and prioritization around analytics against specific client issues. So it's a thoughtful strategy that we can actually execute that day on business services. And the acceleration as we would have done that over time now we're going to double down and do that. This is what's going to change the relevance profile for our clients. These are the questions they're asking. And so it's not just the 1,000 and whatever it ends up becoming over time, it's how that 1,000 is going to work together. And the level of comparable data they're going to have around the world. And the example, Eric is given just -- is not just in single analytics and commercial risk or Reinsurance eventually, we'll cut across talent we'll cut across health and so to have that integrated platform that you can execute the analytics upon with the talent on top of it is huge. And some of the folks that Christa has brought in, many time we brought in, have come from outside the industry literally from companies who are world class at analytics and they see an opportunity to really up the world understand risk and volatility differently and they find it incredibly compelling. And so our view is this is a great opportunity for colleagues in a way that really unlocks a lot of opportunity for them because they're going to be talking to clients about these types of issues.
Charlie Lederer : Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on commercial risk. Growth slowed there in the quarter. I was hoping to get more color on what's driving that. Is that still a slowdown in the M&A and IPO activity, or is there something else going on within that business in the quarter?
Eric Andersen : Hi, Elyse. Hi, Thanks, this is Eric. We continue to see strong activity across EMEA Pacific and core P&C very solid new business retention all the sort of underpinnings that you would look for. We did continue to see a slowdown in M&A and call M&A services which are the things that come off of mergers and acquisitions whether it's DL one-off whether it's reps and warranties things like that continue to slow down pretty significantly in the quarter.
Greg Case : And we've said this last time I think on the call Elyse. We love this area and this team. They are phenomenal. We just got such great capability here and Eric and team have continued to kind of double down and invest behind content capability. We're quite confident that transactions will come back at some point in time when they do we're unbelievably well positioned. And we'll absorb the headwind in the process but very, very bullish on the future in this category.
Elyse Greenspan : So until the activity comes back would, you expect like the organic growth within commercial risk to stay in like a 4% to 5% range, or was there anything unique to the third quarter?
Eric Andersen : There was nothing unique in the third quarter. When we look at some of the strong areas around the world, some of the specialty businesses like construction that continue to have very solid performance, we're pretty happy with the way the business has been performing and when that area comes back. We've held the team and are really excited about the future opportunity.
Elyse Greenspan: And then I want to come back to the savings program. So $350 million by 2026. Are you expecting the entirety of that to fall to the bottom-line and that I know you guys mentioned in your comments as well as in the slides that there is platform location technology there's some workforce changes. Can you bucket can you break down the $350 million by the areas that are specifically driving the savings?
Christa Davies: So thanks so much for the question, Elyse. The first answer is yes we do expect the $350 million to drop to the bottom line. We obviously are continuing to invest in the business as I described earlier. A good example of that is the investments we've made in technology in the first nine months of the year. You see that in our technology expense and our CapEx expense both being up funding investments in long-term operations, technology platforms and product development to meet client needs. And so we will see those savings drop to the bottom line but they are in the context of our overall financial guidance which is mid single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for 2023 and the long term. margin expansion in 2023-2024 in the long term and long-term double-digit free cash flow growth. And then in terms of the breakout we do expect the breakout of the $900 million to be primarily technology expense and workforce optimization. We have not provided specific details on that and we will report on it each quarter.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. So first just on organic growth. Are you able to quantify how much of the slower M&A and transaction-related activity has been to your growth maybe either in an absolute sense versus normal or maybe versus a year ago just so we get a sense of how your results will be versus peers that have less of that.
Eric Andersen: Sure. This is Eric. We don't disclose that number, but I would just say if you track M&A from outside sources is certainly down 30% year-on-year and that continues to show headwinds. And I would just say, listen as that recovers we will recover with it. We've maintain the team. We've maintained the relationships. We continue to stay very close to those clients. And when they react we will be right there with them. But it's a good business for us. We really think it provides great value to them and the ultimate clients and we continue to hold and invest in that team.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on free cash flow should we assume that it will get to double-digit growth in 2026 once the program is done, or is it after that earlier than that?
Christa Davies: So we haven't given specific guidance on the timing. What we have said is that we absolutely expect long-term free cash flow growth. We run the firm on free cash flow. We are extremely bullish on long-term free cash flow growth driven by operating income growth and working capital improvements. And so this will absolutely contribute to that. And so we're very, very excited about the outlook for free cash flow growth long-term.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just lastly we've gotten a lot of questions on the sort of impact on your business from the West fallout. And do you expect any financial impact or reputational or otherwise, or have you seen anything that you're able to discuss beyond what's in your regulatory filing?
Eric Andersen: Listen, I would say from a best view -- go ahead Christa, I'm sorry.
Christa Davies: No you go Eric.
Eric Andersen: I would just say best view is one of the many parties that have been involved in the business whether it's reinsurance, whether it's other areas. And we continue to monitor the situation very carefully working with our clients helping them to provide options to replace that lost capital. And we continue to see that work being done and our expectation is, it will continue to evolve as their bankruptcy process works its way through.
Jimmy Bhullar: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
David Motemaden: Hi, thanks, good morning. I just had a question on the accelerated Aon United program more so on the revenue side and how we can think about that. It sounds like a big opportunity. I guess I'm a little surprised that you aren't making any changes to your organic growth outlook in the mid-single digit or greater. So maybe could you just talk about how much you would expect this program to contribute to accelerated organic growth. It would be helpful just to maybe put some numbers around it. I'm sure you guys look at it internally. So yes, I'm just trying to get a sense for how we can think about the revenue opportunity here.
Greg Case: David, I would come back and just think about literally. This is about client relevance as Eric described I think very well. What this is going to do is help us, innovate and be more relevant to clients on the issues that matter most to them that will have impact over time. What we want to be clear though is in terms of sort of the progress. We're staying mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, continuing margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth. For us, that will be the validation and this accelerates that strategy and certainly increase its probability and success against that in every way shape or form. And if there's opportunity beyond that fantastic, but you start with that. We love that story. And we're incredibly excited about what this does with that story which is just really delivers on it.
David Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And then maybe, this is an acceleration of Aon United. But you -- I believe it was a number maybe five, six years ago that you guys had initially instituted the strategy -- the Aon United strategy. So I'm wondering, if you just -- if I'm not thinking about this new program, but looking at Aon United in the past once you instituted that program. Is there any way to size historically how much of that program contributed to the organic growth that we saw, I guess maybe leading up to the COVID pandemic?
Greg Case: Well, this is very important, because we obviously track and look at this all the time. This is why as we described in the opening, we came to a level of conviction that said we're not going to evolve this. We're doing it now. We're moving now. We're going to make the investments now to accelerate faster than we would have before because the track that we've laid this continues to get more relevant to clients. If you think about it 10 years ago, we talked about increasing risk. It turns out 10 years later, my God you might have been right on that. There's risk everywhere around the world interconnected climate is real, all the everything is real, cyber everything. And so our clients are asking for more and the fundamental aspect that everybody can talk about delivering it but unless you're a connected firm, truly supporting each other around the globe you cannot deliver on it and you certainly can't innovate at a level that equates to what client demand is. And so that's what Aon United has given us. What you've seen us do over the last bit of time is really structurally double down on that. Risk capital and human capital only five, six, seven months ago, structurally really connected how we bring analytics across the entire risk spectrum, not just in commercial risk reinsurance but also the risk spectrum on talent, on health, et cetera. All these things come together and that's the next step sort of in the process. So for us, it isn't about -- it equated to a $1 value here or there or revenue or margin here or there. It's fundamental D&A. This connectivity around Aon United allowed us to do risk capital and human capital. It allowed us to do on business services. That's an impossibility without Aon United. And what we've got now with Eric and the team leading risk capital and human capital is a chance to accelerate it into the market with innovation. Under Christa's leadership with Aon Business Services a chance to really enable it structurally in ways we've never done before. So this for us is a natural step that we would have evolved in the process. And all you're hearing about today is that excitement level is higher than ever before, not because of us but because the clients and our colleagues saying we need this we want to deliver it. And what you see us doing today is saying, okay, we're going to accelerate and drive it. And that's really what the investment is about.
David Motemaden: Understood. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Our next question is from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. Good morning. This is Charlie on for Yaron. You guys in the past have pointed to a multiyear track record of roughly 90 bps of annual margin expansion. And I guess should we expect the new cost savings program to be incremental on top of that, or should we continue to expect roughly 90 bps year-over-year?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question Charlie. So you're right. For the last 12 years, we've delivered 1,120 basis points of margin expansion so approximately 90 basis points a year. And what we've said with this program is the $350 million of savings in the year and 2026 will fall to the bottom line. They are incorporated into and a part of our long-term sustainable margin expansion where we will deliver margin expansion in 2023, full year 2024 and over the long-term. And as I mentioned earlier, what we're really doing Charlie is, we are investing in the business in client-facing innovation and content and capability and data analytics to help solve client needs and provide more innovative solutions to clients to help provide better colleague technology and to drive long-term productivity. And that's really the heart of the Aon Business Services strategy, which is really the catalyst for us investing here today.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks. And then I guess just you guys have talked about expecting cost savings to ramp towards the $350 million by 2026. How should we think about the cadence of the $900 million over that same period?
Christa Davies: We have not given specific guidance on the $900 million, Charlie. So what we will do is report charges and savings each quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our last question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks. First, a conceptual question I guess maybe for Eric. You talked about being committed to the M&A space, which suggests that there are disproportionate amounts of expenses relative to current revenues. Can you give us a way of thinking about maybe the margin impact that this revenue pressure is providing?
Eric Andersen: Listen, I wouldn't think about it that way. I would think about what can we do with the talent while there's a downturn. And so the skills that those -- that that team has in terms of client coverage and product expertise, we can redeploy that across the firm and put them to work today while we're waiting out the market certainly, still working those clients and trying to innovate with new products and opportunities but at the same time they bring skill sets around client coverage, industry knowledge, product knowledge that we can use across the firm. So they're not just sitting there, if that was what you're thinking, but we're deploying them into the client base.
Meyer Shields: Yes. Okay. I was specially thinking. That is helpful. Second question that I've gotten is, sort of an interesting one. When you talk about double-digit free cash flow growth once the charges of this are done is 2022 still a good base for the compound annual growth rate, or is that double digit from the now lower cash flow if we expect -- free cash flow we expect through 2023? 
Christa Davies: Thanks very much for the question, Meyer. Look, it is of the 2023 baseline. That's the right answer. And I would note, that we're really excited about free cash flow growth in 2023. It's high single digits. And so we'll report 2023 free cash flow and you should grow double-digit long term from there. But what I would say Meyer is, as you think about the free cash flow growth long term it's exceptional. We've delivered 13% CAGR in free cash flow over the last 12 years. And we'll continue to drive mid-single-digit organic -- mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth long term margin expansion in 2023 2024 and long term, and double-digit free cash flow growth long term and we're really excited about our free cash flow growth long term. 
Meyer Shields: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks. 
Greg Case: Just wanted to say thank you, for everyone joining us. We look forward to our conversation next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-28 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding, welcome to Aon Plc's Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2023 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc.
Greg Case: Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We're pleased to report that our global team delivered another strong quarter, performance, results and momentum. And we begin the call today by thanking our colleagues for everything they do to help our clients address immediate and long-term demands around the risk and people. United delivered by our colleagues, gives us the ability to meet this demand and balance across our portfolio. capitalizing on innovation and momentum and investing to meet demand. This ensures we win more, retain more and do more with our clients. There is now almost universal agreement to client demand to address risk and human capital has never been greater. For example, our catastrophe insight report estimated global economic losses for natural disasters in the first half of 2023 and were $194 billion, notably above the 21st century average of $128 billion and fifth highest on record. Even more profound, in addition to economic costs, we know these disasters have tragic human costs that reinforces the high value and building resiliency and protection in advance of disaster. To this end, we recently announced the placement of the Parametric insurance program for the government of Puerto Rico. It's the single largest program of its kind that the U.S. Commonwealth has ever placed. This program was designed by our reinsurance and commercial risk teams. And in the event of a sizable earthquake or hurricane, Puerto Rico will quickly receive liquidity and enabling its government to focus on rapid recovery and reconstruction. This placement was the result of Aon's data, analytics and capabilities from across our firm, cemented by our deep understanding of public entity demand, risk capital and reinsurance markets and really, really great work by our team. Turning to financial performance. In the second quarter, we delivered strong organic revenue growth across our solution line, including 10% growth in health solutions and 9% growth in reinsurance solutions contributing to 6% overall organic growth in the quarter and 7% in the first half. In health solutions and a revenue growth of 10% on top of 11% last year was driven by strength in the core. Our team has done terrific work, helping clients navigate the demands of their talent agendas balancing optimal benefits for their people with inflationary cost pressures while also taking steps to deliver on their people strategy at a time when bringing total rewards, health and wealth benefits together is human capital are more important than ever. In reinsurance solutions, our team delivered another very strong quarter at 9% organic growth on top of 9% last year. Driven by strong net new business generation, our teams continue to help clients navigate a challenging and complex market and are already preparing data, analytics and insight as we help our clients understand and address ongoing volatility and capital considerations. We're also seeing capital come into the market, particularly in cat bonds as our team has placed over $5 billion across 21 deals year-to-date. In wealth solutions, we delivered 2% organic growth driven by ongoing trends in demand we've seen in project work around market volatility and regulatory changes, as well as the ongoing trend of pension derisking, which we expect to continue in the quarters coming ahead, given the market conditions. We continue to see opportunity to help clients react and prepare for regulatory changes, and market volatility with our data analytics and expertise. And finally, commercial risk solutions delivered 5% organic growth in the quarter. Globally, we saw strong growth across most major geographies with double-digit growth in Asia and the Pacific. In the U.S., we saw strength in core retail brokerage, including from property, casualty, and construction. As we've communicated previously, results were pressured by the impact of external M&A and IPO markets on M&A services, a headwind we now expect to continue in the back half of the year, given ongoing external conditions. Overall, in the quarter, our strong performance was driven by the strength of our Aon United strategy and Al Business Services platform. In Q2, we translated 6% organic revenue growth into 110 basis points of operating margin expansion. Net of ongoing investment in the business for long-term growth. These results contributed to first half financial performance of 7% organic revenue growth and 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. And we remain very well positioned to maintain this momentum and to deliver on our ongoing financial guidance of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth for 2023 and the long term. This financial performance is ultimately the product of our ability to address client needs to Aon United. And this strength is foundational in supporting our ability to evolve in response to changing client demand, fully demonstrated by our move to risk capital and human capital. This focus is bringing our 4 solution lines more closely together to better address client needs and is already yielding meaningful client impact. Take human capital. Our clients are changing how they're thinking about their colleagues. We're facing an increasingly complex external environment with pressures around cost, growth, remote and hybrid work and workforce composition. On their own internal environment, their people strategies are increasingly complex, considering traditional total rewards and health benefits and newer additions around future skills and well-being. Our connectivity and across health, wealth and talent, enables us to bring data, analytics and solutions to address this need. In one great example, our team developed a diagnostic tool for clients that produces a human sustainability index, or HSI this tool combines individual and team assessments with peer data and analytics-based benchmarking to enable our clients to directly connect people strategy goals to execution. The measurable results encompassing 8 wellness pathways such as physical, emotional and financial aspects, supports individuals and teams to assess exactly what's working and for whom, along key metrics, so our clients can adjust or change their tactics to drive their people strategy and ultimately, their bottom line. In many respects, this work represents bringing next level data science into talent development and leadership. Ultimately, the HSI solution identifies gaps and what our clients offer to their people, encompassing health, wealth, rewards, and other wellness programs, and it provides a trackable plan to strengthen the company's talent strategy on their most significant often external commitments at a time when these commitments are more important than ever. In summary, our strong performance is a direct result of our ability to help clients better understand their challenges and opportunities and to take actions to protect their business and improve their performance. Further, our recently announced enhanced focus on risk capital and human capital is already driving benefits and strengthening this capability. Our strong year-to-date financial results, including 7% organic revenue growth and 90 basis points of margin expansion, on the direct outcome of the strategy and position us very well to continue delivering in 2023 and over the long term. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we continued delivering on our key financial metrics, both in the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first half, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. These results position us very well to continue to drive results in 2023 and over the long term, and we look forward to building on this momentum. As I reflect on our performance through the first half of the year, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 6% in Q2 and 7% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term. I would also note that reported revenue growth of 7% in Q2 and 6% year-to-date -- sorry, 6% in Q2, 7% in Q2 and 6% year-to-date, includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX of 1% for Q2 and 2% year-to-date, primarily driven by a strong dollar versus most currencies. I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, with $64 million in Q2 and $116 million year-to-date or 2% of total revenue in both periods. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement with adjusted operating margins of 33.6% in the first half, an increase of 90 basis points driven by revenue growth and efficiencies from May on business services, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth. Looking forward, we expect to deliver sustainable margin expansion in 2023 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. As we've said previously, Aon Business Services remains one of our key drivers of margin improvement, and this operating model has now reached an inflection point. In response to client demand and the opportunity, we're evolving to an organization that drives efficiency, operating leverage and margin expansion to one that's also increasingly driving improved client service delivery and accelerating innovation at scale. This evolution of Aon Business Services requires investment in three areas, which we expect to manage in line with our ongoing financial guidance and like we do for all investments in long-term growth, on a disciplined ROIC basis. First, standardized platforms. We're digitizing and connecting existing platforms and creating an ecosystem that encompasses technology and operations that brings our data, analytics and expertise together for our clients and our colleagues. Second, standardized operations. Across our solution lines, there are places where we have common processes. We see opportunity to continue to bring operations and expertise together across our firm, to support clients across all solution lines, bringing people and process together, drive further efficiency enables us to scale best practices. Third, new products at scale. We see significant opportunity to deliver new data-driven products, which we can then effectively develop and scale. The work we've done to standardize platforms and operations enable us to rapidly develop, deliver and scale innovative solutions across the portfolio. In response to client demand and to deliver content and capability to all clients both from organic or inorganic investments. Even more importantly, operating Aon Business Services as one organization with disciplined prioritization and governance around initiatives ensures we can move quickly on opportunities that create value for our clients and colleagues, such as the one we see on AI.  Just as a few examples. We see real opportunity here to enhance colleague productivity by leveraging the services of our technology partners in a protected environment to enhance existing offerings like our human capital assistance by building an AI risk framework for our clients. And finally, to create complementary data sets to enhance our risk analytics like the catastrophe modeling. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 5% in Q2 and 6% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.05 in the quarter and $0.19 per share year-to-date. If currency is to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no impact in the third quarter and a favorable impact of $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter for an unfavorable impact of $0.14 per share for full year 2023. I'd also note, other nonoperating expense had a $0.25 per share or 10% unfavorable impact in Q2, and a $0.44 per share or 6% unfavorable impact year-to-date. This reflects an unfavorable impact from increase in noncash net periodic pension expense, as well as a gain on sale of businesses in the prior year period and balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period. Turning to free cash flow and capital allocation. Cash from operations was flat year-over-year and free cash flow decreased 7% to $986 million, primarily driven by a $77 million increase in CapEx. As we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and free cash flow generation in the second half of the year is seasonally stronger than the first half. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year. CapEx was elevated in the first half of the year compared to the prior year period as we initiated a number of projects with spend heavily weighted in the first half across technology to drive long-term growth like the investments we're making to evolve Aon Business Services. I'd note CapEx can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We expect CapEx to moderate in the back half of the year and now expect an investment of $220 million to $250 million in CapEx in 2023. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments on a disciplined ROIC basis. Our outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond remains strong, and we continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvement. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today highlighted by approximately $1.1 billion of share repurchase year-to-date. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capability that we can scale to address unmet client need. Our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our highest priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. As we've said before, we expect to add incremental debt as EBITDA growth over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade credit profile. I'd note our term debt is all fixed rate with an average weighted interest rate of approximately 4% and an average weighted maturity of approximately 11 years. In summary, our strong financial results for the quarter and year-to-date reflects strong operational performance driven by our Aon United strategy and our Aon Business Services platform. We expect to continue to make progress on our key financial metrics and our commitment to drive long-term shareholder value creation. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Charlie Lederer with Citi.
Charlie Lederer: You mentioned continued headwinds in M&A services in the back half of this year in your prepared remarks. When should we think about that dynamic lapping? And is it more of a pricing issue? Or can you comment on what's driving that?
Greg Case: I really appreciate the question, Charlie. Just start overall, just commercial fundamentals generally. Obviously, that's part of the real question. very strong retention, very strong new business exceptional, a lot of strength around geographies around and core P&C. It really is this 1 area in M&A services, which is a particular strength of ours. But as you know, deals -- yield count and volume was down 30% to 40%. We expect that in the first half of the year, we expect to see it in the second half of the year. As that comes back, we will come back with an absolute vent just given our overall position. But Eric, anything else you'd add to that?
Eric Andersen: Yes, Greg, I would just say that while the deal volume is down, as you're saying, we have been spending time with the team expanding the potential client base. The historic nature of the product has been driven more towards private equity-type buyers. But we've been spending time working with the corporate clients, making sure they're aware of the capabilities and how those products and services get used. So that when the market does come back, and it will come back, we'll be situated to lead that market as we do today.
Christa Davies: And Charlie, I would just say that while we've lapped the downturn, we do expect the pressure to continue in the second half as the external outlook has continued to be soft.
Charlie Lederer: And then I'm wondering if you can comment on the momentum in your IP business, intellectual properties. How meaningful is that to organic revenue growth? And there have been some articles in the press about it recently. So just trying to understand how you see that business affecting second half results, if at all?
Greg Case: Love this question, Charlie. Really appreciate you raising it. We love this business. It is a phenomenal opportunity for us. If you think about intellectual property overall, this is just hugely significant. This is representative -- we talked before, 85% of the value of the S&P 500, which really tied back to intangible assets. And if you go back to 2016, we started with an amazing investment, bringing in 601West to Aon, it's 20, 25 colleagues. We've now invested in hundreds of colleagues with a truly unique market-leading platform to really help understand this opportunity and these risks and the value of these assets. And we built a marketplace with so many insurers 26, almost 30 insurers sort of in the marketplace $2 billion in aggregate insured transaction value. And by the way, demand is stronger than ever. And we're evolving in the market, and there are always so many different third parties out in the marketplace and different things that affect that. But we love the position. We love the progress we've made, and we feel stronger than ever about the future opportunity. Eric, anything else you'd add?
Eric Andersen: Yes, maybe two things, Greg. One, as a percent of revenue, it's still -- the market is still in its infancy. So I wouldn't overly rotate on it other than the potential that we see down the road. And to your other question, about some of the activity in the market. Obviously, we're not going to comment on specific third parties. But I would say, as part of our fundamental role of matching risk to capital, we work with many of parties that bring capital to the marketplace. Some of them use let us a credit to backstop the capital, used by the third parties. But it does provide the kind of capital and that we need that the clients need to deploy to gain reinsurance capital that they're looking for. So it's just one of the ways that we match risk of capital together on behalf of our clients.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Zaremski: I guess back to the organic growth environment. Just curious, you mentioned some headwinds on the M&A side. There's probably some tailwinds, too, which we can see. But would you say you were clear to about 5% or greater is still the outlook. But would you say growth is kind of thinking back to the back half of the year is kind of steady or accelerating or decelerating? Or any trends you'd like to point out in any of your businesses in terms of momentum or tailwinds other than the M&A call out that we should be considering into the back half of the year?
Greg Case: Yes. Literally, Mike, I love this question. If you step back and think about sort of the growth platform and how it's evolved. First, just for context, we put -- we think about growth and really all the benchmark objectives over the course of the year. So if you think about it, for us, growth is organic revenue and growth is, by the way, margin improvement, and growth is absolutely the translation into free cash flow. And we would say, if you think about just performance in Q2 and really the first half, it's really reinforced our confidence and you see momentum around meaning our full year 2023 objective. So this is mid-single digit or greater across the board, look at the strengths in health, which were exceptional for the first half, and certainly for the quarter in reinsurance and other areas, too, even in commercial risk with the headwind that we just highlighted. So very strong on the solution line side. And then you also saw exceptional movement on margin expansion. When you think about the growth here to 110 basis points for the Q and 90 basis points for the first half. And most importantly, you heard Christa reemphasize double-digit free cash flow growth for the year. So for us, we see this trend continuing to turn where we are. And there's a lot that goes behind that. Maybe, Eric, additional context around that foundation or what's driving that?
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg. And you mentioned 2 of them in your written remarks around the Parametric that we did for Puerto Rico as well as the Human Sustainability Index. Those are just 2 examples of the Aon United teams working together. But I think I would also say that the client demand is evolving, and it's getting more complicated, I think as the world gets more complicated. And so our strategy of evolving to risk capital and human capital, I think, uniquely positions us to take advantage of that capital to drive growth -- I'm sorry, take advance of that situation to drive growth. And when I think about it, just to put a little clarity on it, from a risk capital standpoint, I think it gives us a couple of things. It gives us access to global capital no matter what form. So insurance, reinsurance, ILS parametrics to help clients transfer the risk that they want to transfer, and also create more dynamic markets. And I think it also helps us to create and deliver the analytics that have historically driven our reinsurance business over to the large corporate clients who have a more acute need today, to understand their risk from property exposure, to climate change, as well as the cyber liability exposures. And it also gives our leaders client leaders and brokers, the best insight of the market dynamics. So that's on the risk capital side. On the human capital side, bringing health, wealth and talent together is effectively meeting clients where they are today. Clients are looking for a holistic view for their employee relationships, both from hiring, training, health wellness all the way through to retirement. And we're seeing that. We're really excited to see that strong growth in our core health and benefit business globally. Winning new clients, expanding the relationship with them across all aspects of that employee life cycle is gratifying and exciting. So we see a lot of opportunity with both risk capital and human capital, both in our strong core but also as we develop sort of new capabilities. But Christa, anything you could add to that?
Christa Davies: Well, I mean, Mike, you also did just ask about second half outlook. And we would say year-to-date growth was 7%. We do think about our results over the course of the full year. And we are on track for our full year guidance, mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth. And so we're really excited about the momentum in the first half and that continuing into the second half. And I think just each quarter, we have different seasonality of revenue, but we really do think about it over the course of a full year. And so mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year.
Mike Zaremski: And my quick follow-up is curious on the expense efficiency side, a number of competitors have kind of talked about leaning in to be able to kind of find more ways to be efficient over the last, I guess, in this post-pandemic world and there's different nuances to each company's strategy, but it feels like some of them are taking off of the and United Playbook, which you guys were a first mover on. Just curious, is there anything you want to call out in terms of -- do you see incrementally more opportunities today for expense efficiencies or nothing really to call out that's getting you guys even more excited about kind of some margin levers in the coming year.
Christa Davies: Look, we do actually, Mike. So thank you for the question. Look, we are on the next evolution of Aon Business Services. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, expanding from just driving efficiency to really improve customer service delivery, and innovation at scale, helping us accelerate growth. And so as we think about margins, we think about margins again over the course of the full year, sustainably and over the long term. And year-to-date, we saw 90 basis points of margin expansion, and offset by investments in the business including people and in our technology. In particular, you saw an increased investment in IT, 13% year-to-date. And the majority of this is around our core business platforms to help clients and support revenue growth. And you saw CapEx up as well, again, driving long-term margin expansion through the continued investments around standardized operations, standardized platforms, and innovation at scale, which we are really excited about in Aon Business services.
Eric Andersen: Yes, one comment on it because we -- I know the question was on efficiency, but the ability to leverage the analytics that we have inside of ABS helped us develop the human Sustainability Index, helped us create the insight that we're able to bring to corporate clients. As they think about managing their climate exposure from a property standpoint, how all of that comes together is part of the ABS strategy and how we execute it. So while there is efficiency, there is great opportunity, I think, to drive new products, new solutions and better solutions that our larger clients are looking for us to help them.
Greg Case: And just to remind you, Mike, we brought in -- we've been working on this since 2017, actually prior to that by 2017. We have literally with the leadership under Christa, our new COO and others brought an India tremendous amount of capability to bear. And now we're on kind of the next wave, building on a very, very strong platform that we pulled together. So it's -- for us, we're very excited about this. for both the efficiency reasons that Christa described very well and the effectiveness outcomes that Eric described. And that really is the muscle and the foundation of Aon Business Services. Very excited about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Weston Bloomer: My first question is on comp and benefits. It looks like that picked up pretty meaningfully over the last 5 quarter trend and you highlighted investments in colleagues and there's a pretty high competition for talent. Can you maybe comment on the pace of hiring you're seeing more broadly? And was there maybe a pickup in retention based comp in the quarter? Would be curious on maybe attrition rates and commercial risk and reinsurance as well.
Christa Davies: And so maybe I'll start with sort of the math of just -- if you think about this, and again, we look at the sort of over a full year. But if you just did year-to-date, you'd see organic revenue growth of 7% year-to-date. Comp and ben is up 4% year-to-date. And so there's lumpiness in every quarter. And so what we would say is we feel good about that. And in terms of attrition, we would note that attrition in 2023 is below 2019 or below pre-pandemic levels. And so we feel really good about where attrition is across the board. And we also would note that engagement levels are at the highest they've ever been in the firm's history. And so we feel really good about the talent we're attracting. But Eric, you may want to jump in here just in terms of the talent side.
Eric Andersen: Yes, sure, Christa. And I always think that the industry spends a lot of time reading the headlines on some of the industry rags about people move here and there. And I think it gets over rotated as Christa, you shared some of the great steps. I will say we are making some pretty significant talent investments in our core health and benefit business, in our strategy and technology group inside of reinsurance. Some of our key geographies where we're seeing great growth opportunities. So a lot of great things happening there, Christa, and you shared the metrics of engagement and attrition and things like that. But I would -- one last comment I would make on it, is on our risk capital and human capital platforms it actually allows us to increase the flexibility of where we deploy talent to opportunities. So being able to take reinsurance analytics and help a commercial client think about analytics like an insurance company does, I think, gives us a real competitive advantage. But other than that, we continue to invest pretty heavily in our talent, and we would expect to do so to come in the future.
Weston Bloomer: And then my second question is on wealth solutions organic. I know you had highlighted difficult comp on performance fees in the quarter. I was wondering if you could maybe quantify that impact? And then is wealth solutions a business where you could see mid-single-digit organic growth over the next year, maybe more in line with the rest of Aon. That growth had been lower single digits over the past few years. So curious if we're seeing maybe momentum there.
Eric Andersen: Maybe I'll take that one, Greg. Look, I think the wealth solutions business is a great business for us, and we do see growth opportunities over the mid and long term. If you think about the pieces of it, the retirement piece, which is the pension actuarial work, continues to be a solid business for us. There's a whether it's in the pension derisking that Christa mentioned or whether it's just regulatory changes that drive activity. The U.K., EMEA, very solid this quarter. And then there's the investment management business. The advisory business continued to be pretty strong. The delegated part of it continues to have some impact from the AUM movement from -- in U.K. and North America that we talked about last time. But overall, really bullish on the business and expect that it will hit mid-single digits for us as we go down the road.
Operator: Our next questions are from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Bob Huang: I know that you talked quite a bit about tech innovation and efficiency. Maybe if I can just dig a little bit deeper on the cost of AI implementation, right? Obviously, tremendous potential down the road, but from what we've seen recently, for example, Microsoft just announced that their AI-enabled products are twice as expensive as non AI-enabled products. Just going down that line of thinking, can you maybe help us think about how your AI investments fits in -- the cost of that fits into your three areas of investing with the AR business right now?
Christa Davies: Yes. Look, thank you so much for the question, Bob. And we are super excited about AI more broadly and how it can apply to our business. And we would say we think about this in terms of everything from really basic machine learning, robotic process automation, all that stuff that helps us drive automation and efficiency at the sort of very low end, very cheap and super scalable, and we're really looking to implement that broadly across our business, to help our colleagues get out of the sort of day-to-day cutting and pasting and inefficient processes that they're doing today and equally to make things much easier for clients to interact with us and do business. And so that's sort of the low end. And then you could say at the high end, sort of generative AI, it's really helping us drive insight and impact in the analytical areas that Eric was describing around risk capital and human capital. Catastrophe modeling, helping us add data sets, the human capital assistant, helping clients interact with human capital assistants, much like they would an expert in human capital today. And so Bob, we're very thoughtful about the cost of this, and where it's best to use basic technology, machine learning, robotic process automation, because it's just cheaper and more efficient and more scalable broadly. And where we're really trying to have insight and impact with clients and use generative AI. So we're sort of scaling it depending on the impact and opportunity.
Greg Case: And I just had two observations, on this. First, we've been doing AI, as Christa described, really for a decade. So it's not as we haven't been incorporating this. It's one of the reasons we drove an business services. That's my second observation. Because we have Aon Business Services, because we've been working on it since 2017, we actually have a platform to scale these ideas. Absent Aon Business Services, literally, the ability to kind of get this moved around 120 countries around the world is basically 0. So you can come up with a good idea in a geography, but how do you actually systematically move it around the world. So one of the reasons we're excited about our ability to do this and do it cost effectively is Aon Business Services.
Bob Huang: My second question, maybe just to go back to the line of questioning regarding Commercial Risk Solutions, right? And obviously, you've talked in depth about why the U.S. segment is the way it is. But you also -- one of the things we noticed is that Asia has been strong for a few quarters. In the last quarter, you also saw strength in Latin America and rest of the world. Just as we gradually come back to a more normal M&A market in the U.S., how durable is the growth in the rest of the world. I'm just trying to think down to next year, how we should think about Commercial Risk Solutions growth going forward?
Greg Case: Listen, we -- as we've described, we feel very good about the progress back to kind of the overall Aon United strategy, the core fundamentals as you highlighted well geographically very strong. Even in North America, retention very good, new business is very good. Core P&C exceptional. We just have a wonderful strong business, our capability in an area of M&A services, which, by the way, we're feeling now, but we embrace completely because as the market comes back, as Eric described, we benefit from that as well. But the fundamentals, the track is everything we've described around literally winning more clients and been doing more with them, and keeping them longer for all the reasons that we talked about around our overall and strategy. So we're feeling very, very good about trajectory and momentum, recognizing there are market conditions out there, but good about that overall. Eric, what else would you add to that perspective?
Eric Andersen: Yes. Maybe the only other angle I would say, Greg, is the sophistication of the products that are entering into places like Asia-Pacific and Latin America continue to evolve as the clients evolve. So whether it's risk financing techniques, whether a specialty products, whether it's the international as those organizations expand outside their home countries. So as those economies continue to develop, whether it's India, whether it's other parts of Asia, we're able to grow with them and help them as they need more sophisticated products. So we are very excited about the platforms that we have in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, and we do see good growth opportunities over the long term.
Greg Case: One other point on that, Bob, just to sort of make it. I was in Singapore with Christa a month ago, opening our global climate hub, phenomenal. And we had the opportunity to go around and see so many different clients in that perspective. It really reflected exactly what Eric is describing. Their needs becoming more global and more interconnected. They want to see global Aon put it in their backyard. That was a very, very positive sort of overall kind of finding as such as we're standing and thinking about that. It really does bode well to what the opportunities are. And then if you take that in some of Eric's other comments around risk capital and what it really means, bringing reinsurance analytics into the commercial space in an effective way, also something that was very, very positive. So just a specific example in a region, as you highlighted, where we have a particular opportunity. The same is true in Latin America.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Rob Cox: So in reinsurance solutions, really strong results obviously, but I would have thought you would see more acceleration or a sequential acceleration given the Aon Benfield exposure to property cat in the U.S. Can you provide some color there? And then -- also on the prospects for growth in the back half of the year in reinsurance, as we've seen some news articles regarding kind of an above-average chunk of the facultative business being hired by a competitor.
Eric Andersen: Sure. Greg, let me take that one. So on the first half, listen, we are really proud, excited whatever word we can use on our reinsurance capabilities, really great first half, great second quarter, a great first half coming off of a couple of great years. Just remember that most of the treaty business happens in the first half, and so a lot of that is now finished. But I would say that as clients have been dealing with the changing reinsurance market, they've made their own decisions. Sometimes they don't buy certain layers, sometimes they buy less, sometimes they buy differently. And so that's always a decision that we help our clients make as they think through how they want to use reinsurance capital for their business. It does, by the way, explain a little bit of what's going on in the primary market around property, as more of the risk is now sitting on the primary insurers they are now dealing with how do they price it and what kind of risk do they take. So it is an interconnected system of reinsurance and insurance. So just to point that out. And I think on the second half, tends to be more around the ILS business and facultative business. And I do think we had a very strong first half, in fact. And our expectation is that should continue as the primary clients now may have less low-level reinsurance protection on property catastrophe or secondary perils like wildfires or hailstorms or what have you. And so the ability for the insurers to manage that exposure, the tool that they would use now is facultative reinsurance on an individual risk basis. And the last point I'll make, and Greg, maybe I'll throw it to you is facultative reinsurance is also being used on things like captives or large corporates where they're also repaying more of the risk themselves. So don't just think about it as a reinsurance tool. You should also start to think about it as large corporates that are trying to access, not just traditional insurance markets, but also reinsurance markets. But in fact, is the way they do that. But Greg, maybe anything you'd add on that?
Greg Case: You summarized it very well. I would just add a couple of things on the talent point overall and in reinsurance. Look, reinsurance, our colleagues, this has been strength to strength, really over the last 5 years. It's been a tortious. It's also one of the areas we've invested heavily and continued content and capability, not just core reinsurance, but if you think about what we're doing in cat bonds and ILS, we lead the world in this, the work we've done in strategy and technology group Eric described before, this is just substantial investment. And with this core in reinsurance, we now have this incorporated into the overall risk capital effort. And so it's really, for us, we're very -- we're excited about the possibilities and the capability we have to help clients, and it continues to build, which is why we feel so strongly positive about the second half of the year and the ongoing results here.
Rob Cox: And maybe moving back to commercial risk. If we exclude these external factors on the M&A services business, is it fair to assume that the remainder of the business accelerated sequentially, kind of along with the accelerated renewal premium change that we saw in the market this quarter?
Christa Davies: I mean, Rob, we're not giving specific guidance on commercial risk at that level? What we would say is we're extremely excited about year-to-date growth of 7% overall for AON. And on track to mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year. And obviously, we've had a real headwind in this M&A area given transaction volume, as Greg described, is down 30% to 40%, and we expect that softness to continue into the second half of the year.
Rob Cox: And maybe just one last question on health solutions. Really strong growth. Just you guys pointed to the growth outside of the United States being particularly strong. And I'm just curious what's driving that? Is that market share gains, medical inflation? Any color you could provide there?
Eric Andersen: So I would say more of market share gains and the ability of the team to work together globally through global benefits. Remember the health systems are different everywhere in the world. So -- when you look at the U.S. system versus the U.K. versus Europe or anywhere in Asia-Pacific or LatAm, they're very different. But the needs are often of one organization expanding globally. They need that expertise. And so our global team really well connected, working together to able to help global clients as well as local clients. So we think it's market share gains in the local countries and really excited about what they've been doing over the course of the last year or two.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question, Christa, I think last quarter, you had pointed to CapEx of around $200 million to $225 million for the year. I just want to confirm that, that's still your kind of best estimate there. And so with the improvement in free cash flow in the back half, I guess it's going to come from a combination of lower CapEx and just growth in operating cash flow.
Christa Davies: Elyse, we actually have increased our CapEx guidance to be $220 million to $250 million for 2023 and that's really driven by the investments we're making across Aon Business Services platforms and applications. to drive future growth. And so we're really excited about that. The improvement in free cash flow and the double-digit free cash flow growth for the year is going to be driven by operating income growth and working capital. And I did note that second half free cash flow growth is always significantly stronger than first half.
Elyse Greenspan: And then my second question, going back to commercial risk, I recognize right that you guys do have a good market share within the M&A business, right, that has slowed. But you will have easier comps in the back half of the year. even recognizing that there'll be some headwinds from just still low M&A volume. Wouldn't you expect sequentially commercial risk to show better growth in the back half relative to the first half of the year?
Christa Davies: Elyse, I'll try and do this again because I probably didn't explain this well the first time. What we -- we are lapping the comps that's absolutely right. But what we're seeing in the external market is continued pressure into the second half of the year in the M&A environment. So we expect that trend to continue.
Elyse Greenspan: And then in reinsurance solutions, Greg, I think you highlighted just kind of robust cap on activity you guys have seen. How do you -- what are you seeing on the capital side within the reinsurance market and thoughts just for the potential opportunities over the rest of the year and then also into 2024.
Greg Case: Listen, overall, Elyse, and Eric to comment on this, for sure. Look, there's still pressure here. There continues to be pressure on the capital side, we're incredibly vigilant about finding options, matching capital risk in terms of what we do for our clients every day. We're navigating through it. You're seeing movement on the ILS side. We talked about $5 billion we've done in 21 deals year-to-date, which has been phenomenal. So we see an opportunity there. But it's still constrained. There's still pressure. Eric, what else are you add to that?
Eric Andersen: Yes. Look, Greg, I would say I'll do the ILS side first is -- ultimately, we're seeing investors that have historically invested in cat bombs, either allocate more to it, so they see opportunity. Investors that had walked away from the area have sort of returned as well as new. So you're seeing some expanded sort of market opportunity, which is why I think that market has been so dynamic in the first 6 months. I think on the overall capital provision of the reinsurance market, you're starting to see an equilibrium. You're seeing the big players get more active, who see opportunities, especially on the property cat side. And so -- and you're seeing investors look to participate in support, either through their funds or other ways, not necessarily in new company creation, which is sort of what would normally happen in the cycle but more in support of existing players who are already leaders in the industry. So we're getting to an equilibrium around pricing of property cat. Certainly, as you go into the 1/1 renewals in 5 months, there'll be talk of inflation, there'll be talk of what happens over the hurricane season in the summer and other events. But I do think that as the market has moved, it has found an equilibrium in property cat as well as on the casualty side of the business.
Operator: Next question is coming from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
David Motemaden: Just had a follow-up question on commercial risk. You guys spoke about this a couple of quarters ago, I believe it was the fourth quarter, you said the capital markets activity had a 5-point drag on the organic growth in commercial risk. Could you size how much of a drag that had on organic growth in commercial risk this quarter?
Christa Davies: So we have not disclosed that detail. We did, as you mentioned, disclosed it in Q4 and we haven't disclosed it going forward. What I can say is we're the leader in the space, and we're incredibly excited about our capabilities, as Greg and Eric have described. and this having a real impact on our business. But we're continuing to invest in it because we know as M&A volume comes back, this business is incredibly well positioned to do fantastically well.
Greg Case: And David, we continue to reinforce literally the exact guidance we had before. And as we think about where we were, they look greater for the year overall for the business, even in the face of this challenge that Christa described.
David Motemaden: And also just to clarify, so tough comps in this business in the second half of '22 -- or I guess the comps are definitely easier. I think second half of '22 is very depressed. So -- is it that you guys -- you guys aren't expecting it to be down again off of that depressed base, but it's more just you don't see a recovery off of that depressed base? Is that the right way to put it?
Greg Case: It's literally as simple as you almost listen to the investment bank calls. We can talk to the CEOs of those divisions. As that activity comes back, we are incredibly well positioned, not just in the core areas we've done before, but also with the broader commercial applications, as Eric described before. So we've just gotten stronger. Literally as the transactions come back and the volume comes back, we're there. And so you can predict as well as anyone. All we're trying to do is be clear.
David Motemaden: And then just on the continued investment in tech and talent, and it also sounds like even with the increased outlook on CapEx for the year, it's going to tick down in the back half of the year. And I'm just trying to just compare that to the continued investment in talent that it sounds like you guys are making. Should I take that to mean that more of the expenses are going to be coming through OpEx, instead of running through CapEx and then there could be a little bit more of a headwind to margin improvement in the second half.
Christa Davies: So what we really said was we've given guidance on CapEx, $220 million to $250 million. Yes, you're absolutely right. CapEx is a little slight loaded with how the projects worked out this year. But we do think about it over the course of a full year, CapEx, $220 million to $250 million for 2023. In terms of margin expansion, we expect full year margin expansion. We are on track for mid-single-digit organic -- mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin expansion for the full year and double-digit free cash flow growth. And so yes, things are pattening slightly more in the first half in terms of some expense growth and CapEx growth. But really, you should think about these things over the course of the full year.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Meyer Shields: I guess we're all digesting just how significant the M&A practice is in terms of revenues. I hoping you could give us some guidance on sort of how to think about the margin impact, whether it's what you've seen in recent quarters, or what that implies for margin expansion when this business line recovers?
Christa Davies: Yes. So thank you so much, Mark. What I would tell you is we are on track for full year margin expansion. And the margin in this business we continue to manage the business as an overall portfolio. And I would say they're not particularly different to the rest of the business. We are focused on continuing to invest our entire portfolio in higher-revenue growth, higher-margin areas supported by -- and as a services with the analytical impact. And what I would say is, as you think about margin expansion long term, it's really just another way to measure the value we create for clients, which is why our data analytics and insight matter so much because that's increasingly what drives value as our clients look to understand forward-looking risk. And so it's those areas of the business that generate more value for clients. And then obviously, with Aon Business Services, we're driving to create that value more efficiently, which is why we're really investing in Aon Business Services to get it to the next level around driving operational excellence, better customer service and increased innovation at scale. And so we're really confident about driving sustainable margin expansion in 2023 and each year beyond that.
Meyer Shields: Second question, I know you typically don't disclose expected tax rates and unless you want to change the approach now. I was hoping you could let us know, given OECD minimum tax reform, internally, so you -- are you expecting the tax rate to go up?
Christa Davies: So Meyer, as you exactly predicted, we are not giving guidance on the tax rate going forward. As I look back historically, exclusive of the impact of discrete items, which can be positive or negative, and historic underlying rate over the last 5 years was 18%. So we feel really good about our overall global capital structure, our global cash structure and our ability to navigate regulation and legislative changes going forward.
Operator: Our last question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Jimmy Bhullar: So first, I just had a question for Christa on how you think about the impact of inflation on your results? Obviously, it helps on the revenue side. But to the extent there's competition for talent or higher IT expenses than it hurts on margins. But assuming inflation stays high, is that a positive for you overall? Or is it a negative or a push?
Christa Davies: So what we would say is inflation overall is good for our business. And what we've seen so far is the inflationary impact on our expense base. You saw compensation impacted in '21, '22 and again in the first half of '23. We've seen that come through on the expense base. What we're starting to see come through is inflation impacts on the revenue side, whether that's increased asset values or whether that's medical and health care inflation. So it's impacting commercial risk and health insurance prices and therefore, our revenue lines. And we expect that impact on inflation to come through in our revenue over the next 12 to 24 months. And so we would expect that positive side of inflation to start coming through. But Eric, anything else you'd add here on inflation?
Eric Andersen: Yes. Listen, I think how asset values are repriced. I think that is something that's been sort of re-put into the business in a more consistent way, especially on the property side. I think inflation around verdicts on the liability side. So I think it is that you're saying, impacting pricing from an insurer standpoint. I would say it also creates sort of decision-making that the client will make. So the clients may take higher retentions, they may use captives that requires different support. It may -- they may take things on their own balance sheet versus transferring it. So it's not a straight line and often, it will turn into other capabilities that we can provide clients service for, rather than just straight up insurance pricing. So the clients are reacting to inflation the way any business would. And so that gives us an opportunity to provide a broader suite of capabilities to them as they're managing it.
Jimmy Bhullar: And then on share buybacks, the last few years, they've been heavier in the second half than in the first half. Should we assume a similar pattern this time and especially considering that your free cash flow is going to be higher as well? Or does the buyback activity thus far this year already incorporate the higher free cash flow in the second half?
Christa Davies: Yes. So Jimmy, what we would tell you is we think about allocating cash based on return on capital, cash on cash return and our highest return on capital opportunity remains share repurchase. And so as we generate cash, you can think about us allocating it disproportionately to buy back. Because it sets the bar for all other uses of cash. And look, what we would say is we don't actually forecast buyback by quarter. But you can see in any calendar year, it's the highest use of cash across the firm. And so whether that cash is coming from debt or operating cash flow, as we generate that cash, we'll utilize it to buyback or M&A or organic investment, depending on the ROIC return. And we definitely see a huge opportunity to invest in buyback given we are substantially undervalued today, based on the way we value our business on a DCF basis.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: I just want to say that thank you, everyone, for joining, and we look forward to the discussion next quarter. Have a great day.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-28 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to also remind parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historic results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2023 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. Before we begin, as always, we want to thank our colleagues for the great work they're doing every day around the world, to help our clients and each other. We continue to live in a world where volatility, complexity and uncertainty are increasing. And in this environment, our clients are being asked to make decisions faster than ever. And as a result, we see strong and ongoing demand for our advice and solutions, as many of our clients realize that remaining in defensive or reactive mode is not sufficient.  And in fact, a pivot to offense is ultimately necessary to win and achieve their objectives. Clients are telling us, there are two primary areas where they're urgently looking for a competitive advantage, risks and people. Addressing these challenges requires that we bring this out from across our firm, to enable our clients to make better decisions, which is the core Aon United.  Given these ongoing demands our strategy positions Aon as uniquely capable, of helping clients go on offense and make better decisions that mitigate risk to their business and maximize the impact and engagement of their people. Take ESG or Environmental Social and Governance as an example. These are major interconnected categories that cut across traditional silos. Our clients need a broad strategic view to understand and assess all the risks around ESG. And any targeted solutions and capabilities to solve for these risks. Our recently published ESG impact report describes our work helping clients address these issues as well as the impact across our firm. And we're delighted to report on our own progress against long standing commitments in these essential areas. First, on environmental, we're making progress toward our goal of net zero emissions by 2030. And reduced our overall Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions footprint by 16% from our 2019 baseline, and by 4%, in 2022, enabled by efforts like smart working and supplier centralization through Aon Business Services. On Social and specifically around our colleagues, Aon United is not just a strategy, it's our culture, and it reflects our commitment to inclusion, diversity, and the wellbeing of our colleagues. This year, we're continuing to embed I&D principles and practices and to hold ourselves accountable with the increased transparency and oversight at all levels of the organization. Starting at the top with our Board of Directors.  On Diversity, for example, we reported progress in 2022, and the percentage of female people managers, in U.S. ethnically and racially diverse managers. In 2022, we also enhance focus on learning, development, engagement and wellbeing, because we know that supporting our colleagues is not only the right thing to do for them, but it also ensures we retain grow and develop the best talent to continue to support our clients. And finally, on Governance. We've highlighted Board review of top ESG and climate related risks and actions from our ESG senior committee, as well as steps on cybersecurity and privacy all align with our long standing overall enterprise risk management strategy. While we're proud to report on these steps in our report, there's still work to do. And at the same time, we're even more excited about the work we're doing to help clients as many risks connected to progress on ESG align with our core businesses. On the people side for example, we continue to develop new solutions while bringing together existing capabilities across different markets and geographies, to address specific needs. One recent client, facing significant organizational change realize many of our employees were unsure and unclear about titles, career ladders, compensation mechanics, and at the same time, this client needed to reduce costs increase efficiency and simplicity, which they knew would drive engagement.  To address. We brought expertise from around the firm. Our commercial risk team brought deep understanding of this client strategy and desired culture. Our Aon Business Services platform served as a powerful example of how we could help them simplify their operations and reduce costs. Finally, our health and human capital themes brought a series of solutions, including optimization and global benefits, and as skills taxonomy strategy to increase employee alignment, and engagement. Now the solution leverages many existing offerings, so real innovation was bringing these pieces together, along with our Aon Business Services team, who provided insight and change management expertise around moving to a business services model, an essential piece of the puzzle for our clients. The result, our client is driving increased engagement with a clearer more effective benefit structure and talent strategy, and outsourcing capabilities that will help drive simplicity and efficiency all enabled by our teams coming together as Aon United. And we see examples like this across the firm every day, that we help our clients manage risks and support their people. They demonstrate the opportunity we have to continue delivering innovative solutions at scale to address our client’s unmet needs at a time when doing so has never been more important. Turning to financial performance. In the first quarter, we delivered very strong organic revenue growth across our Solution line, with 9% growth and reinsurance, 8% growth in Health Solutions and 6% growth in both Wealth Solutions and Commercial Risk Solutions. In reinsurance, our teams were exceptional in guiding our clients to the 1/1 renewal environment, demonstrating the strength of our team's advice, data driven analytics, modelling and execution capabilities. In Health Solutions, we saw strength in core H&P and human capital in a seasonally larger quarter for European health renewals. As our team has helped clients navigate the ongoing challenging environment for their people, encompassing employee health, rewards, engagement and wellbeing. In Wealth Solutions, our team delivered another very strong performance with 6% growth, driven by ongoing trends around regulatory changes, like GMP Equalisation, pension risk transfer, and the lingering impact of the fixed income market volatility. As our teams help clients reassess and potentially adjust their strategies. We would note that after two very strong quarters Q2 '23 will be impacted by performance fees in the prior year period. And finally, Commercial Risk Solutions grew 6% in the quarter with strength in Europe and UK and are seasonally largest quarter. Overall, we observe the property market remains an area of increasing challenge and volatility. Market dynamics are causing reinsurers to shift risk appetites, regarding primary carriers looks at more risk, which in turn means property placements are even more challenging for our clients.  In this environment, our strength and analytics and the ability to respond to clients need for cover at a capital agnostic way, bringing capability across reinsurance, and commercial risk is essential. Our capabilities enable us to assess and analyse integrated working options, including traditional risk placing, wholesale, MGA, facultative, captives, and insurance like securities.  By helping clients and sets options across capital sources, we ensure that we’re able to optimize their own total cost of risk, and risk appetite. For example, one client came to us looking to consolidate to a single property insurance program across 11 asset classes. With over 80 billion in property values. Our team came together seamlessly across geographies and specialties, to develop a program that leverage traditional carriers around the world and accounted, successfully completing the program and driving significant cost savings for our clients. All enabled by the work we've done to break down barriers within our firm through Aon United. Overall, in the quarter, we're pleased with performance of the strength of our Aon United strategy and our business services platform, translated 7% organic revenue growth, it is 70 basis points of operating margin expansion, net of ongoing investment in the business for long term growth. In this period of ongoing external volatility, and increasingly interconnected risks, the opportunity for us to help clients is greater than ever, position us very well to continue driving results in 2023 and over the long term.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for a thought on our financial performance and long term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies:  Thanks so much, Greg. And good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we just have a strong operational performance in the first quarter highlighted by 7% organic revenue growth that translated into 70 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. This is a strong start to the year and we're very well positioned to continue driving results in 2023 and over the long term. As I reflect on the quarter, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 7%, driven both by ongoing strong retention and net new business generation. We continue to expect mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term. I would also note that reported revenue growth of 5% includes an unfavourable impact from changes in FX of 3%, driven by primarily by a weaker Euro versus the U.S. dollar, as Q1 is our seasonally largest quarter for Euro denominated revenues. I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in our organic revenue growth was $52 million, or 1.4%. Moving to operating performance, we delivered strong operational improvement with adjusted operating margins of 38.7%, an increase of 70 basis points driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from Aon Business Services. Overcoming expense growth, including some investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth, and some ongoing resumption of T&E, especially compared to the prior period when business travel was still suppressed by COVID-19. Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2023 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline, and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. As we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course for the full year, driven by three areas. The first is top line revenue growth. The second is portfolio mix shift for high margin businesses as we invest disproportionately in areas of increasingly client demand, supported by data driven solutions. And the third area is increased operating leverage from ongoing productivity improvements from our Aon Business Services platform. Our highlight, Aon Business Services continues to be a key contributor to margin expansion, and represents a competitive advantage, especially in inflationary markets. Our Aon Business Services platform continues to drive efficiency gains, improved quality and service and increased innovation at scale.  And related to Aon Business Services, I'd like to highlight the essential role of Aon Business Services in enabling our climate net-zero goals. As a professional services firm, the biggest part of our own emissions is from our supply chain. Through the Aon Business Services organization, 90% of the spend is managed through preferred channels, which enables us to drive efficiency and also deploy decarbonisation strategies. As Greg said, this resulted in a 4% reduction in emissions last year, while also allowing us to increase supply diversity utilization to 6% of our addressable U.S. spend in support of our goals around inclusion and diversity, both meaningful accomplishments that are enabled by our Aon United strategy. Organic growth and margin expansion translated into adjusted EPS growth of 7%. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was an unfavourable impact of approximately $0.14 per share. If current data remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an unfavourable impact of approximately $0.04 per share in the second quarter and $0.14 per share for the full year 2023. I'd also note other expense had a $0.19 per share unfavourable impact in the quarter, including a $0.05 per share unfavourable impact from an increase in non-cash net periodic pension costs, in line with what we communicated previously, as well as an unfavourable impact from a gain on sale of business in the prior year period and balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period.  We expect the $0.05 per share unfavourable impact from increased net periodic pension costs to continue for each quarter this year, and we currently expect gains on divestitures to be immaterial for the full year. Turning to free cash flow and capital allocation. I'd note Q1 has historically been our seasonally smallest quarter from a cash flow standpoint, due primarily to incentive compensation payments. And as we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. Free cash flow decreased 17% to $367 million, primarily driven by higher cash tax payments and a $53 million increase in CapEx. CapEx was elevated in the first quarter compared to the prior year period as we initiated a number of projects, with spend heavily weighted in Q1 across technology to drive long-term growth and real estate aligned with our smart working strategy. I'd note, CapEx can be lumpier quarter-to-quarter, and we expect an investment of $200 million to $225 million to 2023. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments on a disciplined ROIC basis.  Our outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond remains strong, and we continue to expect double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvements. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest ROIC opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by approximately $550 million of share repurchase in the quarter. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities that we can scale to address unmet client needs. Our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In Q1, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior notes, consistent with our past practice, and expectation to add incremental debt as EBITDA grows over the long term, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. Factoring in this issuance, I'd note that our term debt is all fixed rate, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 11 years. Our first quarter results reflect strong operational performance, driven by our Aon United strategy. We start the year in a position of strength and expect to continue to make progress on our key financial metrics and our commitment to drive long-term shareholder value creation. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Jimmy Bhullar : Hey, good morning. So first, I just had a question on your expectations for the tax rate for 2023. It was high. I think it was around 19.5% in the first quarter. That's higher than the 17% to 18% range you've had the last few years. But what drove that? And what are your expectations for the tax rate for this year?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question, Jimmy. As you know, we don't give guidance on the tax rate going forward. But if I look back historically, exclusive of the impact of discrete items, which can be positive or negative in any quarter, our historical underlying rate has been 18% for the last five years.
Jimmy Bhullar: And then the changes in Singapore and a few other places, should those have a material impact? Or is there any reason to expect the rate to be different this year than in the past?
Christa Davies: Jimmy, we feel really confident about our overall capital structure for the company. We're domiciled in Ireland, we run a global capital pool, and we run a global cash pulling structure, and that gives us enormous flexibility as we think about any future legislation.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just lastly, on fiduciary investment income, assuming rates stay where they are, is there further ramp-up in that, that you'd expect as like your portfolio sort of resets to where rates have gone? Or has the full impact of the rise in rates over the past several quarters, is it already reflected in your numbers?
Christa Davies: Yes. So what we would say is, as we roll through, we really saw the pickup in fiduciary investment income in Q3 last year. So you'll see the upside in Q2 and then less as we move through the rest of the year. I would note, as you think about our overall fiduciary balances, we have, on average, $6.5 billion of fiduciary investment -- of fiduciary assets. And every 100 basis point increase in the short end of the interest rate curve is $65 million, top line and bottom line. You should think about those fiduciary assets, Jimmy, as split roughly 50-50 between the U.S. and international.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. You mentioned in the release that the U.S. grew modestly in terms of organic revenue growth in Commercial Risk Solutions. And transaction in M&A was probably with a very tough comp. So it looks like as we get into the second quarter and the rest of the year, that's really not a tough comp anymore. Could you give any sense of what that impact was in the quarter? And should we expect going into the next three quarters that we could see a significant contribution to organic growth?
Greg Case: So first of all, Andrew, thanks very much for the question. We appreciate it. We would observe, by the way, across the board, as you think about sort of growth for the quarter, it's been a strong quarter for us, 6% organic across all the solution lines. I think it may be the first time we've accomplished that in a long time, and it's really been terrific. On the U.S. side, it's an exceptionally strong business. You highlighted a great very, very strong comp last year and then just very, very strong capability in the specialty areas that a few of which have been under pressure. But we continue to invest in them because we know they're going to be terrific long term. So for us, listen, continued momentum across the board. And as the market shifts a bit on the M&A and transaction side, we're going to obviously benefit from that. Eric, anything else you'd add?
Eric Andersen: No, Greg, I think you covered it well. I think it's still foundationally very strong. The work that we're doing for our clients today on the commercial risk side with all that's happening in the market, whether it's risk analytics, captives, the broad suite of capabilities we can help them with as they're navigating the market dynamics, are still very strong. And so pretty positive on it.
Andrew Kligerman: So basically, just tell me if I'm interpreting it right, with all these amazing things you're doing, you had a pretty big drag from transaction M&A., that goes away, we could see potentially an even better organic growth quarter next quarter?
Eric Andersen: I would say the first quarter last year was a very strong quarter for commercial risk. The Transaction Solutions business, I think, as Greg said, great capability subject to, obviously, some outside market dynamics that -- but we feel really strongly about that team. And when that comes back, certainly holding that skill set for us is such a great value driver for clients that we're excited about it.
Andrew Kligerman: Got it. Okay. And then Christa mentioned about $200 million to $225 million of CapEx expenditure targeted for this year. You're doing so many interesting things with ABS and other technologies. Anything stand out that you're investing in right now that will drive future growth?
Christa Davies: I mean, the CapEx that I mentioned, the $200 million to $225 million, Andrew, I would say, is primarily focused on IT investments to drive long-term growth. So whether that's scale investments in our platforms to help clients innovate or whether that's in security and infrastructure to keep our clients better protected and the firm better protected, and so we're investing a lot in our Aon Business Services platform, better connectivity, better data analytics, better insight. And it's really helping our clients deliver great value to our clients -- our colleagues deliver great value to our clients.
Andrew Kligerman: Got it. Great. And then just last quickly, M&A pipeline and any areas of interest right now? Should we expect anything as the year progresses?
Christa Davies: Yes. Thanks for the question. We have a fantastic M&A pipeline, and it is focused on our highest growth, highest margin, highest return on capital opportunities. And it reflects the areas we continue to invest in, areas of content and capability that we can scale across the firm. In areas like data analytics, you saw us do Tyche and ERM last year in that data analytic intensive area, areas like health and wellness and human capital, areas like our core risk offerings and helping our clients be able to model and manage risk better. And so we've got lots of areas of great opportunity around the globe, and we're really excited about it.
Andrew Kligerman: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. 
Robert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Curious if there's any way you can help us quantify or help better understand the impact that higher T&E and an inflation is having on the expense base?
Christa Davies: So what I would tell you is, if you look at that other general expense, which is up 20%, that is primarily driven by T&E. And the thing I would note is you're comparing it against Q1 2022, which was an unusually low year in terms of -- usually a low quarter in terms of T&E, because of COVID.
Robert Cox: Okay. Got it. And is there anything to sort of look into -- I noticed in the presentation that you added -- that the margin expansion for this year is net of investment in long-term growth. Is that more of just calling out that the things you guys are doing in terms of investing? Or is there something to look into that?
Christa Davies: It's exactly the same as always. So what we would say is we grow margins each and every year. And our margin expansion for the last 12 years has been 1,120 basis points or approximately 90 basis points a year. And that 90 basis points a year over the last 12 years has been a gross margin expansion higher than that, and then it nets to 90 basis points, net of the investments we're making in long-term growth. So that is consistent with the way we drive margins each and every year.
Robert Cox: Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just shifting to the Wealth segment, very strong and above-average growth in Wealth for a second straight quarter kind of despite some headwinds in the investment business. Curious how long you expect these tailwinds could play out? Is it quarters? Is it a year? How long should we be thinking about that?
Greg Case: Listen, as you highlight, Robert, teams have done a terrific job in really over multiple years. We look at the last two quarters, the overall performance exceptional, really reflecting a lot of what's going on in the world out there. The regulatory changes we highlighted around GMP and others, pension risk transfer, and they were just uniquely well positioned to sort of address that. So that's really what's driving the demand from the client standpoint, and the team has done a terrific job. We did highlight in the opening comments, listen, the comp for next quarter is going to be particularly challenging in terms of sort of where we are. But fundamentals, exceptionally strong, and the Wealth has done a terrific job. Eric, what else would you add to that?
Eric Andersen: Yes, the minor point I would say, Greg, is that it's a global answer. We're seeing growth in the U.K., in particular, especially around the guaranteed minimum pension piece, but also in North America and in Europe. And so the retirement side of Wealth has been very strong for us and really like -- and you called out the investment consulting, investment advisory business. So the challenges there will lap eventually, but you've described it right.
Robert Cox: Great. Thanks for the color. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS. Please proceed with your question. 
Weston Bloomer: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I noticed real estate costs were up year-over-year for the first time, I guess, since 2021. Is that primarily just a function of the investments you're making in smart working? And just given the investments in CapEx that you've made, is it fair to assume that, that should continue to grow year-over-year throughout the course of 2023?
Christa Davies: Yes. So the real estate is up 4%. It's reflecting back to office, in fact, reflecting the investments we made in smart working, as you said. Last year was impacted by FX. But look, I would put this in the context, Weston, of we're going to grow margins each and every year. And as I mentioned, that margin expansion over the last 12 years has been 90 basis points a year. And that margin expansion reflects a gross margin expansion much higher than 90 basis points, offset by investments in the business. And then again, on the CapEx point, we've guided to CapEx for the full year of $200 million to $225 million for the full year. That includes the CapEx investments in IT, in long-term growth and in real estate, in our smart working initiatives. And you should expect CapEx to grow each and every year in line with overall expense growth.
Weston Bloomer: Great. Thank you. And a follow-up on the Wealth performance fees. You highlighted a 2Q headwind there. Is there an associated headwind in the back half of the year as well? Or is it just isolated to the second quarter? And is there a margin impact from that as well?
Christa Davies: It is just a Q2 impact. And no, there's not an associated margin impact.
Weston Bloomer: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I guess, goes back to tying together some of the prior discussion on margins, right? So Christa, you guys -- you mentioned the historical 90 basis points of margin expansion that Aon has seen over the past 12 years. So I'm just trying to understand why we shouldn't expect that level, so the 90 basis points, in addition to the benefit that you guys are getting from fiduciary investment income, which I calculate was around 80 basis points this quarter? Or are you choosing to reinvest more in the business because of the strong tailwind we have from higher fiduciary investment income?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question, Elyse. And look, we do think about margins over the course of each year. And as you said, we've driven 1,120 basis points over the last 12 years or 90 basis points a year. And that 90 basis points a year is reflecting a gross margin expansion much higher, net of investments we make in the business each and every year. And we do -- we did see in Q1, 70 basis points of margin expansion, with 80 basis points of favourable impact from fiduciary investment income, Elyse, just as you said, offset by investments in the business, including in our people, technology and an ongoing headwind from resumption of T&E, all of which we manage in a disciplined way based on ROIC. And we think about margins balancing a number of factors, revenue growth, underlying expense growth, investment in our team, T&E and then the puts and takes around fiduciary investment income and FX. And we look at them all together and over the course of a full year and expect to drive margin expansion over the full quarter 2023.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question on reinsurance, right, 9% organic in the quarter. That was stable with the fourth quarter, but I might have thought that just with the really strong rates that we saw during the January one renewals that, that growth might have picked up sequentially. Can you just give us a little bit of a -- just some of the trends that you saw in the reinsurance business that impacted that 9% in the quarter and how we should think about the balance of the year.
Greg Case: Eric, we'll go to you with one disclaimer here. I just want to highlight, if you think about what our reinsurance colleagues have done over the last number of years, it's really been extraordinary and at least they have really driven the level of performance with clients around the globe in a very unique platform that's been terrific.  And remember, again, our efforts aren't -- are connected to rate but not tied to rate. We're helping clients understand, measure and mitigate risk, which means we're shifting programs, doing things that are unique, flexing the muscle around analytics to help them make better decisions. So what we want to see is client growth, which we have seen top line growth, which we've seen and translate into real impact, which we've seen. So I just want to highlight that long-term piece, and we see that playing out over the course of the year. But for the quarter, Eric, additional thoughts?
Eric Andersen: Yes, Greg, thanks. Look, I would say, Elyse, that reinsurance has been a strength-to-strength story for us over the last couple of years. It was a 7% growth in Q1 '22. And honestly, the work that's been done was nothing short of spectacular around the 1/1 renewals. We had double-digit growth, in fact, double-digit growth in our STG Advisory business, significant new wins in Treaty. We feel really good about the performance of the team year-to-date. And looking forward, the work that the team is doing with their insurer clients and others is in demand, right?  What the carriers are trying to do to manage their own portfolios as they navigate this marketplace has really -- our team is providing real value to them as they think through that. So really proud of the work that, that team has done, not only this quarter but over the last several years, and the future looks bright for it.
Elyse Greenspan: And one last one, going back to that Wealth tough Q2 comp comment. You guys saw 3% organic in Wealth last Q2. So was it just that these performance fees were elevated and there were just other businesses that offset that? It just -- it doesn't seem like a tough comp. So I just want to make sure I'm not missing something.
Christa Davies: Yes, it's simply about the performance fee. As you know, Elyse, performance fees are lumpy as we communicated.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
David Motemaden: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I just had a question. It looked like more of the discretionary -- some of the discretionary parts of the business had a good quarter. Travel and events and Commercial Risk Solutions and human capital and health were both singled out in the press release and in the slides. I'm wondering if you could just talk about how the pipeline looks in those businesses, just given that you tend to be a little bit more economically sensitive.
Eric Andersen: Sure. I would say, our health business had a very solid first quarter. The Consumer Solutions part of that was up 9%. Core health and benefits was up significantly. Global Benefits, Human Capital double-digit, both in the analytics and the advisory and data solution spaces. So really solid start for the year for them with a strong pipeline as they go through the rest of the year.
David Motemaden: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then I'm just looking at the CapEx and appreciate the outlook this year, the $200 million to $225 million. If I just look back pre-COVID that is running at that level or above that level, and it's been around $100 million less than that in 2020 and 2021, ticked up in the second half of 2022. I guess I'm wondering, is there -- should we be thinking about a bigger ramp, I guess, as we enter into 2024? Just maybe some of those investments that would have occurred during the COVID year sort of ramp up here as we exit?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question, David. I would say, we expect $200 million to $225 million for 2023. And then it's reasonable to think going forward, 2024 and beyond, that CapEx will grow in line with expenses. So you're absolutely right that 2020 and 2021 will lower, really just because of the COVID situation. And as we return to more normalized levels of CapEx, 2023 is a right normalized level to start with and then grow from there based on overall expense growth.
David Motemaden: Got it. Okay. Okay. And then maybe if I could just sneak one more in. You mentioned a lot, Greg and Christa, just on Aon Business Services. And I was just wondering, taking a step back, how many employees do you have located in Aon Business Services? And where you think you can get that to over the next couple of years? And what sort of margin implications that might have?
Christa Davies: Yes. Look, thank you for the question. And what we would say is we're incredibly excited about Aon Business Services as a core part of Aon business strategy. It's bringing together the firm in one organization led by Mindy Simon, our fantastic COO, and bringing together an organization to drive efficiency, to drive improved service and quality and to drive innovation at scale. Because a lot of the investments we're making, David, you saw in these IT platforms and security and infrastructure, are helping us scale insights and data analytics to clients to actually deliver impact.  And so we're really excited about the potential to drive productivity and margin expansion from ABS, but equally to drive improved service and quality to clients and to allow us to accelerate innovation in one area of the business across all of our countries and all of our clients immediately. And so it's proven to be an amazing competitive advantage for us over the next many years.
David Motemaden: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Jack on for Mike. Just had one follow-up regarding the M&A outlook. First quarter M&A volumes in the brokerage space are down over 25% according to some media reports. So wondering, would Aon consider moving downmarket in terms of employer size into the U.S. or European insurance brokerage, middle-market area where Aon currently isn't a major player, given that some of the private equity players are being less aggressive?
Greg Case: I would say Jack, from our standpoint, as Christa highlighted before, we've got a terrific pipeline, lots of opportunities we see. We're always going to be looking at them in terms of how they're going to strengthen and build our business. So this is really content capability we can scale around the firm. So you might imagine, we look across the entire spectrum, and we continue to do that, looking for these kinds of opportunities at a return on invested capital criteria that sort of meets the benchmark, which is really buying back, which has the standard. So we're looking broad-based and looking for opportunities around the world.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then maybe a follow-up on the more discretionary parts of your business. Some competitors have said that clients are acting as if some project work, which used to be maybe viewed as more discretionary, is now viewed as more necessary in today's world. I guess just any thoughts on that. Is that something that you're also seeing?
Greg Case: Yes. We would -- absolutely. So first, I just want to highlight, if you look back in kind of overall, what's discretionary and nondiscretionary as the baseline, very limited amounts of our business is really discretionary when you get down to it. There's sometimes timing is effective, not this year, but it's not this year, it's next year. And so a very low level from that standpoint. But what you're highlighting is exactly correct.  Complexity is driving demand, and complexity and urgency is driving demand. And analytics around that at which we have make some of the -- some of these what would have been really would be nice to do almost necessary to do, particularly as you think about risk connecting with human capital and the dynamic that comes with that. Eric, why don't you add to that?
Eric Andersen: Yes. I would maybe offer two examples. One is around wellness and the human capital business that historically would have been considered discretionary. You can't have a conversation today with a Chief People Officer who is thinking about health overall, including wellness as people think about return to work, how they engage their own colleagues. And so that is becoming more of a blended discussion than ever before. And the other piece, I think, Greg, that jumps out is the risk analytics and the advisory work around the commercial risk business that you would have historically said would have been more discretionary in nature. Today, as the clients are thinking through how they navigate this challenging market, whether it's captives, whether it's risk studies, trying to understand their total cost of risk and how they can actually manage the process better. Those skills that we're able to bring to clients are in significant demand and feel more a part of the process going forward than maybe on a project-by-project basis, just to give you two examples.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question. 
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks. Two quick ones. First, can we get a little color on what actually drove the performance fees last year? Like what are the -- what was the performance that led to that fee? And when can we expect that sort of thing to recur?
Eric Andersen: I would look at it as an asset under management discussion in terms of the volatility of the market. And so as that comes back around, you'll begin to see more of a stable platform on that. But that's what drove it in the second quarter.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Fantastic. That's perfect. And second question, Greg, I think this is for Greg. So we saw almost 200 basis points of improvement in the comp ratio. Should we think about that as improved efficiency? Or is there a concern maybe that there are some roles that need to be filled?
Greg Case: So it's overall -- I mean sort of overall, as you think about, Meyer, where we are sort of in the process, we were looking at this across holistically, what we're doing, continuing, as Christa said, make investments across the business to strengthen the business to years units do that. Aon Business Services underneath that drives efficiency, which Christa described. I do want to emphasize, it's not just efficiency. Aon Business Services is so much more than efficiency. It is innovation at scale and it is better service and capability, but it does drive efficiency. Let's be clear. It helps individual colleagues be more effective in serving clients and then groups of colleagues more effective serving clients. So you're seeing that reflected in all through. But we have continued to make really substantial investments in talent and content capability, and we'll continue to do that. Christa, what else would you add to that?
Christa Davies: The thing I would say, Meyer, is you're observing lumpiness in expenses in any one quarter, and we really think about margin expansion over the course of a full year. And we commit to drive margin expansion in 2023 and every year after that. And we think about margins over the course of the full year. And we're balancing a number of factors, including investments in people, T&E and IT as well as the impacts of FX and fiduciary investment income, all with the overall goal of delivering adjusted margin expansion net of sustainable investment and long-term growth. And that's exactly what's happening in Q1 and will happen for the rest of 2023.
Meyer Shields: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. 
Michael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I think you guys implied that the T&E headwind was much larger in the first quarter. I was wondering if that means you expect more margin expansion over the balance of the year.
Christa Davies: Michael, we don't give margin expansion guidance for the full year. What we can say is over the last 12 years, we've driven 1,120 basis points of margin expansion or approximately 90 basis points per year. It is -- we expect to drive margin expansion each and every year. It's not neatly 90 basis points per year because it's lumpy. And it really what it is. It's us driving gross margin expansion net of investments. And the amount we invest every year is dependent upon our opportunities for long-term growth. I would say, specifically on your T&E point, T&E was a bigger headwind this quarter because Q1 '22 had a very low T&E expense, given what was going on with COVID.
Michael Ward: Got it. Okay. And then a somewhat different question. I wanted to ask about the IT solutions business. I believe it's somewhat small for you guys. I think you've quoted like $1 billion of lending that you've helped achieve there. So I was just hoping you could maybe discuss this business and maybe quantify as earnings or revenues, if possible, and maybe even size that -- the market of this business.
Greg Case: Michael, first of all, thanks for raising it. I'm happy to address it. And Eric and I can give both -- give his color commentary on this, too. But this is a phenomenal area. If you think about sort of things we do every day to move to the market, this is an area in which you step back, I think, total addressable market, what could that be?  Well, start at zero right now and what could it build to? 85% of the world's value is connected back in tangible assets. So my gosh, what should this be? By the way, what has our industry done to defend those assets? Nothing today, until we started to really understand how to value IP such that it could be insured, which means it's a real tradable asset, which means you can borrow against it. And you're right, we've done a number of deals over the course of the last 18, 24 months, which has amounted to $1 billion of debt, which is fantastic. It means these entrepreneurs are raising growth capital without giving up ownership. But just think about that, raising growth capital without giving up ownership, who's interested in doing that if you're an entrepreneur?  And the answer is that market is massive. It's going to take time to develop. It takes time to build markets as it always does. And we love the momentum, and we love the possibilities and potential. We're not going to quantify what it needs. We'll see it will play out over time, but it really does have a very specific application, and we're quite excited about the progress. Eric, what else would you add to that?
Eric Andersen: Yes. Maybe just to go a little bit on it. Certainly, the CPI lending piece is what we have been talking about the most that's probably the most advanced in terms of the valuation process. But you've also got M&A due diligence around IP. You've got traditional IP liability where a corporate is not actually trying to lend against it but want us to protect it.  But to make all that happen, you need a couple of things, right, which is what we've been building over the last period of time. You need the valuation, right? How do you actually value IP, both in an upmarket and a stressed market? How do you liquidate it? How do you get insurer partners to devote capital to it to understand the risk themselves, to trust the valuation process, to understand how you would liquidate an example?  So there's a whole ecosystem that we've been building that we are very optimistic about. And as Greg said, we've been building it a little bit each time. And the team is focused or connected in with our commercial risk partners as they build market. They're connected into understanding how to get it in front of clients and build the financial institution relationships. So there's a lot to it that has been happening for us. And we're excited about the future of it and started to see a little bit of progress last year.
Michael Ward: Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Josh Shanker: Thank you all for taking my questions. And good morning to you. First quarter is the strongest quarter for the reinsurance segment, obviously. In the back half of last year, you had a lot of acquisition-related growth in reinsurance not so much in 1Q, I mismodelled it, I'm just looking at 2Q which is a smaller quarter for revenues and reinsurance. Are you going to help me think about the acquisition revenue piece for 2Q later in the year? But given that volatility over the last three quarters, trying to be smart about it?
Eric Andersen: Why don't I take a crack at it? Listen, we -- the reinsurance business is kind of almost a tale of two halves. Certainly, the first half is much more dominated by Treaty business. Think about that through the first half of this year as always. Still some good facultative business. And obviously, with the acquisition of Tyche, the ability to do those advisory services throughout the year.  The second half is much more weighted to capital market transactions, i.e., cat bonds as well as facultative reinsurance and then some casualty reinsurance that tends to go through the year as well. But if you're trying to think through the weighting of the year, property cat, which is what a lot of people focus on, is largely done by the end of June, if that helps.
Josh Shanker: In terms of the acquisition, is there a property cat in that acquisition?
Eric Andersen: I'm not exactly sure by what you mean by acquisition.
Josh Shanker: I'm saying that your 9% boost to revenues in the back half of '22 in the reinsurance segment due to acquisitions and only 1% in 1Q, I assume there's a 12-month impact on any acquisitions you make. It was less pronounced because of the volumes, I guess, in 1Q. I'm trying to think -- yes, yes.
Eric Andersen: So the acquisition around Tyche was much more advisory services, less property cat, but more pricing support and data and analytics support for those clients. A lot of the activity in the second half of last year was driven by FAC and cat bonds. So I would say that's how I would think about it.
Josh Shanker: Okay. And then I want to follow up a little bit on...
Christa Davies: And, Josh...
Josh Shanker: Yes, go ahead.
Christa Davies: Well, sorry, Josh, we closed Tyche in Q1. And so you will see Tyche growth included in organic growth from Q2 onwards. It will be under, as Eric said, our strategy and technology group with be advisory part of reinsurance.
Josh Shanker: That's perfect. Thank you, Christa. And I just wanted to follow up on Mike's question about T&E just a little bit. Clearly, there's a variance between 1Q '23 T&E and 1Q '22. But in my mind, I would imagine the variance would have been greater between 4Q '22 and 4Q '21. And maybe I’ll tell us a little something about the business cycle and whatnot. If you're spending more on T&E now, is that a broad situation with regards to a resumption of how your clients are spending? And two, should we expect that T&E headwind is really a '23 event more so than a '22 event?
Christa Davies: Great question, Josh. And so what we would say is, look, we wouldn't overly read into any one quarter. It's lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And what we would say is, think about margin expansion for the full year, which is driven by a lot of things. It's been driven by our investment in people and technology to drive long-term growth, offset by some investments in T&E, a headwind from FX. There's a lot of things going into this charge. But really, that's why we come back to margin expansion for the full year 2023, similar to the margin expansion we've driven over the last 12 years of 1,120 basis points or approximately 90 basis points a year.
Josh Shanker: Well, I appreciate you staying on message. And thank you very much, Christa. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Greg Case for closing comments.
Greg Case: Thanks very much. Just want to say to everyone, we really appreciate you joining the call and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to also remind parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historic results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results as well as having been posted on our website. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We begin today by thanking Aon colleagues around the world. Our strong performance in the fourth quarter and through 2022 and our strong momentum as we start 2023, continues to reflect tremendous dedication by our colleagues and the power of our Aon United strategy to support clients, both in their demands of today and as they plan to address their needs of tomorrow. 2022 was a year in which we continue to see clients focus on both the challenges and opportunities from increasing global risk and the opportunities to engage clients continues to grow. In commercial risk, our latest weather climate and Catastrophe Insight report sized global economic losses from natural catastrophes at $313 billion, 4% over the 21st century average and it was only 42% covered by insurance, $190 billion protection gap. In Wealth Solutions, equity and fixed income market volatility in the back half of the year created demand for our Wealth Solutions colleagues to help organizations reassess retirement readiness and financial well-being. And in Health Solutions which includes our human capital business, the continuation of broad trends around a changing workforce, encompassing health, culture, wellness, engagement and inclusion, our growing and focus and importance across the C-suite and the stakes have never been higher. In this environment of increasing risk and complexity across so many fronts, our colleagues are increasingly relying on Aon United. This would enable them to bring the full force of our firm, including core offerings and innovative solutions at scale to address evolving client demand. Turning to financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5%, highlighted by 9% growth in reinsurance, 7% growth in Health Solutions and 6% growth in Wealth Solutions. In reinsurance, our teams were able to deliver strategic advice and data-driven analytics very early on in the renewal process to help clients navigate difficult market dynamics. This market leadership benefited our clients greatly in a challenging 1/1 renewal and reflects our strong performance. In Health Solutions, we saw strength in our core H&P and human capital. Both of which benefited from enhancements to our offerings, tools and platforms and increased client focus on employee health, rewards, engagement in well-being. In Wealth Solutions, our team delivered the strongest quarterly organic revenue growth in over 5 years. As our teams worked tirelessly to respond to client demand resulting from market and interest rate volatility, particularly in the U.K. and continue to help clients execute on pension risk transfer, strategic pension management and respond to regulatory changes. And finally, commercial risk grew 4% in the quarter and 6% for the year. We delivered double-digit organic revenue growth in Canada and Latin America and strong growth in Europe, the U.K. and Asia Pacific. In the U.S., otherwise strong results continue to reflect the impact of the external M&A and IPO environment on M&A services. This impact reduced quarterly organic growth by 5%, an annual growth by 2.5%. And while this short-term pressure may continue into Q1, over the long term, we are very well positioned in this highly attractive business but has significant opportunity to contribute to long-term top and bottom line growth. For the full year, our organic revenue growth of 6% is a direct result of our Aon United strategy and is a key driver of strong top and bottom line results for the full year. Noting adjusted operating margins expanded 70 basis points to 30.8%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 12% to $13.39, overcoming a 3% or $0.44 FX headwind. Free cash flow exceeded $3 billion with free cash flow margins of 24.2%, both our highest ever and we completed $3.2 billion of share buyback, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term value of the firm. Our team's performance positions us exceptionally well to deliver in 2023 and over the long term. Looking back, since 2010, we've reported 4% average organic revenue growth. Over 1,100 basis points of margin expansion or about 90 basis points per year, while adjusted EPS and free cash flow increased at a compound annual growth rates of 12% and 13%, respectively. More important, we view the go-forward opportunity and momentum higher now than any time in our history. Looking ahead, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the firm, margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term. Reflecting on the year, we would offer a few observations on how Aon United continues to deliver for clients. The steps we've taken over the past decade, including our single brand and single P&L, put us in an exceptionally strong position to deliver for clients and have significant impact on some of the greatest opportunities and challenges they face. These ideas are not new. There are a continuation of over a decade of progress on the areas highlighted in our Aon United blueprint, clients, colleagues, innovation at scale and Aon business services that are increasingly interconnected and mutually reinforcing. On delivering innovation at scale, the platform we've built not only enables innovation of new concepts as we've demonstrated in areas like intellectual property solutions and climate but increasingly enables us to bring together our analytics and expertise for new solution development, both from within solution lines and connected across our business. For example, our Health Solutions team has developed an Aon health analytics platform, supported by hundreds of data scientists and credential health actuaries, as well as experts from human capital and ad business services. It's designed to help clients assess and improve their employees' health which in turn helps deliver well-being, productivity and lower cost. Within this offering, driven by proprietary analytics, we can assess data around employee health information, insurance and claims, workplace safety, absence engagement data and external data on health trends and solutions which together form a robust view of employee physical well-being. With this insight, our teams can recommend individualized solutions, including better insurance offerings and targeted program. As an example, 1 manufacturing client wanted to improve employee physical well-being and reduce costs. Together, we designed a comprehensive long-term well-being strategy and a customized health program that includes 12 vendors and targeted specific health and well-being programs for employees based on individual factors correlated success. The results were impressive. In our target group as compared to nonparticipants, we saw meaningful improvement in selected health metrics at 24% lower cost per person. Further, the platform allows for rapid scale and distribution of a solution to help our clients drive workforce health, wealth and productivity. Equally important, our colleagues while having this kind of impact which is an important driver of our very high Aon colleague engagement. And we see examples like this across the firm every day as we help our clients manage risk and support their people. And this demonstrates the opportunity to continue delivering innovative solutions at scale to address our clients' biggest challenges across the backdrop of rapid change and ongoing volatility. To summarize, we began 2023 in a position of strength. Our firm is more connected than ever before, enabling us to deliver better solutions for clients and to better support our colleagues. Aon United will continue to deliver results now and over the long term for our clients, colleagues and shareholders and is reflected in our progress to achieve key financial objectives. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial progress in Q4 and 2022 and our long-term outlook. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered another strong quarter of performance across our key metrics to finish the year. In the quarter, we translated 5% organic revenue growth into 40 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted earnings per share. For the full year 2022, organic revenue growth was 6%. Adjusted operating margins increased 70 basis points to 30.8% and we generated over $3 billion in free cash flow, an all-time high. We look forward to building on this momentum as we head into 2023. As I reflect on results, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. We continue to expect mid-single digital greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term. I would also note that reported revenue growth of 2% in both Q4 and the full year includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX of 4% in both periods. Primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies. I'd also highlight that fiduciary investment income which is not included in our organic revenue growth, was $41 million in Q4 and $76 million for the full year or 1% in both periods. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement in Q4 with adjusted operating margins of 33.2% an increase of 40 basis points driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth and some ongoing resumption of T&E. For the full year, adjusted operating margin of 30.8% reflects margin expansion of 70 basis points year-over-year. And I'll note over the past 12 years, we delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion a year. Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2023 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. As we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of the full year, driven by 3 areas: the first is top line revenue growth. The second is this portfolio mix shift to higher margin businesses as we invest disproportionately in areas of increasing client demand, supported by data-driven solutions to deliver the insights and advice that help our clients protect and grow their organizations. And third area is increased operating leverage from ongoing productivity improvement from our Aon Business Services platform. I'd highlight that Aon Business Services continues to be a key contributor to margin expansion and represents a competitive advantage, especially in a high inflationary market. Our Am business services platform continues to drive efficiency gains, improved quality and service and increased innovation at scale. During 2022, we continue to make progress on Aon Business Services and driving efficiencies in enhanced services. Particularly through process improvement, automation and the use of artificial intelligence. For instance, our captives business has clients with hundreds of legal entities who each require multiple policies. Previously, the process of checking policies was manual and inefficient. We've now moved to a digital solution that can identify differences quickly and accurately and deliver these to clients much more quickly. Similarly, the use of AI is increasingly enabling us to deliver better solutions to clients. For example, we delivered a new solution for our human capital clients using an AI-powered search engine that provides them with insights on technology talent globally including geography-based pay differentials. This is essential for finding the best technology talent and optimizing within the client's existing workforce, a key area of growth for many firms. As we've said before, these improvements not only improve accuracy and client service delivery, they also help free up our colleagues time for more valuable client activities and drive better outcomes for our clients. Organic growth and margin expansion translated into adjusted EPS of 5% in Q4 and double-digit growth of 12% for the full year. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.09 per share in Q4 and $0.44 per share for the full year 2022. If currencies are remained stable at today's rate, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.13 per share in the first quarter of 2023 and $0.12 per share for the full year 2023. Turning to free cash flow and capital allocation. We generated over $3 billion in free cash flow in 2022, contributing to our long-term track record of growing free cash flow at 13% CAGR since 2010. Our outlook for free cash flow in 2023 and beyond remains strong and we continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvements. I'd note CapEx returned to a more normalized level in 2022 as we made ongoing investments in ABS enabled platforms and technology to drive long-term growth. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments, on a disciplined return on capital basis. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond, we expect share repurchases to continue to remain our highest ROIC opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the approximately $675 million of share repurchases in the quarter and $3.2 billion of share repurchase for the full year. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities that we can scale to address unmet client needs. We've invested in expertise and content to help meet our clients' needs such as our Q4 acquisition of ERM, a Mexico-based leader in risk assessment modeling which expands our catastrophe modeling and consulting capabilities in reinsurance. Our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our highest priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. We ended 2022 with an ROIC of 30.6%, an increase of nearly 1,900 basis points over the last 12 years. Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. We expect to add incremental debt as EBITDA growth over the long term while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. With respect to interest rates, I'd note our term debt is all fixed rate, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 12 years. I'd note our pension liability improved as interest rates increase. As a continuation of our pension derisking efforts, I'd highlight that we completed an annuity settlement transaction in the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately $300 million reduction in our pension benefit obligation. This continues to be an incredibly attractive environment for our clients to do pension risk transfers and we continue to see very strong demand from clients. We've done substantial numbers of pension risk transfers in the U.S. and the U.K. and are a leader in the space. In summary, 2022 was another year of strong top and bottom line performance, driven by the strength of our Aon United Strategy and Aon Business Services. We returned over $3.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. The success we achieved this year continues to provide momentum as we head into 2023. While we're seeing signs of economic uncertainty, we remain confident in the strength of our firm and our financial guidance for 2023. Overall, our business is resilient and our Aon United strategy gives us confidence in our ability to deliver results in any economic scenario. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question is on your margins. So if we look in the quarter, it seems like your margin declined excluding the benefit of fiduciary investment income. So I'm just trying to get a sense of the drivers and outlook you see for your margin, excluding the NII benefit in 2023?
Christa Davies: Yes. Thanks so much for the question, Elyse. That is correct. We saw 40 basis points of margin expansion and 90 basis points of impact from fiduciary investment income. And I would note, we really think about margins over the course of the full year. So 70 basis points of margin expansion in the full year, of which 40 basis points came from fiduciary investment income. And we really think about margin expansion over the long term. Our margin growth has been 1,120 basis points over the last 12 years or 90 basis points a year for 12 years. And it's really driven by revenue growth, the portfolio mix shift to higher margin areas and the productivity benefit we're getting from Aon Business Services. And so we're extremely confident with that track record at least for our financial guidance which is mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin expansion for the full year 2023 and double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2023.
Elyse Greenspan: So assuming we continue to get a tailwind from fiduciary investment income, I guess, in '23, you'll probably balance letting that all fall to the bottom line and making some of the investments similar to what you did in the fourth quarter?
Christa Davies: I think that's fair. We are continuing to drive margin expansion each and every year, overcoming investments we're making in the business because you saw in Q4 we substantially invested in IT. So our IT expense is up. We're investing in platforms and technology to drive innovative solutions for clients. And we'll continue to invest in our colleagues and we'll continue to invest in M&A and we'll continue to invest in a lot of areas to drive long-term growth but we really think about this over the course of a full year which is really what matters to us.
Elyse Greenspan: And then my second question, we've heard a lot about a lot of strong pricing coming out of the January 1 reinsurance renewals. Can you give us a sense of the outlook for your reinsurance business? I am not sure if you highlighted it in the past but the concentration is in the property lines. But can you give us a sense of just how you think that business should perform in an environment where we're seeing as robust catastrophe reinsurance price increases that we saw at January 1?
Eric Andersen: This is Eric Andersen, why don't I take that one to kick us off. It's great to be with you this morning. The reinsurance business continues to be a very strong performer for us as we go through the year. And I would say certainly, a lot of attention spent on property CAT [ph] for good reason. Certainly, the losses, the interest rate moves, the restructurings of the programs that were happening throughout the season. I would say Property CAT [ph] continues to be a dominant part of the business but it's not the whole business. Certainly, casualty, specialty and others continue to be a big part of it. But so I would say, as I think through the future of what's going to happen over the next 12 months, we continue to see a very robust opportunity for the team. They're spending a lot of time with data analytics, better insight to help our primary clients figure out their positioning. But the endgame, I think when you think through the 1/1 renewals is that there's more risk, more volatility has been pushed to the primary insurers. And the outcome of that for them will be either risk appetite. They're going to have to be very disciplined on the risk that they assume in the property space in particular. They'll use other methods like facultative reinsurance, they'll probably do selective buying throughout the year. And so I would say the 1/1 season, a little different than years past which I think is what you're alluding to. And ultimately, they're going to continue to manage their portfolio as the year progresses.
Greg Case: And I might just add to that, at least, the theme was exceptional. I'd tell you, the 1/1 renewals had a unique market dynamic and taking the analytics and capability we have in place and what we're able to do and how we deliver it to the market well before anyone else was truly unique and helped our clients tremendously as they navigated through the marketplace. As Eric highlighted, more risk means more opportunity to demonstrate value added.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.
Andrew Kligerman: In your slides, you described the impact on organic revenues from the market as modest positive impact in both commercial risk and reinsurance. Can you give a little more color on that market impact and maybe discuss the issue of commissions versus fees and whether your fees were kind of level year-over-year or whether commissions were driven down in each of those 2 segments?
Greg Case: Andrew, maybe I'll start and Eric, you can chime in as well here. First, Andrew, we always come back to the idea we talk about market impact. This is a function of prices you're highlighting but also insured values over time. Obviously, a lot is happening on the insured value front. And this is really broadly beyond this property but really as you think about on the employee side and all aspects of sort of what's driven by changes in those values. And that actually has much more impact than just price per se. As we've highlighted, you step back, it really is a modest impact over time. We saw that in this quarter. We think we'll see that throughout the year. And it really for us is about value. We deliver value for clients and we could benefit from that because they get benefit. And we're very, very clear about that. And as Eric highlighted on Elyse's question, in an environment with greater risk, the opportunity to provide greater value is real and meaningful and we're doing it and we're benefiting from it. So that's what you're seeing overall. But Eric, maybe you want to dive a bit more into the specific pricing.
Eric Andersen: Sure. Listen, I think on the property on the market perspective, certainly property is getting a lot of attention and you continue to see that market be challenging for our primary clients. It is worth noting though that clients use a lot of different tools to manage that market dynamic. They use captives, they use retention. They limits purchase. So it's not a direct line from what a carrier would say about a property market rate versus what a client actually assume. So there's a lot of tools that they have and we spend an awful lot of time, as Greg was saying, trying to add additional value for them using financial modeling and techniques to try and limit that exposure. The other products, casualty, cyber, financial products, etcetera, around the globe, I would say, are more stable. We're a good 3.5, 4 years into a market cycle and I think those products are coming more to an equilibrium. And the last thing I would say about your question on commission fees and ties back to what Greg said is one of the benefits of being a fully transparent broker where we engage our clients in what we get paid for the value that we provide, we don't really care whether it's a commission or whether it's a fee. What we really are driven by is are we providing value to clients and are we being paid fairly for that value. And so whether the cycle is up or down, it doesn't really matter to us. We engage in those conversations in a fully transparent way and I think we have great relationships with our clients because of it.
Andrew Kligerman: Okay. So maybe just so I can interpret it that the 4%-plus revenue growth in commercial risk, 9%-plus in reinsurance. Both of them were more a function of what Aon was delivering as opposed to inflationary impacts on exposures and kind of a very firm pricing environment. I should think about it as more Aon [ph] and the very little of these market issues played through. Is that right [ph]?
Eric Andersen: If you think about it -- I'll just use reinsurance as an example. It's historically our smallest quarter and it's not treaty driven. It's driven around facultative placements, banking, our technology consulting group. So not really market-driven issues but more value issues in terms of usage of those tools to help clients manage their exposures.
Andrew Kligerman: Okay. And then just a quick one on the tax rate at 9%. Is that a sustainable tax rate? Or should we be thinking about it kind of drifting up a little bit towards, say, 12% last year in the quarter?
Christa Davies: So what we would say is we don't give forward guidance on tax. But as I look back historically, exclusive of the impact of discrete items which can be positive or negative in any 1 quarter, our historical underlying rate for the last 5 years was 18%. And that's the result of us being a global company domiciled in Ireland with a global cash management structure and a global capital structure. And so we're really confident about where we are.
Andrew Kligerman: Confident. So should I be thinking more towards the 18% [ph]?
Christa Davies: Again, we don't give guidance going forward on tax rate but I can tell you that as we look back historically, our historical underlying rate for the last 5 years was 18%.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: So first, just had a question on your -- some of your comments on the reinsurance market. You mentioned a challenging environment for your clients, especially in property reinsurance. Are you expecting a similar trend for midyear renewals as well? Or do you expect any sort of shifts in capacity entering the market?
Eric Andersen: So Jimmy, right now, we have not seen a lot of new capacity enter the marketplace, although there is certainly a lot of whispers and discussion about whether there's opportunity for additional capital to enter. So I would say as we go into the April 1 property renewals which are dominated by Japan and then June which is dominated by Florida. I think as we sit here today, you would have to think that those market dynamics will continue.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just similarly, on commercial lines, obviously, pricing has been pretty good for a while. It seems like it's softening a little bit, given the results that some of the carriers have reported. Are you seeing something similar in the market, too?
Eric Andersen: Yes, I would say it depends where you are and it depends on the segment, it depends on the industry. I think we like to say there's a million little markets out there depending on each individual client and the business they're in and the type of exposures that are being covered. But then on macro basis, certainly, property, I think, continues to be the firmest as the primary carriers now deal with the effects of higher retained risk that they were traditionally passing on to reinsurers. But whether it's the casualty lines, general liability, cyber, financial lines, D&O, professional that type of thing, we're definitely seeing a stabilizing of that market. As more capital has come into those areas and clients are being given more choices in what they're doing. And I would also say that the insurers are 4 years into remediating their portfolios. And so they're much more specific as to the areas that they choose to compete in and the kind of business that they want to write which does give clients sort of a more targeted choice of potential insurer partners.
Greg Case: Jimmy, in the context of this, if you step back and think about the implications for insurers, as Eric highlighted very well kind of on a product-by-product basis. As I talked, described in my comments and Christa amplified very well, this is really about a client leadership approach for us and fundamental demand is going up. The opportunity to talk to clients about risk out there in the world and how it's connected, it's going up. So irrespective of sort of the individual pricing environment which are prescribed well, the opportunity for us to engage clients and help them how to protect their business and grow is actually continuing to increase.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And just lastly for Christa. On taxes, do you see anything in terms of like a minimum global tax or something that -- based on what's out there right now? And how -- do you have any views on how it would impact your financials?
Christa Davies: Jimmy, we don't comment on any future legislation. We run a global tax structure and we've had an underlying rate of 18% for the last 5 years and we feel really good about where we are.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Rob Cox: And first, maybe just a longer-term question. I think in the past, you've talked about getting margins up into the 40% plus area. I know you don't disclose margins by segment. But curious if you can give us some color on which of your businesses have some of the most opportunity there and if commercial risk could ever get to that level?
Greg Case: Rob, just take a step back for a second, as we've talked about, it really is about mid-single-digit or greater organic growth improving margins overtime and really driving double-digit free cash flow growth for the firm and all aspects contributed. And as you're hearing in our commentary, more and more are connected. The solutions we are providing, some of the most innovative solutions we're providing really are a function of how our commercial risk business, our reinsurance business, health, wealth and talent business has come together. And so we're confident about continuing to drive margin improvement. As we described, organic revenue growth mid-single digit or greater and free cash flow growth double digit. That's how we want you to think about it. That engine is really what's coming together and we're confident we can achieve that on our and our clients' behalf.
Rob Cox: Okay, got it. And maybe just switching to the wealth segment. Obviously, strong growth in the quarter. I was wondering if that was more driven by the pension risk transfers or some of the regulatory changes we're seeing, particularly in Europe. And if your outlook considers a continued tailwind from these areas?
Greg Case: I just would start overall and Eric, I love to add some additional color here. Look, the teams done a phenomenal job. There's a lot going on out there for our clients in this arena, a lot of complexity as we described before and whether it's on the interest rate side or the overall -- general state of the overall economy and what's happening, the pension risk transfer as you've described. So the team has just done an exceptional job really on a global basis helping our clients kind of navigate across very, very challenging marketplaces. And you saw a drop in the year, you certainly saw a drop in the quarter. Eric, what else would you add to that?
Eric Andersen: Listen, I think the regulatory changes with the global minimum pensions is such a big part of the business in the retirement side. So we saw a lot of growth there, especially out of the U.K. but also decent growth in the U.S. as well. There were some headwinds with the investment business because of AUM being down with the market. But overall, I think we're really well positioned. And I think, Christa, you mentioned in your opening comments about the pension risk transfer piece. Also, I think we're an industry leader in that space and really have a great team to do it.
Christa Davies: Look, I'll just finish with what we're doing on the Aon side. We're following the same advice we give clients. And over the last 15 years, we've reduced the risk in our pension substantially through steps to close the plants, new entrants, freeze benefit accrual, matchup liabilities and purchased annuities to settle a portion of the pension liabilities. And it's resulted in much less economic risk and much reduced cash contributions. And so our remaining plans are well funded and hedged. And we're really managing on a cash basis and you can see that our cash contributions have come down substantially over time, with only $65 million we're contributing in 2023 in cash, a continued downward trend in cash. And so we're really excited about the progress we continue to make on our own plans in derisking, as you saw in Q4, with the $300 million of pension benefit obligation coming off the balance sheet and in the decreased cash contributions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS. [Operator Instructions]
Weston Bloomer: Sorry about that. I was on mute. My first question is on the margin. I was hoping you could kind of expand on your margin outlook away from fiduciary income. I guess, would you be able to still expand margins in the core business away from the fiduciary income benefit in 2023? And then where could we potentially see that margin improvement? I would assume lower real estate would be a component of that.
Christa Davies: So Weston, thanks so much for the question. As we think about margin expansion, we think about it holistically over the course of the year at the Aon level. And we've grown margins, as I mentioned, 1,120 basis points over the last 12 years or 90 basis points a year for 12 years. And it's driven by revenue growth a portfolio mix shift as we disproportionately invest in higher revenue growth, higher-margin businesses organically and inorganically and productivity benefit from ABS. So we don't look at it separately from investment income or frankly, the underlying investments we're making in the business each and every year to drive long-term growth and innovation for our clients.
Weston Bloomer: Great. My second question, I know you highlighted that you were seeing some signs of economic uncertainty in your prepared remarks. Can you just expand on kind of where you're seeing those signs of weakness? And then what economic backdrop does your guidance assume?
Greg Case: Excellent. Listen, I appreciate the question. We are seeing uncertainty or complexity or interconnectivity, however you want to describe it, really everywhere around the world. We do want to emphasize, though, this is not just risk, it's opportunity. It's an opportunity to engage clients in ways to help them understand these risks more effectively. And candidly, our clients want to get on the offensive. They want to understand that risk and then actually deal with how they can actually grow their businesses in the context of it. So for us, this is about more connectivity around a changing environment but we're seeing it really over around the globe, the impact of interest rate changes, inflation, geopolitical challenges, really the fundamental issues I described in the opening comments around things like health and wealth and talent. The evolution from just engagement is now wellness and all things that come without all aspects of that. How you think about managing that sort of using reinsurance analytics and commercial risk analytics in the context of people, all of these things are coming together to create opportunity for us and we're really seeing it everywhere in addition to the challenges you described.
Weston Bloomer: Great. And then my last one, a follow-up on tax. I believe you had a tax holiday in Singapore that ran through September of 2022. Was that extended going forward?
Christa Davies: Look, our operations in Singapore, including our investment center and local business are an essential part of our operations today and we expect that will mean an important part of our global strategy going forward. We did finalize our negotiations with the Economic Development Board in Singapore and we'll provide an updated disclosure on our 10-year arrangement in our 10-K.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: I had a question on commercial risk. Greg, you mentioned there was a 5-point drag from the lower transaction volume in the quarter's organic growth. I guess I'm wondering is that going to be a similar size drag as we think about first quarter? Or is it going to be lower or higher? I guess, how should we think about that as we progress through the 2023?
Greg Case: Yes. And David, thanks for the question. Really, we were underlying our commercial risk colleagues working across the firm has done a tremendous job and drove growth, as I described, really everywhere around the world, including in the U.S. with the exception of the external M&A and IPO environment which created a headwind that we described. But even in the context of that, we've just done a magnificent job. As you know, that's an amazing business and we are incredibly well positioned in the context of it. And we'll see how it plays out. We highlighted, maybe it drags into the first quarter with Q2, what happens on the M&A services front. But overall, it's an exceptionally strong performance in terms of what we've done overall. And this is just one piece and as we described before, this is really about overall global Aon and what we can do to grow the firm and we're very excited and confident about how that's going to proceed in '23.
David Motemaden: Got it. Okay. And then I think you guys usually give an update on the calling count at the end of every year. So I think it was 50,000 at the end of 2021. Where did that stand at the end of 2022? Does that grow at all?
Greg Case: Listen, I'm not sure how much we disclose on a specific people because it isn't about the individuals for us from the standpoint, it's how we help them become more effective, more capable -- greater ability to deliver to the firm. And I would say, as we look at that, we've been incredibly pleased with the progress. When you think about overall Aon United and all the aspects around it. And great progress. But I would say we continue to invest tremendously in our colleagues and bringing colleagues on it and you saw that in '22, you'll see it again in '23 and '24.
David Motemaden: Got it. And I guess just a follow-up on that, Greg. You mentioned, I guess, it sounded like just productivity enhancement of your existing employee base. Is -- are there any metrics that you guys track that you can help us think about that?
Greg Case: David, there are lots of metrics. We have them. We don't disclose them. I do think it's worth on this point, in particular, understanding and maybe taking a minute to step back and say, listen, when you think about our ability to drive organic growth, to drive margin improvement, to drive free cash flow improvement, fundamentally, Christa and I both highlighted the role the Aon United strategy plays in that. And it is fundamental and I think it's worth a couple of minutes here, David, to your question. Look, if you think about it, we've been at this for 10 years plus. We saw back then client need was changing. We saw that we need to help them make better decisions to protect and grow their business. We saw, frankly, this accrued across all aspects of risk, not just commercial risk, all aspects of what we're doing, workforce health, talent, etcetera. We also saw we had great capability. But like everyone around the world, it wasn't joined up and it wasn't driving innovation at scale. And we saw that loud and clear, David, in terms of where we are. We also saw, however, there were pieces and pockets when our colleagues work together. We win more clients, we do more with them. We retain them longer and we also deliver better and faster innovation at scale across the firm. And this fundamental truth, 10 years ago for us, created a great deal of excitement but it also created a real challenge which was, okay, that sounds great. Everybody talks about this. How do you do it? How do you accomplish that? And that's the Aon United strategy. And this is back to your critical question, how do we maintain performance and drive it over time. It is in Aon United. The challenge has been as we've evolved it and the opportunity is this required a fundamental design of organization around serving clients, training, learning, how we think about leadership development. Aon Business Service is fundamental to that and some real, frankly, price of admission to really do this, single brand, single P&L, single leadership team, etcetera and we are really bringing that online. And what you heard from both Christa and I and Eric's comments as well is what we've done with Aon United is fundamentally to put us in a position to not just serve clients by solution lines that really cutting across solution lines to bring better capability to them. And in the current environment, the more difficult it becomes for clients, the more opportunity we have to bring value. And that's frankly what you're seeing which is why we are confident in our ability to, frankly, not just make progress over the last decade as Christa highlighted but why we are so excited about the go forward.
Eric Andersen: Greg, maybe I can give a little bit of color with regard to a client example just to bring it to life because I can't stress how important this is for us and what we do for our clients. We were recently engaged by a global firm and a specialized industry who is looking for just better risk advisory services around the world for their risk strategy, both globally and as well as locally. And to do this, we use resources from all of our solution lines in multiple spots. And on the surface, I would say this is the kind of work that we love to do for clients but just thinking about what you were just saying, Greg, when I dig back to what we used to do, right? When we were operating under these sub brands of Aon Risk services, Aon Benfield, Aon Hewitt and the others, it would have been a pretty disjointed process for us. There would have been all sorts of internal barriers within the firm that would have distracted us from the focus on the client. We had internal P&L issues, like resource allocation, revenue sharing, incentive discussions. I think you all get the point. But today, with the Aon United structure, we have 5 region leaders, 4 global solution line leaders who are focused solely on delivering for that client under the Aon brand. With 1 P&L operating around the world. And it is powered by the Aon Business Services model which allows us to actually deliver that capability in a uniform way globally.
Christa Davies: And Eric, I would just say that Aon United sets the stage for Aon Business Services to be successful, I agree with everything you both said. And I would add 3 things. The first is innovation at scale is an essential part of our ability to deliver results for clients as we continue to find applications and solutions developed in 1 area and then scale it to clients globally. We can't do that without Aon Business Services enabling seamless connectivity across the globe. Second, Aon United is not a field of story. It's designed to enable our colleagues in every way, deliver better results for clients which translates into stronger top and bottom line performance. And ultimately, that translates into free cash flow growth, as evidenced by our billion in free cash flow and 24% free cash flow margin as we put our highest and best use of the capital which we believe will continue to drive long-term value creation for shareholders. Translating revenue into free cash flow is a scaled operational outcome and it's done at scale globally in over 100 countries, tracking by day, by country with great accuracy. This is not possible without Aon United and the detailed operating model we've got powered by Aon Business services. It makes us all really excited about the 2023 go-forward momentum and how we scale this operation to deliver innovation for our clients.
Greg Case: So David, that was way more than you asked for on the initial piece that you asked a very important specific question. What we're trying to convey is the answer to that is key but it really is fundamental to sort of how the integrated approach happens and how it drives performance. And how we're not complete with the journey. There's a lot more opportunity ahead of us. And it also connects with our colleagues because they love driving the solutions that Eric described. It creates engagement. It creates excitement around. If you can wow a client, you've done something that is truly kind of makes the week in the month. So it's a huge opportunity and we stress it here because it's so fundamental to our success with our clients and obviously, with all of our investors as partners as well. So hopefully, that's helpful.
David Motemaden: No, thanks so much for the thorough answer. I really appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Charlie [ph] on for Mike. I guess, first, in human capital, organic growth has been really strong for many quarters now. Wondering what the pipeline looks there. Amid macro uncertainty and comps being challenging. And you mentioned tech talent in your opening remarks, is that business benefiting from some of the job market dislocation in tech?
Eric Andersen: So why don't I take the first one. Certainly, human capital has been a very robust business for us over the last 24 months. And it's still -- we still see it. The data sales, the information around comp the competitive talent engagement assessment also very critical to the agendas of our clients. So we feel really good about that business and what it's done over the last 24 months and are confident about it literally over the next 12 to 24 months as well.
Greg Case: And on the tech talent side -- go ahead, Christa. Please go ahead.
Christa Davies: All right. On the tech talent, we've got one of the most fabulous brands in the tech space, Radford. And that was the example I gave on the opening remarks around using AI to actually be able to match and find the optimal tech talent at the right price, anywhere around the world. And then to be able to also figure out where your tech talent is within your existing organization to be able to optimize your workforce. And so we do see that the tech dislocations being a fabulous time to utilize this AI technology to get -- to make sure that our clients get access to the best talent and optimize it in the right way.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then you mentioned cyber pricing kind of being more an equilibrium now. Wondering how Aon's role in the marketplace has evolved over time as that market has grown a lot over the last several years?
Eric Andersen: Listen, I think the cyber market is continuing to evolve and we'll continue to do so as the threat actors change over time. I would say we're a leading provider of both risk management. When you think about data security and the strategy to prevent cyber attack, certainly with our Stroz Friedbeg client -- brand, very strong in terms of its work with clients and then obviously, the risk transfer aspect. I would say when you think about the cyber market today and where it's going, I would say the insurers have actually gone back to basics. The way the quality of the underwriting, the in-depth understanding of what the real cyber exposures are have allowed them to price it better to understand the real risk. And frankly, it's allowed us to distinguish and differentiate our clients and the work that they're doing around cyber protection to be able to bring them to market in a way that gives them individual views but it's become quite a market in terms of size, probably approaching about $10 billion of premium and both from an insurance and a reinsurance side, I consider Aon a market leader in the space.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Han with KBW.
Derek Han: So my first question is on buybacks. It looks like buybacks slowed a little bit in the fourth quarter. Was there anything unusual driving that? I was a little surprised just given the strong operating cash flows.
Christa Davies: No, we would just say that we continue to see across the firm that we deploy cash based on the highest return on capital opportunity. Buyback is top of the list even at today's prices, Derek. And so we -- that's why we bought $3.2 billion back in calendar year 2022. And we expect buyback to remain the highest return on capital opportunity going forward.
Derek Han: Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question is on M&A. We've heard chatter about the M&A market kind of cooling a little bit. Are you kind of seeing that in the market? And -- how does that impact your M&A appetite for this?
Greg Case: Yes. From our standpoint, we see tremendous opportunity around the marketplace overall. And as there's been some market strategy, it creates more opportunity. As Christa described, our decisions are made around literally with the cash pool. It's a return on those capital, cash-on-cash return and we see lots of opportunity out there. We also see lots of opportunity to invest organically in our business and we've been doing that with great success. And the pipeline we see is as strong as ever before as Christa described, it's got to really add value. For us, it's about content, we can scale effectively. And that really drives sort of a set of outcomes that are very powerful. And we see a lot of opportunities there. Christa, anything else you'd add to that?
Christa Davies: Yes. And look, I would just add, we've found some terrific companies and invested in those this year. I mean, Tyche, fantastic capability in the capital modeling and analytics space and ERM in the modeling space in Mexico. And so we continue to invest in areas of high growth and client need which we're really excited about.
Operator: Our final question this morning comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
Mike Zaremski: Great. Just a follow-up on the M&A landscape. Can you remind us -- we know that Aon has moved in some of M&A with cover wallet into the small commercial marketplace. Any ambitions to get into kind of the main street U.S. retail marketplace. I know you just mentioned there were some market stresses. I believe there's some market stresses for some of the private equity roll-ups there. Just curious if that's any ambitions to get into kind of Main Street retail, small mid-commercial?
Greg Case: Listen, as we step back, I want to make sure I understand the market segments that you're thinking about them. We love the segments we operate in which is really the large market, the middle sized marketplace and the small commercial market. And you're absolutely right. The bringing in cover wallet has been phenomenal. It is a capability, much like many that we can scale. Scale, not just in the small commercial market but if you think about B2B, 2C in large companies with bringing that capability in the context of that, if you think about kind of distributed businesses, franchises, things like that phenomenal kind of opportunities. So we love the space. We've got great capability in it. We were going to continue to grow it and we've seen great success with it. So that's how we think about overall small commercial. But I want to make sure does that answer your question.
Mike Zaremski: Yes. I just wanted to confirm that you -- there is no strategic initiative that kind of operates more kind of in the here I guess, for a marshaling agency or what were the sandbox that they're competing in. The smaller size businesses versus the kind of Fortune 5000, little bigger cover wallet.
Greg Case: Yes, we're absolutely active across the board. The question is how and how with content capability that lets us scale in those agreements. And we've been very successful across all of those segment pieces, not necessarily in Novo [ph] because of that size as opposed to more capability. But it really has been -- we love the segments, I see great opportunity in the segments and cover while it was a great addition to the Aon world. Eric, anything else you'd add to that?
Eric Andersen: Yes, Greg. I would say in our Affinity businesses, we serve specialized groups of small. So we're very active in the small space but really where we can bring distinct value, whether it's in the travel space or museums, that type of thing, where we actually have a product or capability where we're able to provide distinct value to the clients. I would also say with our office -- our 500 offices around the world, we engage with clients across all segments. I mean, there are only 500 Fortune 500 clients. We do an awful lot in the middle market and the small commercial. Our strategy is to bring product solutions using the expertise that we have across all of our capabilities and package them and deliver them in a way where we're providing the real value of using Aon as your adviser, so you get that product expertise but delivered in a way where it's efficient and cost effective for them to be able to use our capabilities.
Mike Zaremski: Okay. That's interesting and helpful. And my last follow-up was on fiduciary investment income. And I know there's some nuances and that make it not -- it's tough for us to model exactly but should we be expecting a quarterly step up, a material step-up into '23 based on where the interest rates are now across the globe?
Christa Davies: Yes. So what I would tell you is what we saw in 2022 was that interest rate stepped up in Q3 and Q4 of 2022. And so if interest rates stay where they are today, you'll see a similar impact to Q4 in Q1 and Q2. And so we would expect that increase in interest rates stay where they are. And then for modeling going forward, every 100 basis point increase in interest rates is approximately $65 million in fiduciary investment income. And there's no delay between interest rate increases and it impacting our fiduciary investment income.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Case for any final comments.
Greg Case: I just want to say thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate it and look forward to the next call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-28 10:11:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to the Aon plc's Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2022 results as well as having been posted on our Web site. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our Web site. We begin by thanking our Aon colleagues for delivering another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth. Our recently concluded all colleague engagement survey reinforces the resilience and commitment of our team as we continue to receive and benefit from exceptional colleague feedback with overall engagement, ways of working and brand strength all at 80% or greater.  More than ever, colleagues understand the power of our Aon United strategy and have embraced the smart work and approach we developed to preserve flexibility in how and where we work, while enabling them to be better connected and more capable of helping clients make better decisions to support their businesses.  The importance of this support and the exceptional nature of our response is illustrated by our recently released executive survey and the tremendous leadership of our team on Hurricane Ian. Taken together, these two data points reinforce the relevance and return on our Aon United strategy.  First, our 2022 Executive Risk survey, which surveyed 800 C-suite executives from global companies underscores the volatility facing leading organizations and offers a window into their mindset and needs. A majority surveyed 79% increased volatility on the horizon, but only a third, just 35% feel fully prepared to manage the impact of that volatility.  Most important, those that feel very prepared share three fundamental leadership attributes that reinforce their relevance of our capabilities. First, they see embracing risk as a source of potential competitive advantage. 62% of very prepared leaders agree that their company's appetite for risk has increased in response to the current economic conditions.  Second, they're willing to invest in new approaches to address emerging risks. These leaders focus on long tail risks and call out concerns around disruptive categories, like cyber and supply chain. And third, they value expert insight and are looking for partners to help them make better business decisions. Prepared leaders are nearly twice as likely to look to counsel from an external advisor that can provide a more holistic enterprise perspective on decisions to protect and grow their businesses. Now these survey findings reinforce the relevance of our strategy, Hurricane Ian highlights an excellent example of that value in action. To begin, we want to extend our deepest sympathies to those impacted by this event. In these times of challenges, communities endure the tragic loss of life and tremendous damage, we believe that our actions as a firm can help businesses and communities respond and recover.  As always, our team took a holistic and united view toward serving our clients before, during and after the event. Pre-event, we used our resource development models to ensure that our 1,800 promotional risk clients, colleagues around the world were prepared to respond to a surge in client needs. This was a collaborative global effort possible only because of our mindset and single P&L approach.  In addition, we are able to use impact forecasting models from our reinsurance team to game out potential hurricane paths and share those insights with our commercial risk colleagues so they can alert clients to potential exposures, allowing for early activation of business continuity plans. During the event, we provided real-time insight on actual harm by leveraging satellite and drone imagery provided through technology partnerships enabled by our Aon Business Services team. This is another example of how our emphasis on technology-driven innovation is reshaping client service at scale.  Post-event, we obviously focused on accelerating clients' resolution but we're also stepping back with clients and taking an enterprise view of what the hurricane means for their benefit plans, leveraging our Health Solutions team and beginning new conversations around how they think about return to work, exploring how our Human Capital Solutions colleagues can apply learnings from our own smart working strategy to their workforce management.  This is Aon United in action, and only possible because of the decade plus investment we've made to break down barriers across our business and build Aon Business Services into an engine that provides us the insight and skill necessary to meet client needs.  Turning to performance. In the third quarter, our colleagues delivered excellent results demonstrating continued momentum and year-to-date progress against our key financial metrics. For Q3, organic revenue growth was 5% on top of 12% in the prior year quarter, adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 16%.  These results are consistent with our full year ongoing financial guidance, and we would note that Q3 is our seasonally smallest quarter for revenue. Year-to-date, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points, adjusted EPS growth of 14% and generated over 2 billion in free cash flow.  Turning to solution lines. Commercial risk delivered 5% organic revenue growth this quarter on top of 13% in the prior year quarter, contributed 7% organic revenue growth year-to-date, driven by ongoing strong retention, new business generation and renewal highlighting the resilience of our core business as we continue to help clients protect and grow their businesses.  As we previously mentioned, the significant decrease in M&A volume impacted our transaction solutions business, especially compared to last year's results, which was particularly strong in Q3 and Q4. Reinsurance delivered 7% organic revenue growth in the quarter, with 7% year-to-date, as our team continues to help clients in the current market by bringing new solutions and capabilities.  For instance, our newly established Strategy and Technology Group provides our clients with strategic advice, data-driven consulting, analytics and modeling tools and is further strengthened by the capability we've gained through our acquisition of Tyche. This is all in the time in driving growth, efficiency and resilience, have never been more important.  Health Solutions delivered 5% organic revenue growth in Q3 on top of 16% in the prior year quarter, contributed to 8% year-to-date growth, but particularly strong growth in Human Capital Solutions. Across health, we see clients assessing their people strategies to optimize for workforce scale and organizational structure while making sure those employees feel valued and engaged. Finally, Wealth Solutions delivered 2% organic growth on top of 4% in Q3 last year and 2% year-to-date as our team continues to help clients address market volatility, talk of regulatory challenges and execute ongoing pension risk transfers. In two exciting milestones, our team has advised over 200 billion potential risk transfer transactions in the U.S. and UK as pension plans continue to derisk and take advantage of market conditions.  And we reached the 1 billion mark in client assets and commitments for our pooled employer plan, which helps cover and helps lower costs, enhance retirement security for employees at smaller organizations. Overall, our strong performance in Q3 and year-to-date reflects the strength of our Aon United strategy and Aon Business Services platform delivered for clients across regions and solutions lines. For the full year, we remain confident in our commitment to mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin improvement, and double digit free cash flow growth. As our clients assess the impact of increased economic volatility on their businesses, many are looking to improve their own working capital and liquidity, often by accessing new sources of capital.  In one recent example, an Aon United example, our client based in Asia was awarded a multi-billion dollar construction contract in Latin America for a manufacturing facility that incorporates innovative carbon reduction technologies. The client had a regulatory and contractual requirement that they provide a financial performance guarantee, essentially drawing on their own credit facility.  To address our local commercial risk team who has deep understanding of our client strategy and financial position collaborated closely with our local credit experts in LatAm to design a bespoke surety bond solution for our client. Rather than using a bank guarantee facility, our client was able to access capital at a lower cost and more attractive terms while maintaining their own balance sheet strength and flexibility.  Just as we've done with intellectual property lending and pitching those transfer solutions, this is another example of how we help clients access new capital to reduce risk and drive their own growth objectives.  In summary, we delivered a strong quarter, top and bottom line results, contributed to our year-to-date progress against key metrics. We continue to be stronger positioned to deliver on our full year financial commitments of mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin expansion and double digit free cash flow growth.  We see increasing opportunity to help our clients and the steps we've taken to operationalize Aon United and our Aon Business Services platform gives us confidence in our ability to address our clients' existing and emerging needs as they continue to protect and grow their businesses.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our performance in the quarter and year-to-date, as well as our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered continued progress on our key financial metrics, both the quarter and year-to-date. For the first nine months of the year, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 80 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share, and generated over 2 billion in free cash flow. We look forward to building on this momentum as we head into the last quarter of 2022.  As I reflect on our performance year-to-date, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 5% in the third quarter and 7% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2022 and over the long term. I would also note that flat [ph] reported revenue growth in Q3 and 3% year-to-date includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX of 5% for Q3 and 4% year-to-date, primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies. And I’d highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in our organic revenue growth calculation, was $26 million in Q3 and $35 million year-to-date.  Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement through the first nine months of the year, with adjusted operating margins of 30%, an increase of 80 basis points driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investment in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth and some ongoing resumption of T&E.  Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2022 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. As we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of a full year. And we expect continued investment in colleagues and ongoing resumption of T&A as well as ongoing investments in long-term growth like technology throughout the year. Aon Business Services is a key contributor to margin expansion and represents a competitive advantage, especially in a highly inflationary market. Our Aon Business Services platform continues to drive efficiency gains, improved quality and service and increased innovation at scale.  Let me share one fantastic example of how Aon Business Services platform supports ongoing improvement, as we automate day-to-day processes around the firm. Reinsurance has operated on a single global broking platform and client service model since 2017.  Over the past five years, the team has digitized processes, automated workflows and moved work to low cost locations. 64% of transactions are now processed digitally, increasing speed and accuracy, which has helped reduce the average number of days it takes to get claims from carriers paid to our clients by 22% from 38 to 30 days.  Increase in capacity enabled 27% more throughput, while costs are up just 9% over five years, a particularly impressive outcome when considering recent costs and wage inflation trends. And the platform enables the team to provide enhanced services while dealing with more complex transactions, an Aon United outcome that allows our colleagues to better support each other and our clients.  We continue to find and capture efficiency opportunities like this around the firm and expect Aon Business Services will continue to be a driver of ongoing efficiency improvements, quality and service improvements and increased innovation for clients.  We translated strong operating income growth into double digit adjusted EPS growth of 16% in Q3 and 14% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.05 per share in Q3 and $0.34 per share year-to-date. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an unfavorable impact or approximately $0.11 per share or approximately $33 million decrease in operating income in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Turning to free cash flow and capital allocation. Free cash flow increased 79% year-to-date to 2,051 million, reflecting an increase in cash flow from operations due primarily to the $1 billion termination fee payment in the prior year period. As we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and I’d note Q4 is our seasonally strongest for free cash flow generation. We continue to expect to deliver double digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvements. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond, we expect share repurchases to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation.  We believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the approximately 1.2 billion of share repurchases in the quarter and 2.5 billion year-to-date. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. We've invested in expertise and content in our retirement business, where we're helping clients navigate regulatory changes such as GMP in the UK, and utilizing higher interest rates to drive record levels of pension risk transfers.  Our M&A pipeline continuously focused on our priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on a return on capital balance basis.  Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. We issued 500 million of 10-year senior notes in Q3. And as we've said before, we'll continue to add debt as EBITDA grows while maintaining our current investment grade credit ratings.  With respect to interest rates, I'd note that our term debt is all fixed rates, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.8% and a weighted average maturity approximately 12 years. I'd also note that our pension liability improves as interest rates increase, and historically we've taken steps to derisk this liability and reduce volatility.  In summary, our strong financial results in the quarter and year-to-date demonstrate continued momentum and progress against our key financial metrics. While we're seeing signs of economic uncertainty, we remain confident in the strength of our firm and our financial guidance for '22. Overall, our business is resilient and our Aon United strategy gives us confidence in our ability to deliver results in any economic scenario. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to the operator and we’d be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. So first, I just had a question on the commercial risk business. Your organic growth slowed sequentially. Obviously, comps were more difficult as well. But you mentioned that Asia, Latin America and UK grew at a pretty strong pace and there was a slowdown in U.S. retail business because of lower transaction volumes. Can you sort of elaborate on that and what you're seeing in the U.S. business?
Greg Case: Yes, Jimmy, thanks for the question. Listen, as we highlighted again on commercial specifically, but it really plays out for the firm overall, 7% organic year-to-date, 11%, year-to-date last year, and then 13% in the quarter as you highlight and really gets strong across the board, across all geographies and real strength in core P&C and Affinity, and we really want to highlight that. The only thing we highlighted that was a little different was obviously the M&A transaction levels last year were extraordinary. And our capability there is just exceptional. And Eric, maybe can talk a little bit about that. And that's really what’s not going to repeat this year, but overall very, very strong momentum as we finish the year this year and move into next year. But Eric, any thoughts on that? 
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg, and a great question. I would say, from an overall perspective, commercial risk in the U.S. had very solid new business numbers, very solid retention and rollover numbers, Greg, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks. And I would just say, look, on transaction services, we are serving the private equity industry and the corporate industry as they make acquisitions and divestitures. And so we -- during a period like this where it's a little bit slower, we are spending time with the markets, with the reinsurance markets, with the clients building out our strategy for when it ultimately comes back and feel like the team that we have today is fantastic. But they're also working very hard with their clients, making sure we've got the next generation or product ready when the economic environment changes.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And I think you mentioned modestly positive benefit from pricing the last few quarters and this quarter as well. And if we think about the reinsurance business, there's obviously a lot of dislocation there. Can you talk about how do you expect that to affect your results? And should there be a greater tailwind from pricing, at least on the reinsurance side?
Greg Case: Maybe I'll start with the overall, and then Eric just pick up on the reinsurance front, in particular. Overall, as you highlighted, we look at market impact. That's how we think about it. Obviously, it includes insured values and price. We highlight modest impacts in the quarter and expect for the year. Over time, you can expect insured value will begin to creep up. That will actually have a sustained lasting impact over time. And we'll see how the pricing piece changes out. But overall market impact kind of modest as we think about the impact here. The reinsurance dynamic is important and is evolving. Eric, you want to pick up on that?
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg. And maybe just one comment on the just general pricing environment on the primary side. I think you laid it out, right. But also I think we've talked about this before. We spend a lot of time with our clients using data and analytics to kind of understand the choices they need to make. So while inflation and while pricing may be moving against them from this perspective, they don't sit still. They're looking at whether it's captive utilization, whether it's retentions, deductibles, limit, all those tools, and we try and help them think through what's best for them, as they're navigating their sort of economic changes that they're facing in their business. So while the market is, as you said, Greg, there is effect of inflation and pricing, we're certainly working with them -- the client as they make those decisions. Certainly on the reinsurance, I think it's worth just stepping back. There is a lot going on right now on the reinsurance side. And our primary mission continues to be to help our insurance company clients match risk with capital. And remember, this is a global business like view in terms of where the capital is sourced from and how it’s deployed. And it shows up very differently in different parts of the world. And I think as we move away from Hurricane Ian, we start to get a little more clarity around what the ultimate losses look like and who's holding those losses. But if you step back and you think about it geographically, the European clients I think are expecting to have the supply of property cat that they need, albeit with the pricing and structure negotiation. That takes into account the effects of inflation that's happening in Europe, but also the losses that have happened in that region over the last three years, whether it's German floods, French hail, et cetera. They've got certain dynamics that have affected the European marketplace. And I think for North America, the property cat market is going to be more challenging. Managing the effects of inflation, supply challenges, some remaining uncertainty around Ian will create difficulties. But ultimately, we're focused on creating capital for them, capital options, so they can get the protection that they need going forward. I would also say, it also has an effect on facultative reinsurance and other tools that we have, because as those insurers are forced to take higher retentions, they certainly are going to continue to look to derisk. They just do it with different tools, right? They actually then will look at specific clients that they've got on their primary portfolio that they want help on, they'll use facultative instead of treaty [ph]. So while the market does shift, there are levers out there that we bring to bear for our clients that can actually help them derisk and get the protection that they need. 
Greg Case: And last thing I just want to highlight on this, Jimmy, before we leave this point, this is tremendous for us. This is where we live. There is more activity going on with a ton of capabilities that are unique in the world today. What our colleagues have built on the reinsurance side is extraordinary, and we've just added to it with data and analytics and all that we've done with our strategy and technology effort now added with psyche that I mentioned before. So Eric described the market perfectly, but boy, this is our wheelhouse. We love it. It creates tremendous opportunity to support clients, and we're bringing all the solutions to bear. And in many respects, helping our clients manage challenging times. And for us, it's a great opportunity for the next 12 to 24 months.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the margin side. So in the quarter, you guys saw 100 basis points of margin improvement. If I assume that all the fiduciary investment income fell to the bottom line, that could give you a tailwind of 90 basis points. I'm just trying to get a sense of that 100. Can you give us a sense of the split between how much in the margin improvement came from the pickup in fiduciary investment income versus core margin improvement in operating leverage?
Christa Davies: Sure. Thanks for the question, Elyse. And look, what we would say as we think about this in terms of year-to-date, and year-to-date, we had a $35 million benefit from investment income. So it's about a 20 basis point impact on full year margins. And so it's not nearly as big as the numbers you highlighted, Elyse. And so for us, as we think about growing margin expansion for the full year, which we are completely committed to doing, it's really about continuing to drive organic revenue growth, the portfolio mix in higher revenue growth, higher margin areas, and the productivity benefits we're getting from Aon Business Services. And so we're fully on track to deliver full year margin expansion.
Elyse Greenspan: As we think about rates continuing to rise, right, so that fiduciary investment income should go higher from here. So we're not just thinking Q4, but '23 as well. Do you guys think most of the benefits will fall to the bottom line, or how do you balance letting it fall versus looking to take some extra dollars to invest internally?
Christa Davies: Yes. So first of all, Elyse, what I would say is we manage 6 billion of fiduciary investment income, and every 100 basis points of increase is 60 million top line and bottom line. But, Elyse, we're doing a lot of work for clients to actually manage that. We're actually doing all the insurance accounting and transaction processing in the middle on paying premiums on the way in and then paying claims on the way out. Just one correction, Elyse. The impact of fiduciary investment income in the quarter is 70 basis points, not 90.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then my last question was going back to the comments on transactions within commercial risk. I know you guys highlighted lower transaction volume. Was the third quarter of last year heavier for that business or will we also potentially see that impact the growth there in the fourth quarter as well?
Greg Case: Yes, Elyse, if we take a step back, again, I just emphasize really look at the quarter overall for us sort of year-to-date, it seems to have been a tremendous job year-to-date, 7% overall, over 9% last year, really strength across the board. The M&A activity that we described and talked about was really Q3 and Q4, both levels of activity exceptionally strong. But it didn't -- hasn't changed in any way, shape, or form, as Christa described, exactly where we are now as we think about mid-single digit or greater for the year, margin expansion and double digit free cash flow growth. And I just would highlight Eric's points around the strength of our team, it's really extraordinary and what they've been able to do and how that's evolved over time. So they're exceptionally well positioned as the market comes back.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Zaremski: Hi. Good morning. Happy Friday. Maybe thinking about free cash flow, last year, as you guys helped us out with, there's clearly a bit of noise this year. Are there any items that you feel you want to call out maybe on the working capital improvement side? You mentioned, Christa, that 4Q is usually a pretty strong quarter. So I'm looking at free cash flow this year as a percentage of revenues, for example. It's a very healthy level. I just want to make sure I'm not missing something.
Christa Davies: Mike, I don't think you're missing anything. So free cash flow 2,051 million year-to-date, up 79%. Nothing particularly unusual. We did mention in Q1 and Q2 that we had lower levels of free cash flow because of higher incentive comp based on extraordinary performance in 2021. That's the only thing I would note. And then I would say, in general, we're going to continue to drive free cash flow growth double digits based on continued acceleration in revenue growth, margin expansion, and then working capital improvements. You did see, if you look at the external receivables divided by revenue on the balance sheet, that DSO improved by two days from Q3 '21 to Q3 '22. It went from 91 days down to 89 days. And so we're very pleased with our continued progress in working capital.
Michael Zaremski: And if you stated as the goal to get down low below 89 over time, or is that the main lever for the working capital over the next few years?
Christa Davies: Yes. So what we have said, Mike, is that we have essentially 500 million of excess receivables sitting on our balance sheet. And that over time, we will continue to improve DSO to get that 500 million to zero. And so that is a big upside in free cash flow growth over the coming years.
Michael Zaremski: Okay, great. That’s helpful. And maybe switching gears, curious if cyber insurance, you guys are one of the leaders in the marketplace. Clearly, rates are up a lot but clients are still, we're seeing still buying just as much or more. Maybe you can comment on the cyber market. But I’d also be curious to hear about whether the intellectual property market, which I think you guys are one of the pioneers of, is gaining any traction? Thank you.
Eric Andersen: Sure. This is Eric. Maybe I'll take a shot at it. So on the cyber market we continue to see great growth in the business. And I would say what has changed if anything over the last several months is really the renewed focus on quality underwriting. And so if you remember at the very beginning of that product, it was all about risk management, risk identification, risk management, and then risk transfer. I think what happened to the market is they went immediately to risk transfer without enough focus on the quality of the risk mitigation and the risk management. As the market has reacted due to losses, they essentially went back to basics. And I think ultimately the market will be healthier for it. So we continue to see great growth. We invest globally in our capability there and really like our position and the work that we're doing for clients. I would say in intellectual property, very similar. I couldn't be more excited about where we are with that. Continue to see great deal flow, getting markets to join the product. We actually did our first IP reinsurance treaty this quarter. Certainly not big dollars, but a real symbol on how we're bringing a broader market to bear on supporting that product as it develops. So really excited about both of them and think we've got a great lead in the market with our capability. And we're going to continue to invest and push to develop those markets in a broader way. 
Greg Case: And Mike, I can help with -- I’d just to call out the IP progression has been extraordinary. If you go back four years ago, we bring in 25, 30 colleagues in to sort of think about this. We’re 200 strong now in this category. No one had ever actually valued an IP stack in such that a prime [ph] stack such that it can actually be insured against a loan borrower. Now we've done 15 plus deals. I think we talked about last quarter we've crossed $1 billion in lending on this front. And as Eric said, now we have multiple markets involved and even reinsurance involved. So this is a progression. It's still very, very early days. But the team's done a tremendous job sort of building out this opportunity.
Michael Zaremski: Thank you. Best of luck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
David Motemaden: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on the Wealth Business. Just on the AUM, the AUM base delegated investment management that was cited as a headwind. Could you give us an idea of how much the AUM base was down and how we should think about that going forward as markets remain under pressure?
Christa Davies: It was down, David. We didn't give the impact of it. But you're absolutely right. The way in which we earn fees in that delegated businesses is percentage on AUM. And so it really depends on how the markets go as to how we see that progressing going forward. But I would say offsetting that decline on the investment management side was fantastic growth on the retirement side, as Greg and I talked about on our prepared remarks. We've got enormous growth dealing with regulatory change, particularly GMP in the UK, fantastic work going on there by the team. And then as global interest rates rise, it's one of the best environments to do pension risk transfers that have happened in the last 15 years. And we are the global leader in this. We're very, very excited about our position in that space. And then, as we mentioned on the call, our PEP product in the U.S. is doing exceptionally well. And so there are so many areas on the retirement side where we have great opportunities for growth. But Eric, what else would you add here?
Eric Andersen: No, because I think you've covered all of it. We're just really excited about watching the retirement business in particular, really add great value to our clients. The UK, certainly some great activity going on there and the U.S. as well. But that PEP product, which is the pooled employer plan, really is a great expense solution for our smaller clients as they look to manage the retirement assets. So you've covered it well, and really a solid quarter for them.
David Motemaden: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just going back to commercial risk, I guess I was just wondering if you could talk about, I guess maybe just say what the growth was if we were to just exclude that U.S. retail -- that retail’s comp that was a bit tougher? And how that compared versus last quarter? Did we see any slowdown there sequentially, or was it really just all driven by the U.S. retail’s tougher comp?
Greg Case: David, as we described, listen, if we would step back, really tremendous progress across the board. And if you think about sort of what's happening on the commercial restaurant we highlighted, but really it's an opportunity where we see over time that’s going to be tremendous on the transaction solution side. But overall, really strong across the board and just continues to build momentum as we described before.
David Motemaden: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. Two quick questions, if I can. First, Eric, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about capacity shortfalls in the U.S. in the context of the impact of rising interest rates on capital? And how much more work does that actually entail for the reinsurance unit?
Eric Andersen: So if you think about -- I'm assuming you're talking about property cat at this point [indiscernible] basis on the reinsurance which people don't tend to talk about, but is a substantial part of the industry. They're continuing to battle their own inflation understanding as they price long tail products. I do think that market is much -- while it's challenged, it is more around pricing structure, not about supply. So listen, I think as property cat in the U.S. continues to be challenged for a couple of reasons. One, you've got significant losses both on the traditional things like hurricane, but also as you think about wildfire or storms, the secondary perils have been a substantial hit to reinsurers over the last five years. So there is certainly a crisis of confidence in underwriting and how they deploy their capital for our clients. And so models have to be better. We really have to focus hard on making sure risk identification. They understand exactly what they're offering and what the sort of return scenarios are for them over time. The effects of interest rates really affect the ILS market, which has two -- I would say two headwinds right now. One is there's some trapped capital with Ian as people are trying to figure out exactly where the losses are, what the damage is. And there's also the relative investment question of as interest rates go up, their ability to find other assets that don't risk their capital is something that essentially just creates a repricing I think at the ILS market, which is happening. And so for us, I think it doesn't necessarily create work. It creates understanding of the market dynamics and the returns. But we're in the middle of that right now as we lead up to the big 1/1 renewal season and then again in April and July. 
Greg Case: And, Meyer, I know you've got another question and I'll come to that. But this really does, as Eric described, reinforces the opportunity. When you can pick apart the market the way Eric has described and have the analytics to really do something about it, drive solutions on behalf of clients, this is what puts us in such a unique position against the rest of the world on this topic. So again, a lot going on out there and we love it every day, because it puts us in a very, very unique position.
Meyer Shields: No, that's very helpful. I understand that. Thanks. And then I guess a question for Christa maybe. So you talked about how there's more pension risk transfer going on. You also mentioned how higher interest rates benefit Aon’s pension funding. And I'm wondering, I understand that there's more willingness to take pension liabilities from people in a higher interest rate environment, but wouldn't there be less demand for transfer if interest rates are higher?
Christa Davies: So there's always been capacity. The real challenge, Meyer, is the economics haven't made it make sense to actually be able to buy out, because you haven't been able to execute the transfers without being able to add the cash given to get to fully funded. And so the increase in interest rates is getting plans fully funded, which means that they can actually do this transfer. So the capacity has always been there. It's more that the pension plans haven't been funded enough to be able to make this work. And I would say we're seeing more demand from this for buy-ins and buyouts from clients than we have in the last 10 plus years. And we have done substantial numbers of pension with transfers in the U.S. and the UK. And I'm very, very well positioned to do it. So it's a very exciting growth area for us.
Meyer Shields: Okay, phenomenal. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Shanker: Yes. Thank you for getting me in at the end here. You spoke in the prepared remarks about higher expenses from T&E resumption, both as a consultant and protector of the risk of your clients as well as internally. Can you talk about the shape that's happening? Where we are relative to where we were two and a half years ago? And if we go into recession, whether we're topping out here on T&E and whatnot?
Christa Davies: Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. So I would say T&E is obviously up from 2020 and 2021 levels. It's not that 2019 levels, really because we're actually very thoughtful about how we do the work. And we've implemented smart working, which I know Greg talked about in relation to our engagement survey. It's one of the things that's driving employee engagement to the highest levels in our history, because we're very thoughtful about where is the best place, and there are a number of areas, and Eric you might want to talk about them, where we're doing work in different ways and it has a higher impact on clients. Eric?
Eric Andersen: Yes, Christa, I think that's great. And I think it drives productivity of our colleagues, it drives engagement, as you said, really being able to use the technology that we've been investing in through our Aon Business Services model over a number of years. And just there's something that happened a week or two ago, just came to mind, as you were talking, Christa. We do these insight series across the world with our clients. And normally, historically, we would have flown everybody in from around the world. And this one happened to be in Australia. So it would have been a week of time for the team basically off the grid as they went to present an hour slot for whatever topic they were asking for. And so on this one in particular, we had our climate team, which is based in London that's been working on building the climate strategy for us. Essentially WebEx into the insight series meeting did the question-and-answer, actually gave a great presentation. And then when they were finished, they were home. And they were back on to the next topic and continuing to work. So we were able to bring that capability without the big expense of travel and entertainment. We were able to deliver the capability and we gained the hours that we would have lost to the flights and the jetlag and everything else that we all know about in a way that drives more productivity. So that's just one example. There are many of them that follow the similar path. We just did a big renewal meeting, for example, for a big U.S. client where we used the immersion room in our New York office and brought in the European insurers and reinsurers and the London European insurers and reinsurers and essentially did what would have been a three-week trip, turned it into a five-hour session in one location. And so again, saves time, saves money. But more importantly, the clients are finding value in it. They actually feel like they're getting that connection with the markets that they want. And our colleagues -- it absolutely allows us to show off our global colleagues in a way that you don't really get to do when you're traveling place to place and so focused on schedule. So we're really excited about it. And as Christa said, it's driving engagement and more importantly productivity. And I think the clients are really enjoying the time they get back as well.
Joshua Shanker: And just can you add -- and this is obviously in Aon’s experience, is this similar to what your understanding is going on with your clients or is your clients cost rising faster than your crack team of spend managers can manage for the company itself?
Eric Andersen: So I would say our Human Capital Business spends a lot of time working with our clients on how to do smart working. And so I think as we come -- the pandemic is further and further in the rearview mirror, people are finding their new normal and our teams are doing I think a great job helping them structure and engage with our clients in a way that they're able to do the same thing, because our clients are also looking to get productivity. They're also looking to manage D&E [ph]. And they want to leverage the technology that we all use so much during the pandemic in ways that actually create the outcomes that they're looking for. 
Greg Case: And really, Josh, if you think about it, the whole phenomena you're highlighting, it ends up being incredibly substantial and significant for us, but even more so for our clients. And Eric described it well, but just combines the whole wellness issues and challenges, it really connects with our health group [indiscernible] that it hasn't before. It's a very integrated response, cutting across multiple solution lines. It's the best example -- another example of Aon United in action, as we help clients try to understand how they can really address the work environment, smart working as we describe it, but even more broadly, how it impacts their own engagement and how they drive talent acquisition, talent retention, talent enrichment. And it's a real opportunity for us. And it really -- the beauty of it is it connects across multiple solution lines, which is perfect Aon United from our standpoint.
Joshua Shanker: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Case for any final comments.
Greg Case: Just want to say thanks to everybody for joining us. We appreciate it and look forward to talking next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-29 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2022 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
Gregory Case: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We begin by expressing our deepest appreciation for our colleagues. Their extraordinary dedication to delivering results for clients, bringing the best of Aon across geographies and solution lines, is inspiring. And their passion and commitment are reflected in the highest-ever colleague engagement recorded in our latest full survey. In the second quarter, our colleagues delivered excellent results, demonstrating continued momentum and progress against our key financial metrics. Organic revenue growth was 8% in Q2 and year-to-date, on top of 11% in prior year quarter, consistent with our ongoing financial guidance of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth. This top line strength translated into an adjusted operating margin of 26.2% in the quarter, up 40 basis points from last year, and adjusted EPS growth of 15%, demonstrating the strength of our Aon United strategy and Aon Business Services platform. Turning to revenue. Commercial Risk delivered 7% organic revenue growth, driven by ongoing strong retention and renewals, highlighting the strength of our core business and strength from areas of investment like CoverWallet within digital client solutions. In addition, external trends, select inflation continue to be an opportunity for us to help ensure clients are covered for increased exposure. Reinsurance delivered 9% organic revenue growth in a dynamic renewal market. Our team brought the full capability of our firm's data, analytics and expertise, resulting in strong retention and net new business generation. Health Solutions delivered 11% organic revenue growth, with strong growth in core health and benefits driven by client demand, increasing health care costs and continued growth in advisory work related to regulatory changes, well-being and resilience. Within Human Capital Solutions, demand remains very high to support clients with advice and solutions, especially as they manage ongoing return-to-work plans, a highly competitive talent market, wage inflation and employee well-being. Finally, Wealth Solutions delivered 3% organic growth as our teams continued to deliver results in core retirement and investment solutions, with ongoing additional work to help clients address regulatory changes and impact from recent market conditions, like the opportunity for pension risk transfer. Across Wealth and Health, external factors are increasing client costs, making it more important than ever for them to efficiently provide optimal benefits for their employees. Overall, our strong performance in Q2 and year-to-date reflects the strength of our core business across regions and solution lines. While there is uncertainty around external economic factors, some of the trends that challenge the broader economy are positive for our business and create opportunities to health plans. For the full year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver results in each of our 3 financial commitments; Mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth. On the topic of innovation, among many categories of investment, we'd like to highlight 2 areas where clients are demanding new or better solutions, and we are making meaningful progress in serving them. Intellectual property and climate. On IP, our Intellectual Property Solutions team is delivering a first-of-its-kind solution that enables entrepreneurs to fund IP-rich start-up growth businesses without giving up ownership using debt that is backed by insured IP assets. Q2 marked an exciting milestone as the team crossed the $1 billion threshold in IP-backed insurance and Aon's debt financing. Let me highlight one recent opportunity where our team supported a high-growth technology hardware company. Given the company's business model and growth stage, we've had multiple funding avenues available. The company chose this solution to meet its growth capital needs, minimizing equity dilution. The $100 million transaction allowed the company to secure its financing for growth, while insurance markets were able to derisk high-risk schools with an innovative application to an intangible asset class. Going forward, we're making progress to increase the number of lenders and insurance carriers participating in that solution as we build client awareness, accelerate distribution and continue to scale this business. One additional note, as current and evolving economic conditions make impressive equity-driven valuations, IP-backed debt provides a potential new option for start-up growth clients to protect equity ownership and forgo potential down-round funding. On climate, our team is working on many initiatives. Today, we will highlight 2. Aon's work on Aon and our work supporting renewable energy investment. We'll start with our progress on Aon's journey to Zero Carbon. In March of 2021, we made an industry-leading commitment to be net zero by 2030, in alignment with science-based targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. We're pleased to report that we've made great progress so far and reduced our 2021 carbon emissions 12% from our 2019 baseline, as we decarbonized our supply chain, reduced our real estate footprint with smaller greener space and reduced travel, in part with the impact of COVID-19. Our recent ESG impact report details our commitment and actions on climate as well as our ESG topics, which are embedded in our overall strategy. For our clients, this comes down to helping them understand and quantify their climate risk. We prepare to communicate and report on this risk and do something about it by building resiliency, positioning lower carbon and investing in transition. Given our track record of underwriting new risks and developing proprietary valuation models, paired with our climate analytics, data and partnerships, we're very well positioned to our clients' quantify current and potential future risks, which we can then help them mitigate and transfer. For example, in renewable energy alone, onshore and offshore wind investment exceeds $70 billion today and could grow to nearly $400 billion by 2030, another rapidly growing addressable market that we serve with meaningful solutions today to ensure the construction and ongoing operation of these facilities. Similarly, in solar, there is $45 billion of investment today in construction, manufacturing and technology development. And we expect this investment to grow to over $100 billion by 2025. Recently, our team facilitated a placement for one of the world's largest solar farms, required in Aon United Equity across Commercial Risk and Reinsurance to obtain coverage despite challenging market conditions. As these renewable energy projects continue to grow in size, scale and complexity, the need for expertise and innovation in existing technologies will only increase. Further innovation in areas like carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and other new technologies will require even more innovation to enable the risk financing necessary to make these projects more economically attractive. Our ability to reduce risks of new solutions helps bring in new investment and ultimately helps enable continued moves toward decarbonization. In summary, we delivered a strong quarter, demonstrating continued operating momentum and progress in our key financial metrics. Our Aon United strategy and operating model, supported by Aon Business Services, places us in a very strong position to support our clients as they face changing economic conditions. In addition, our colleague engagement is very high as our team delivers on a strategy that enables us to achieve results today, both in the core and in priority growth areas, while also investing in innovative new client solutions like intellectual property and climate. Finally, our strong performance in Q2 and year-to-date reinforces our commitment to achieving our financial objectives for the year. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our performance and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered continued progress in both the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first half of the year, we translated 8% organic revenue growth into 50 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. We look forward to building on this momentum through the rest of 2022, as I reflect on our performance through the first half of the year. As Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 8% in both Q2 and year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth for full year 2022 and over the long term. I would also note that reported revenue growth of 3% in Q2 and 4% year-to-date includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX, primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies and fiduciary investment income of $7 million in Q2 and $9 million year-to-date. Further, I note we are uniquely well positioned with respect to current economic conditions. Inflation increases insured values, which has a positive impact on our business, and we've continued to see modest tailwinds from insurance pricing, which remains strong. Interest rate increases benefit costs through fiduciary investment income and reduced pension liabilities. Broadly, as Greg mentioned, volatility makes the solutions and advice we offer around risk and people even more valuable to our clients, for instance, in areas like workforce resilience and pension derisking. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement through the first half of the year, with adjusted operating margins of 32.7%, an increase of 50 basis points, driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from our Aon Business Services platform; overcoming expense growth, which includes investment in colleagues, technology to drive long-term growth and some ongoing resumption of T&E. Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2022 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. As we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of the full year. And we expect continued investment in colleagues and ongoing reduction of T&E throughout the year. Our Aon Business Services platform continues to be a key contributor to margin expansion and represents a competitive advantage, especially in a high inflationary markets. While our Aon Business Services platform continues to enhance our ability to scale innovation and unlock growth opportunities, it also supports continuous improvement as we automate day-to-day processes around the firm. For instance, our Aon Business Services and commercial risk teams saw automation opportunities specific to insurance. We're now using automation to locate, extract and validate the data, rather than manually pulling it from e-mails and attachments. Over the years, this will save our North American team 83,000 work hours, representing a 30% reduction in total time spent processing service requests with certificates of insurance before further enhancements. We're delivering high-quality client service and enabling our colleagues to spend more time on higher value-added activities and improving colleague engagement. Our Aon Business Services platform enables us to find and capture efficiency opportunities like this around the firm and remains a key driver of ongoing efficiency improvements and margin expansion. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth into double-digit adjusted EPS growth of 15% in Q2 and 14% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.10 per share in Q2 and $0.29 per share year-to-date. It's considered remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.11 per share in the second half or approximately $0.04 in Q3 and $0.07 in Q4 of 2022. Turning to free cash flow and capital allocation. Free cash flow decreased 17% year-to-date to $1,063 million, primarily driven by higher receivables as well as higher incentive compensation payments given our strong 2021 financial results as we described in Q1, offset by strong operating income growth. As we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and free cash flow generation in the second half of the year is seasonally stronger than the first half. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2022. Looking forward, we continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvement. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by approximately $500 million of share repurchase in the quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date. We can also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our priority areas that will bring scalable solution to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. As we've said before, we'll continue to add debt as EBITDA grows, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. Thinking about interest rates. I'd note that our term debt is all fixed rate with an average interest rate of approximately 3.8% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 12 years. I'd also note that our pension liability improves as interest rate increase. And historically, we've taken steps to derisk this liability and reduce volatility. In summary, our strong financial results in the quarter and year-to-date demonstrate continued momentum and progress against our key financial metrics. While we're seeing signs of economic uncertainty, we remain confident in the strength of our firm and our financial guidance for 2022. Overall, our business is resilient, and our Aon United strategy gives us confidence in our ability to deliver results in any economic scenario. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Last quarter on your conference call, you guys had alluded to, if you go into a recession, there could be an impact on the discretionary pieces of your business, which I believe is around 20% of your revenue. I was just hoping for you guys to expand just upon, if we do go into recession later this year or '23, how that could impact revenue in Aon. And I'm assuming like right now, given the growth you saw in the quarter, you're not seeing any signs of a slowdown just yet.
Gregory Case: Elyse, maybe I'll start with that and go to Eric and Christa as well. We tried to convey last quarter, we'll just reinforce this quarter. As we look at the world, as it stands and is evolving, we're in a very unique place, incredibly well positioned. And it really shows through in the first quarter, shown during the second quarter, and we expect through the year and into 2023. If you look at growing risks across the board that clients are looking at, their current businesses, of course, the going risk around supply chain and climate cyber resilience, people aspects, all these things are areas where we have a great opportunity to support clients, and that's coming through. It really comes through across the board on our core book of business and also our investment part of our business. And then the underlying pieces that are talked about, inflation and interest rates, as Christa described, have a positive impact on our business. And finally, Aon Business Services enables us to react and implement solutions globally, while continuing to operate and invest efficiently. So you're seeing us do what we do. We improve and drive a mid-single-digit or greater organic growth, margin improvement and free cash flow growth at a double-digit level. So that's what we want to convey and make sure you understand sort of where we look as we think about the global economy. But Eric, anything else you would add from a client standpoint?
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg. I would say, look, Elyse, it's a great question. And areas of growing risks, like climate change, geopolitical uncertainty, all have a major impact, changing regulation on areas like wealth the focus on workforce resilience, well-being, challenging talent market, you go on and on, health care costs, all issues that our clients are facing irrespective of broader economic conditions. I would also say, the Aon United model that we've built is actually built for moments like this, where our teams are integrating together trying to come up with innovative solutions for clients in a way that pulls all the different capabilities of the firm and can deliver it in one unified fashion. So we think the world isn't getting any less risky. And so the opportunity is there for us to continue to grow our business.
Christa Davies: And Elyse, I'd just add that many of the underlying drivers of GDP, as Greg highlighted, positively impact our business. We've talked about market impact, which has really made up of two components; insurance pricing, which provides modest tailwinds to growth and remain strong; and inflation, which increases insured values, exposures, wages, medical costs, some asset value, all things that positively correlate with our revenue and offset potential pressures while on GDP. We've also mentioned that interest rates have a positive impact on our business through fiduciary investment income. Each 100 basis point increase in interest rates is $60 million top line and bottom line for us. It also decreases our pension unfunded liability, which decreases cash contributions to pensions. And finally, our investment Aon Business Services continues to drive efficiency and support growth while helping mitigate inflationary impacts on our own cost base. So we're very confident of these trends, and the fact that volatility actually creates challenges for other industries that really creates opportunity for us with clients, as Greg and Eric has highlighted.
Elyse Greenspan: That's helpful. And then my second question, Christa, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the slowdown in free cash flow to start the year and mentioned like receivables as part of the reason. So as you think about the back half of the year, do you think cash flow is going to be strong enough that you'll hit the double-digit target this year? I think right decided it's still double-digit growth for 2022.
Christa Davies: We are certainly confident about achieving double-digit growth for 2022 really. And we absolutely -- as you described, second half cash flow is always stronger than first half cash flow. And first half was really impacted by two things; higher receivables, which is really due to stronger organic revenue growth. I would note, by the way, DSO was actually flat. So we're keeping up, but we're not accelerating that, and we have a plan to accelerate and collect receivables much faster. And it was also impacted by incentive compensation payments from a very strong 2021 performance, which is exactly what we had been doing in rewarding our colleagues. And so we're very confident about double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2022 and beyond, 2023 and beyond. So we've got a very strong free cash flow outlook, and we're really excited about deploying that organically in M&A and in share repurchase, which is our highest return on capital opportunity across sale.
Elyse Greenspan: Great. And one last quick following thing. The other income line, you did see gains a couple of quarters in a row in some business sales. Should we model that going forward? I know in the past, you told us just to assume kind of 0 for that line on an ongoing basis.
Christa Davies: We would assume 0 to that line on ongoing basically. What you saw in this quarter was us continuing to manage the portfolio as we do. We continue to invest in higher revenue growth, higher margin, higher return on capital opportunities. And we continue to divest, and this is a small divestment in lower revenue growth, lower margin, lower return on capital opportunities. And so I would continue to model it at 0 going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: I had a couple of questions. First, on margins. You mentioned you expect to improve margins in 2022 and thereafter. I think seasonally, second half should be weaker than the first half, but with -- do you expect to improve margins in the second half as well with a potential increase in T&E versus last year and maybe some inflationary pressures, if you're seeing them.
Christa Davies: Thank you so much for the question. We absolutely agree that we are focused and committed to expanding margins for the full year 2022. We don't give margin guidance right here. We've certainly seen very strong 50 basis points of margin expansion in the first half of the year, and we expect to see full year margin expansion, driven by organic revenue growth; our portfolio mix shift to higher revenue growth, higher-margin areas; and our continued productivity benefits through Aon Business Services, which I mentioned specifically in our prepared remarks. So again, completely committed to full year 2022 margin expansion.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And on fiduciary investment income, I think theoretically, obviously, it's understandable how it should pick up, but rates have been high for a while now, and we haven't seen too much of a pickup. So I'm just wondering if you could comment on the expected lag and what the outlook is for fiduciary investment income, if interest rates stay around current levels maybe a year or two years from now.
Christa Davies: Yes. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, every 100 basis point increase in interest rates, and this is the short end of the curve, is $60 million top line and bottom line for us. I note that our assets in terms of investments on behalf of plans are about 55% in the U.S. and 45% outside the U.S. Our fiducial investment income for Q2 was $9 million. And so it is increasing as interest rates rise.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.
Paul Newsome: I wanted to follow up on Elyse's question about the economic sensitivity. And maybe you could just kind of remind us in contrast with sort of the Aon of today versus the end of past recessions, if we look back. And why would the business mix be -- why is it materially different? And how should we think about sort of the relative sensitivity today versus not? So any sort of magnitude that would be very helpful. And then kind of as a follow-up, as we think further into M&A, does the M&A strategy change in any way because of the recession or the desire to change your economic sensitivity?
Gregory Case: Paul, let's me take both of those 2 big categories, both important. On the first piece, when we talk about mix, Eric's point around how we approach our clients around Aon United is fundamentally different and evolving and getting stronger and stronger. We're bringing the core capability of our firm to clients every day and that really does enhance our ability to grow in the core, but also bring new solutions and ideas to them and also solutions ideas which connect across areas, meaning we're connecting things in D&O with our people business in the ways we haven't done before. That fundamentally changes the risk costs for clients sort of in the D&O world with that piece. That's really cuts across the future. And what we're trying to convey and why we're confident in mid-single-digit or greater growth across all the environments Chris had described is this capability, fundamentally different than it's ever existed before. And we've been working on it for quite some time, and it's really -- it really is reinforced in client and outlook variable to serve clients. So it's exceptionally positive, which is why, as I said before, we're confident, mid-single digit for the year and over time. But it really does show up at a client level. And there are aspects that are discretionary, but those change over time and evolve over time. Overall, the client service leadership capability just continues to strengthen. But additional thoughts and views?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg. And Paul, what I would add is if you go back to 2008 to 2010, that was really the worst economic environment you could design for a company like Aon. It was a global economic recession without inflation and without interest rates, which is pretty unusual. And during 2008 to 2010, Aon grew organically over those two years, our reported revenue grew 6% CAGR over those two years. We expanded margins by 250 basis points, and we grew free cash flow very strongly. And we would say in this environment, there are 3 things that make us stronger than that performance. The first is inflation, which has a positive impact on our revenue, as I described, increasing asset values, employment levels, revenue, et cetera. The second is interest rates, which has a positive impact on fiduciary investment income, as I mentioned, $60 million top line and bottom line for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. And the third, as Greg highlighted, is our investments -- and Eric highlighted, is our investment in Aon United, which allows us to bring together capability to serve clients who, in times of volatility, need us more, whether that's workforce resilience, pension derisking, supply chain, climate, a number of different areas. So we feel very good about our ability to navigate through, which is why we're reiterating the guidance we have for full year 2022 and beyond, with single-digit organic revenue growth, margin expansion for the full year and double-digit free cash flow growth.
Gregory Case: And so maybe if we could take a minute and then Paul will come back to your other question, also equally important, around M&A, what we're up to and how we're thinking about it. We are seeing a revolving market. It's terrific. But maybe it's helpful to start just with you on just overall capital allocation, how we're thinking about it, because there's really opportunity on the M&A front. But elsewhere, and then Eric, some examples that we're seeing and some things we've done recently.
Eric Andersen: Christa, would you like to…
Christa Davies: Absolutely. And look, I'll just say firstly, Greg, our M&A pipeline is really strong. And we are continuing to invest organically and inorganically in areas of great growth and great margin expansion, data analytics with Tyche, digital with CoverWallet, a number of other areas across our business, where we're seeing enormous client need, supply chain, workforce resilience, climate, et cetera. And then I would say we continue to operate in a very disciplined way on return on capital. So as we generate very strong free cash flow for full year 2022, we expect our highest and best use of cash will remain share repurchase because we remain undervalued today. We remain undervalued at our peak pricing of 3 50. And so we continue to invest in share repurchase because it remains the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon. And for us to invest in M&A or organically in any of these very, very attractive opportunities, it has to be share repurchase because that's the bar. But Eric, you are in the middle of a lot of the great investments in our business and including in M&A, maybe you can talk a little bit more about this.
Eric Andersen: Sure, Christa. And maybe I'll just touch on the Tyche platform that we acquired just as a way to tie some of these pieces together. And for those that remember, Tyche was really about enhancing the capability around capital modeling that we do around reserving and pricing, predominantly for the life and non-life business on the reinsurance side. But ultimately, where we see it going over time is how we extend the platform beyond insurers to corporate clients as many of these large corporates with big balance sheets are looking to optimize their own risk strategies across insurance, captive, self-insurance, etcetera and need better information to be able to do it. So the ability to add that team and that talent to be able to provide that existing impact to our insurance clients from reinsurance angle, but then use that capability across the broader firm is one of the areas of why we were so interested in Tyche. And it's also just worth saying that once you acquire an asset like that, getting them involved in the Aon United mindset, how we actually integrate them and leverage their capabilities across a broader firm has been what we've been working on over the last couple of months and I think just build confidence in our ability to use that kind of capability across the broader firm.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Christa, last quarter, you made some commentary around the discretionary parts of your business. I was just wondering if you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of leading indicators of demand on those discretionary businesses, specifically in the second quarter?
Christa Davies: Sure. So look, what you're seeing, David, is very strong growth across our business, 8% growth in the quarter, 8% growth year-to-date. And we're reiterating guidance of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year, exactly the outlook we started the year with. So we continue to see strong areas of demand from clients in the core and in the discretionary areas, really, David, because in times of volatility, a lot of the services we're offering clients are in greater demand. And so whether that's supply chain volatility; whether that's market volatility, which is creating opportunities for pension derisking, attention buyout by end; whether that's workforce resilience with that supply chain, there are so many areas of increased demand from clients in times of disruption.
David Motemaden: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And Greg, last question I'd ask -- or last quarter, I had asked a question around just new headcount, and you spoke more about focusing on productivity. And I think on this call, Christa, you made some interesting comments on just how Aon Business Services is helping enhance productivity. So I'm wondering if you could just help me think about -- are there any metrics you look at internally just on producer productivity? And maybe you can just share how much those have increased over the last several years and sort of the outlook going forward, just on producer productivity.
Gregory Case: David, thanks. We love the question around talent. It's the heart of our firm. Everything we do comes back to our colleagues as they support clients. And we continue to invest very substantially in attracting and retaining talent. And it's been the strategy for forever at Aon and continues to be. But as Christa described and I described, we are investing in capability to do that more effectively. So yes, last time, we talked about productivity. Productivity for us is helping our colleagues do more with clients. They love it. When they consider across the table and allow a client on new ideas, it's a tremendous outcome. And we are developing content capability that makes it easier and easier for them to do that. So yes, not just bringing talent in, but making talent better, not just bigger, but better. And it really is at an individual level working to do that. It's why, as I described in Q2, we recorded the highest-ever engagement we've ever had from our poll survey. So you see that from the standpoint of how colleagues are reacting to that. And our volunteer attrition, for example, is way back in line with where it was pre-pandemic. So all things are coming together very, very positively and continue to reinforce each other from an overall talent perspective. And we'll take energy and efforts to sort of make investments, wherever we need to, to support our business and to support our client leadership. Eric, you're leading us every day at a talent level, it's so fundamental. What do you see?
Eric Andersen: Thanks, Greg. It's a great question and one that's really important to us and we spend a lot of time on. And we have been making investments, which are really exciting. I would say they come in like 3 buckets. The first is we're investing in client leadership, especially people who have industry focus and deep understanding of client-specific challenges. We're also investing organically in some of the areas we've been talking about, like climate, cyber, IP, analytics, all the areas where we think we can add real value to clients and need expertise to be able to provide that value. And then the third, and we talked a little bit about it with Tyche, but CoverWallet, the same through M&A, we're bringing in expertise not only from a people perspective but a technology perspective as well. And then critical to, I think, Greg, just picking up on your last point, making sure that we embed that talent in the firm, so that the broader firm can use it and leverage it with their clients, using that Aon United model to get that talent across all types of clients around the world is critical, but really focused on making sure we've got the best talent in the industry. And I think we're making great progress.
Gregory Case: Eric, two great examples as you sort of go back in time, we're talking now CoverWallet and Tyche. But if you go back in time, the investments we made in cyber have been phenomenal, both on the acquisition front and M&A front. It's put us in an unbelievable position to serve clients today in a category. Also go back to 601 left. We haven't talked about on these calls for quite some time a few years ago. Now we've evolved with what was a truly world-class capability and the 200 colleagues working on intellectual property. And we put the example out today on sort of after a number of years, sort of what we're seeing, $1 billion now across the threshold on IP debt. So these are all the things that we think are fundamental, David, to come into this. And we track it carefully, as you might expect, and we're seeing results in progression. I do want to just touch on the Aon Business Services and did Christa highlight that again, too, because that also is an area that helps us scale capability that reinforces talent. So Christa, do you want to talk about ABS for a minute?
Christa Davies: Yes. Look, a really important part of our talent strategy is Aon Business Services. As you've heard us say before, it's not just driving efficiency but enabling us to increase growth and scale innovation much faster. And for the power of Aon Business Services will enable to drive efficiency in our core operations, which helps offset the trends we see around wage inflation, enabling us to continue to invest in talent and people, which drive long-term margin expansion. So we're really excited about Aon Business Services, helps us accelerate Aon United.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Study aside, I guess, the Symantec game right now. I don't mean you, I mean, politically. We've gone through 2 quarters of contracting real GDP growth. Can you talk about how that impacted your first half results relative to expectations?
Gregory Case: Mark? Go ahead, Christa.
Christa Davies: Yes. So look, I would start with, we've seen really strong revenue growth, 8% in Q1, 8% in Q2, 8% year-to-date. And we continue to reiterate guidance for the full year exactly as we did at the beginning of the year, mid-single digital, greater organic revenue growth, margin expand for the full year and double-digit free cash flow growth. So we're seeing opportunities, Meyer, whether it's installation, which positively impacts our revenue in driving up asset values, driving up employment levels, driving up corporate revenues; whether it's interest rates, which obviously positively impact, both on the revenue side in terms of fiduciary investment income; or whether it's volatility and clients needing us more on the supply chain, workforce resilience, pension derisking in times of increased volatility. But Greg, what would you say?
Gregory Case: I think you captured it well. Meyer, just trying to reinforce in every way we can, mid- to single digit or greater in terms of some of the performance for the year and ongoing for lots of different ways and perspectives that we've been able to accomplish that. And you've just seen it. You've seen the performance. You've see by the way, when we think about growth, it's not just top line growth, it's also operating income growth and free cash flow growth, as Christa described as well.
Meyer Shields: Okay. No, that's helpful. Second, maybe more detailed question because we've been talking a little bit about CoverWallet. I was hoping you can just update us on how consumer or, I should say, customer willingness to use technologies like CoverWallet, how is that evolving over time?
Gregory Case: Excellent. Eric, why don't you take that one?
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg, I will. It's a great question and something we're really excited about as a platform. And there's 2 ways you use it. You use a direct-to-consumer, which continues to be sort of the base of what CoverWallet was when we acquired it, and that continues to grow. But where we're actually seeing great opportunity is how we bring CoverWallet to our existing clients that have large distribution issues on their own, whether it's rideshare companies or dealerships or what have you, where they need to provide product to a broad number of people, think of it from a B2B2C perspective versus a direct-to-consumer. And so when you look at our enterprise client strategy and our ability to get to those large clients with this capability, as they're trying to provide value either to their own colleagues or to their business partners, it does give us a platform that we think drives great growth for us and rounds out the relationships that we have with these clients in a way we're providing real value. So we bought it as a D2C, and we've been able to expand it into the B2B2C arena and are having some good success with it.
Gregory Case: And when you think about it, Meyer, this is really about -- not in really introducing technology. You're sitting across the label from a client. Again, as I've got, as Eric described, get-goers [ph] around the world and essentially saying, "Hey, we think we can actually help you provide service to them with a really clean, tight interface that does things that help them manage their business on your behalf." We can do it globally. That's just not something that anyone can say. The behind-the-scenes technology is massive. Now behind sees technology and IP, intellectual property is also massive, but you're not having that conversation. The conversation is our colleagues, essentially asking someone who's got a growth business, "Hey, would you like to actually raise growth capital in a way that doesn't dilute your equity ownership?" And so the technology, the content is all behind that and reinforces that. And so the introduction of technology to the clients is really through helping them win in their business. And that's where we found great receptivity.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Rob Cox: I was hoping to get a little more color on what's driving the strong growth in Health Solutions broadly, and if you could quantify how meaningful the benefit from the timing of revenues was in the core health and benefits brokerage business in the quarter?
Gregory Case: Excellent. I love this question, Rob. And we love this category, as we talked about before, so much going on around the global world with Health. And it really does cut across regions beyond just a specific area. But Eric, thoughts on the progression in health.
Eric Andersen: Sure. I think when you look at the long-term outlook, certainly helping the clients mitigate health care costs and improving employee health and well-being is a great business at the moment, and I think we're really confident in it. The growth has come from all geographies. And it's driven by retention, renewals, project work across the broad segment of that area, but also great growth related to the well-being and employee resilience part of health; the human capital piece with the Data Solutions growth, the advisory work really broad-based in terms of its impact we're having with clients across all of our geographies.
Rob Cox: Got it. And then on the timing benefit on revenues in the quarter, is there any way to quantify that?
Christa Davies: Yes. So what I would say is, we haven't disclosed it, but what we have said is, it's come from Q3 into Q2. So it's not material world, but you should see some small amount in Q3 than you would otherwise expect.
Rob Cox: Okay. Got it. And then just lastly, I was just hoping to ask a question on Aon's ability to negotiate tire pricing and some of the fee-based businesses in light of inflation. And if you've seen any greater success in doing so in certain fee-based businesses versus others.
Gregory Case: Well, the conversation we have with our clients always is about value, the value we provide for them, how we build teams that support them and create. And then having to establish that, they have to understand the value, I appreciate the value. And then we talk about what's fair in the context of sort of how we are compensated for that. So that's been something we always do. Ours is about higher value. We want to bring more incremental value to clients than anyone else in more over time. And in doing so, we have been rewarded for that as it relates to value for clients. And so we continue to do that. And we're having the progression this year, just like we had last year and the years before.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS.
Weston Bloomer: One follow-up question on organic growth within reinsurance. You highlighted strong growth in both treaty and facultative in the quarter. Swift, the facultative piece, understanding it's more transactional in nature and second half weight. Just curious on your outlook for facultative placements in the second half of the year. Any tailwinds worth pointing out? Or is facultative growing faster or slower than 3D currently?
Eric Andersen: Facultative has been a great business for us over many years. And if you put it in the context of the overall market, where many of the insurers continue to remediate their portfolios, and they often do that through the use of facultative placements in order to maintain their direct client relationship. So fact for us around the world continues to be a great business, and we had created value with it and expect that, that would continue as we go forward.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to Mr. Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory Case: Thanks very much and just wanted to say to everybody, I appreciate you being part of the call and look forward to our discussion next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-29 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2022 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We'd like to start by acknowledging the tremendous work of our colleagues across the firm. They continue to exhibit remarkable leadership, supporting clients in a challenging environment. We also want to thank our colleagues for their inspiring support of our team, their families and others who have been impacted by the Russian war in Ukraine. This is a tragic example of increasing global volatility adding to the challenges of facing organizations and invites every day, including continued effects of COVID-19, especially in Asia; inflation; climate change; capital availability; and connected impact to supply chains, intellectual property, workforce resilience and retirement readiness. In this environment, helping our clients protect and grow their businesses, support their employees, their communities and their stakeholders has never been more important. Turning to financial performance. Our team delivered an excellent first quarter and start to the year with 8% organic revenue growth, an increase from a strong prior year performance of 6% in Q1 2021. This top line strength translated to a 38% adjusted operating margin, an increase of 60 basis points and 13% adjusted EPS growth, demonstrating the power of our Aon Business Services platform to drive sustainable margin expansion as well as support growth. Within our solution lines, we would highlight in Commercial Risk, we delivered 9% organic revenue growth with growth in every major geography and particular strength across renewals and retention. Our teams are working incredibly hard to make sure our clients have the right coverage that fully considers the impact of inflation and other economic factors. Reinsurance Solutions organic revenue grew 7% driven by continued strength in retention and new business generation around the world as we help clients navigate a complicated and challenging risk environment. In Health Solutions, organic revenue grew 8%, reflecting global strength in core health and benefits and advisory work, especially around well-being and resilience. We also saw double-digit growth in consumer benefit solutions and human capital. And we would note particular strength in our rewards and corporate governance and ESG practices as we see our clients increasingly focus on talent, compensation and risks and opportunities related to ESG. And finally, Wealth Solutions organic revenue growth was flat in the quarter. Our retirement investments team continues to do excellent work, helping our clients address ongoing opportunities as well as regulatory changes and challenges. Priority development areas like delegated investment management and growth in pool of employer plans were a highlight in the quarter. Looking ahead and fully recognizing increasing uncertainty in global complexity, for the full year 2022 and over the long term, we continue to expect mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth. We also continue to expect margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2022 and over the long term. As we reflect on the strong combination of organic revenue growth and margin expansion in the quarter and our expectations for the year, we would highlight that our Aon Business Services platform is becoming an increasingly powerful tool for client service and growth in addition to driving ongoing efficiency gains.  For example, in recent discussions with a multinational chemical company, our Aon Business Services client dashboard changed the game on how we interact with them on their M&A growth strategy. Comprehensive data sets easily acceptable to our team enable them to bring insights around the value of the client's intellectual property as a driver of their priority M&A activity. This created great value for them and opened up substantial opportunities for us in many areas, including transactional liability and intellectual property solutions. More simply, these analytics help us identify innovative opportunities and where we might be underpenetrated today by geography or by solution line. In another example, Aon Business Services is equally powerful supporting our work with clients and ESG, an increasingly wide-ranging topic for our clients. Our ESG practice with the human capital solutions specializes in assessing and prioritizing risks and opportunities for our clients across their stakeholder base and their business. Our ESG risk assessment tool allows clients to monitor key risks in real time and is focused on specific client priorities given their business, geography, industry and competitive landscape. The tool links those risks to Aon Insight, experts and solutions to drive sustainability, model their climate risk, better navigate the D&O or cyber landscape and reinforce their culture to strengthen their people strategy. And specifically on environmental risk, we're using our proprietary climate analytics to quantify the impacts of climate change on our clients' physical assets, which then helps inform risk mitigation and improve resilience. The power of this capability is not just in developing innovative solutions. While the ways in which it helps colleagues better inform and advise our clients, it's also in our ability to connect and scale distribution of these solutions across the firm, including in our acquisitions where we bring an expertise with the express intent to scale new capabilities. In the latest example, we recently announced the acquisition of a U.K.-based technology company, Tyche, and we're delighted to welcome our new colleagues to Aon. The actuarial software platform they’ve built enhances our balance sheet modeling capability, especially in reserving and pricing, and allows us to enhance our analytics offering to a broad base of reinsurance clients and commercial risk clients with complex balance sheet. Tyche's differentiator is to strengthen speed of simulations, enabling our teams to model complex risk transparently to help our clients better understand both risk and meet evolving regulatory requirements.  Scaling the formidable capability that Tyche brings reinforces our broader strategy by enhancing our analytical tools and actuarial modeling capabilities. This will enable us to advise and execute across the insurance industry with clients and help them meet their goals of ongoing growth, capital management, and ultimately, economic returns. In summary, our strong first quarter results reinforce continued momentum and position us well to deliver on our key metrics over the full year. While we continue to anticipate the volatility of all kinds and its impact on our relations will continue to grow, in this environment, our Aon United strategy and Business Services platform both become more relevant. The capability and track record that we've built gives us confidence in our ability to drive further value for our clients, colleagues, society and shareholders. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our performance and long-term outlook.
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered a strong operational and financial performance in the first quarter to start the year, highlighted by 8% organic revenue growth that translated into 60 basis points of margin expansion and double-digit growth in earnings per share. We look forward to building on this momentum through the rest of 2022. As I reflect on the quarter, first, organic revenue growth was 8% driven by strong ongoing retention and net new business generation. I would note that total revenue growth of 4% includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX driven primarily by a weaker euro versus the dollar as Q1 is just our seasonally largest quarter for euro-denominated revenues. As we look to the rest of 2022, we're continuing to monitor various macroeconomic factors, including the underlying drivers of GDP, inflation and interest rates, which all impact our clients and our business. In particular, I would note a few interrelated impacts. On GDP, we've noted there's a correlation between our revenue and GDP growth, particularly the underlying drivers of GDP, such as asset values, corporate revenues and employment levels. We've recently seen decreases in global GDP growth forecast for the year driven by the factors such as ongoing impacts of COVID-related restrictions, the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and expected increases in interest rates. As we've communicated previously, our revenue base is very resilient. An impact from GDP tend to shovel the more discretionary portions of our business, such as project-related work across the portfolio. These portions of our business were strong in Q1. Though, as Greg mentioned, we're seeing increased uncertainty in overall trends. I would also note there are many ways in which we can help clients in terms of challenging economic circumstances or increased volatility. On inflation, we see impacts to our revenue and expense base. On revenue, inflation increases underlying exposures across our business, for instance, in property values and health care costs. As Greg mentioned, we're working with our clients to ensure they're appropriately protected against these increasing values and optimizing their total cost of risk. On expenses, we're continuing to invest in our colleagues and are hiring support growth, especially in priority areas. This does increase overall compensation costs, although Aon Business Services strategy continues to drive efficiency in operations and support our goal of ongoing margin expansion. And on interest rates, there are puts and takes at play. But generally, we are very well positioned for higher interest rates. While revenue in some areas of our business like construction and transaction liability is often dependent on client investment behavior, which may be impacted by rising interest rates, I would highlight 3 main points on how we benefit from higher interest rates. First, we see investment income increases as short-term interest rates rise. Over the course of the year, a 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates, such as the U.S. federal plus rate and ECB deposit facility rate, translates to an impact of about $60 million in total revenue and operating income. Second, our pension liability improved as increases in interest rates result in higher discount rates used to value our pension obligations. Third, our term debt is all fixed rate with an average rate of 3.8%. So the interest expense associated with our existing term debt does not increase. Overall, our business is resilient, and our Aon United strategy gives us confidence in our ability to deliver results in any economic scenario. As Greg said, we do see increased external volatility; however, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for 2022 and over the long term. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement with adjusted operating margins of 38%, an increase of 60 basis points, driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from our Aon Business Services platform, overcoming a negative impact of FX and expense growth, which includes investment in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth and some resumption of T&E. As we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of the full year. We expect continued investment in colleagues and ongoing resumption of T&E throughout the year. We expect to deliver margin expansion in 2022 as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth into double-digit adjusted EPS growth of 13% for the quarter. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.19 per share on the quarter. If currency remains stable at today's rates, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.08 per share or approximately $24 million decrease in operating income in the second quarter of 2022. Turning to free cash flow and capital allocation. Free cash flow decreased 17% to $440 million, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation payouts given our strong 2021 financial results. I would note that we had strong growth in the prior year period and that Q1 has historically been our seasonally smallest quarter from a cash flow standpoint due primarily to incentive compensation payments. As we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2022. Looking forward, we expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term driven by operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural uses of cash enabled by Aon Business Services. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today even at all-time highs, highlighted by approximately $800 million of share repurchases in the first quarter. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities to address unmet client need, as we've done with Tyche. Our M&A pipeline is focused on our high-priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. As we've said in the past, we continue to assess all capital allocation decisions and manage our portfolio on a return-on-capital basis. Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In Q1, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes. We estimate our leverage ratios to be within the range expected for our current investment-grade credit ratings. As we've said before, we'll continue to evaluate the opportunity to add debt as EBITDA grows while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. In summary, our first quarter results reflect strong top and bottom line performance driven by our Aon United strategy. We start the year in a position of strength and expect to continue to make progress on our key financial metrics and drive shareholder value creation. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question is on the reinsurance business. You guys saw 7% organic growth. It is a deceleration where you guys have been over the past few quarters. Was just hoping to get a little bit more color, just business impacted by something during the January 1 renewals? Is there just some timing? Just kind of what you saw with the next set and how we should think about growth within that business for the rest of the year? 
Greg Case: Step back and think about what our colleagues have accomplished over the last number of years in reinsurance and it's really been extraordinary. And we just see so much opportunity in this space. By the way, Tyche that I described on the call that Christa followed up on is a real direct sort of investment in content capability that we'll even enhance. So we're doubling down on the opportunity sort of in this category. And really, the quarter doesn't reflect the continued momentum. By the way, 7%, strong first quarter, great capability. But we see tremendous momentum in this business and just great opportunity. But Eric, specifics around this, do you think?
Eric Andersen : Sure, Greg. And I would say, listen, it was a very strong quarter for the team. We had fantastic growth in the ILS business with the cat bond issuance very strong. In fact, a lot of great work with clients as they look to reposition their portfolio going into the January 1 renewal cycle. So I would say it was a very strong start for the year, I have high expectations for them as they continue to work through the existing insurance cycles, but a really strong start for them.
Elyse Greenspan: And then on the margin side, last year, continuing you started to see that pick up in the back half of the year. So given just that kind of comps related to T&E get a little bit easier in the back half of this year? Do you think that we're positioned to see stronger margin improvement in the back half than perhaps I see in the first half? Or is there anything else that we need to think about with the cadence of expenses this year?
Christa Davies: Thanks for the question, Elyse. So I would say we think about margins over the course of a full year and don't really give specific guidance by quarter at least. But what I would say is we've delivered 1,100 basis points of margin expansion over the last 10 years, so approximately 100 basis points a year. And we'll continue to grow margins in 2022 driven by 3 key things: strong revenue growth; a portfolio mix shift to higher revenue growth, higher-margin areas; and leverage from our own business services where we're getting productivity each and every year. Those sort of drivers of margin expansion will be offset by our continued investment in colleagues, increased T&E and investments to grow the business long term. And I would note that we did deliver 160 basis points of margin expansion in 2021. So it's a very strong comparable. And we do expect to deliver margin expansion for the full year 2022, so we're very excited about that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar.
Jimmy Bhullar : Greg, I just wanted to see if you could comment on how you think the operating environment for your business has changed in the past few months. I think, obviously, pricing is still a tailwind, but it seems like it's slowing. The economic outlook is less clear than it was maybe a few months ago. But how have your views changed on how business trends are?
Greg Case : Well, there's no doubt -- I appreciate the question. There's no doubt there's obviously a lot going on out there in terms of sort of overall complexity and volatility, which is showing up all the things you described. I do want to start with, we're very confident when you look across that, take all that into consideration, both Christa and I emphasized mid-single-digit growth or greater in 2022 and over the long term. So we'll start with that. But we've just got great momentum. And the uncertainty, in many respects, means clients are asking us and talking to us about how they manage the volatility in their business. But if you think about the momentum coming out of 2021, highest annual growth in a couple of decades, and we just delivered a Q1 2022 that was higher than the Q1 2021 in that comparable quarter and the highest year ever. So we feel very, very good about where we are in the context of a very uncertain world. But it really shows up kind of -- with clients sitting across the table day to day. Maybe, Eric, you can provide a couple of examples, because I think its really where it comes to life.
Eric Andersen : Yes. Sure, Greg. And I would say that the results of the core have been very strong and just the work that we're doing each day across all of our solution lines. But I would also say there's a couple of key risks that the teams are engaged in that are very much on the clients' mind today, topics like supply chain, with what's going on in the world, colleague resilience, climate, cyber, pandemic, things that honestly, 3 years ago, 4 years ago, were not a big deal for them but today are very much on their focus. So we feel good about the growth prospects and our ability to help clients work on those emerging issues as we go forward. And I would also maybe add one other comment that the issues that people are talking about today really do merge for a specific client. So whether it's inflation or GDP or political risk or what have you, we just came out of our RIMS conference, where we had dozens of client meetings. And the themes across them were very much, as clients were thinking about investing in their business, whether it was building a plant, making an acquisition, expanding into new areas, they were thinking about GDP growth. They were thinking about inflation, but they were also thinking about labor costs and colleague impact and resilience.  And so having that ability to have a holistic conversation with them as they strategically plan for their future, recognizing all the sense that risk today is more heightened than it has been historically, I think, really does play well to us and lets us have real impact for those clients.
Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And relatedly, there were concerns around disruption in your business given the merger and the fallout from that last year. And I think you had some high-profile departures as well, but it doesn't seem like we're seeing that in your results. But if you could just talk about employee retention and how it's trended over the past several months. And do you expect any sort of slowdown in your business because of people you might have lost?
Greg Case : Really quite the opposite of it. I think that we've been fortunate this quarter. As we've reported for the last number of quarters, we have exceptionally high retention. And in fact, voluntary attrition is at levels better than they were pre-COVID; and engagement levels 80%, plus. So this is about as strong as you get in terms of sort of where we are from a talent standpoint. And again, you know the momentum come out of 2021 and now the momentum going into 2022. So those, I think, are exceptionally positive. There's a point here that's important in terms of how we support our colleagues so they can support our clients. And yes, it means we're investing in new types of talent, for sure, but it also means, and Eric talked about this earlier, we're investing in developing our colleagues, the talent we have now on supporting them. And we've got to do it not just with talk. It's really supporting them with content, capability, enabling technology, real evolving, advanced analytics that accelerate innovation in what we do for clients. So this is critically important. Let's see where we come back and say the Aon Business Services platform is really essential. This is something that's been underway for 4 years. It really has driven -- helped drive the margin improvement, as Christa described. But more than that, it's created surplus to invest in innovation, things like IP, et cetera. And we've got 200 colleagues in IP right now that we're working through very, very positively. So a lot going on there, and that combination puts us in a very, very good spot.
Eric Andersen : Greg, maybe if I could just add as well because I do think you raised a great point about attrition and engagement and the like. But where we're investing in talent is really where we see the business going over the next couple of years. Like I mentioned to the previous question, climate, ESG, colleague resilient, cyber, these are areas that have -- that require deep expertise. And so when we're making investments either in capability or in talent, we're focusing it there. But once you get them in the firm, the key through this delivering Aon United strategy that we've been employing. How do you bring them together so that they understand the client need, working with our other experts to be able to deliver to the client the solution that they need or the advice that they want? And so there is a great opportunity for us to continue to invest. By the way, also investing substantially in the core to making sure that what we do for clients today have the right amount of expertise, the right service teams and the like. So I think we feel pretty good about our talent strategy and where we are and are optimistic about the future with them.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: One technical question. As I understand it, the language used for stopping operations in Russia is suspending rather than, I guess, terminating them. Does that mean if there's an office to organic growth in -- from discontinued Russian services right now?
Greg Case : As you highlighted -- And Chris, you covered it perfectly. There is not -- it's really, in the end, very, very minimal impact overall in terms of our core business. Obviously, a lot going on as we support clients and are in the process of suspending operations, but minimal impact.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Second question and sort of related to what's been asked already. But right now, there seems to be, I don't know what the right word is, a frenzy of newly formed or newly strengthened reinsurance brokers that want to rapidly become, I guess, the #4 in the marketplace. And I'm wondering whether that's actually impacting the competitive environment for reinsurance brokerage.
Greg Case : Listen, as we step back, we see opportunity on the reinsurance side, as we said before. We love this opportunity. And it isn't just with our insurance clients. It is -- and by the way, it's formidable there. And what we're doing with Tyche and our team is really coming together with a capability that really addresses client need. It's exactly what Eric talked about before. That's what we're about. And we see tremendous opportunity there. Also some of the capabilities on the reinsurance side, what we do for insurers, is becoming more and more applicable in the commercial marketplace. The most sophisticated companies in the world are -- require the kind of analytics that a decade ago only insurers really looked to receive. And so for us, we see a tremendous, tremendous opportunity. And a lot of what you see us doing is not just competing in the existing market as it stands today, but it is truly creating that new market. And what we're doing across the board in climate, in that new market, some of the work we're doing in IP, it's core to market but also net-net new market. And so what we're essentially saying is we're going to increase the size of the pie with the content and the analytics we have and the capability and the columns we have in place, and we see tremendous opportunity over time. It's a big contributor as we think about mid-single digit or greater over time. Eric, anything else you add to that through the detail?
Eric Andersen : Maybe, Greg the only thing I would add, Greg, you said it well is having global capability, having deep analytical insight, being able to deal with clients' needs using the global marketplace, all critical to the core of what we do today for our reinsurance clients and we'll continue to do. But I do think you hit it well: a lot of the issues that the insurance company clients have today are these future risks, trying to handle cyber as a product, trying to think through climate, if you're a homeowner's insurer, if you're a P&C insurer, how you deal with life from a mortality risk if it's pandemic. So the opportunities for us there are very strong. And so I'm not surprised if it's drawing competition. That's okay. The reality is we feel good that our franchise and the team, very closely aligned, and we continue to make investments to make sure they have cutting-edge capabilities.
Operator: Our final question comes from David Motemaden.
David Motemaden: I had a question. Greg, you spoke about voluntary attrition continuing to be at favorable levels to pre-COVID levels. But I guess I'm wondering if you could just talk about how new head count adds have trended over the last few quarters, over the last year or 2, compared to pre-'19 or pre-COVID levels.
Greg Case : I'll offer an observation, but we don't talk about head count per se. For us, it's just not how we think about talent. We're investing -- we describe the port really in content capability so that our colleagues get better. They see opportunity differently. They grow professionally. And literally just adding someone is very different than developing organic capability and helping a colleague get better. So again, forward analytics, Eric just talked about reinsurance, are all forward analytics. You're no longer looking in the rearview mirror and thinking about what was there. You're thinking about how you model what's going to happen. You put that in the hands of your colleagues, its extremely powerful, and it really is a new way to -- an evolving way to compete. And we've been adding capability in the form of colleagues to do that, absolutely. And we've been adding organically in terms of investment in more analytics and support our colleagues. So it has been trending very, very positively. It's led to, as you've seen us report, top line growth, which is a record for us; operating performance, record for us; and trends in free cash flow, a record for us. And this Aon Business Services platform in the context of that is really unique. It's the next chapter because it's not just about efficiency, it really is about how we work more effectively with our clients on behalf -- with our colleagues.
David Motemaden: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question in Commercial Risk Solutions. In the press release I saw it mentioned double-digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Asia-Pac. I didn't see a comment on EMEA and the U.K. So I guess I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on how growth trended there throughout the quarter and also how expectations are there, given what looks like a potential severe slowdown in the economy in that region.
Eric Andersen : Sure, Greg. Maybe I'll take this one. This is Eric. From a Commercial Risk standpoint, our U.K. and EMEA business actually had very solid quarters both from a client retention, new business development and the like. I would say, certainly, the war in Ukraine is closer to home for them, and it's certainly a topic of their clients' discussion. How topics like supply chain, political risk credit are all sort of front of mind for a number of those clients. It is an opportunity in the end for us to provide real value for those clients on those topics. And so I would say we're focused very much on the well-being of the colleagues that were affected that are often familiar personally to a lot of our EMEA colleagues, and they're doing all the right things there, which I think ultimately helps build the culture. But certainly, the work and the need from the clients on our European clients and our U.K. clients is almost more heightened than it is in other parts of the world because they're so close to it. But they had very strong first quarter, is expected to have a very solid year as we go through '22.
David Motemaden: Okay. Great. And maybe if I could just sneak one more in. The line item I look at when I look through the results of Aon and I'm not totally sure how to think about is the other income line item, which has bounced around a lot. It was $25 million this quarter. Is there a way I should think about that going forward? Is there any help you can provide me as I think about the earnings power of Aon going forward?
Christa Davies: So what happened there in that quarter was just continued portfolio management. So you should think about our business, we continue to manage the portfolio on an ROIC basis. And we divested some lower-growth, lower-return businesses. And we model that other income line as 0 ourselves. But what we would say is, as you continue to think about Aon, we will continue to improve performance, driving revenue growth, higher revenue growth, higher-margin investments organically and inorganically and continue to divest lower-revenue growth, lower-margin portions of our portfolio. So that's what you saw again in this quarter.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue. And now back to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case : I just want to say thanks very much, everyone, for joining the call. We appreciate it, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc. You may begin.
Greg Case: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. Our strong performance in 2021 is the direct result of deliberate steps we've taken that are enabling us to win more, do more and retain more with clients. We're driving top and bottom line results and are exceptionally well positioned to continue to deliver ongoing performance in 2022 and over the long-term. Most important, we want to express deep gratitude to our Aon colleagues around the world for their performance and results this year and for everything they've done for clients and for each other. Our colleagues delivered a fantastic Q4 and a very strong finish to an outstanding year. We achieved organic revenue growth of 10% in the fourth quarter, with double-digit growth in Commercial Risk and Reinsurance, driven by net new business generation and client retention. In Commercial Risk, we saw strength across the world, driven by net new business and retention in the core. We also saw strength in more discretionary areas of the portfolio as economic growth and client activity continued to increase, including double-digit growth in project-related work, and in transaction solutions as our teams responded to M&A deal flow and increased client demand. Within Health and Wealth Solutions, we saw double-digit growth in priority areas that we've been disproportionately investing in, in the last several years, including voluntary benefits in Health Solutions and in delegated investment management in Wealth Solutions, which remains an essential part of our portfolio. Our full year organic revenue growth of 9% reflects the strength and momentum of our Aon United strategy, which is designed to drive top and bottom line results. To that point, operating income increased 17% year-over-year; full year operating margins expanded 160 basis points to 30.1%, with margins of 32.8% in the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing efficiency improvements, net of investment and long-term growth; earnings per share increased 22% for the full year; free cash flow exceeded $2 billion; and we completed $3.5 billion of share buyback in 2021, a strong indication of our confidence in the long-term value of the firm. Looking forward to 2022 and beyond, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth. Looking back on the year, we would offer three observations that drove performance in '21 and reinforce our continued strong momentum in 2022. First, as complexity and uncertainty has increased around the world, clients are demanding a partner capable of providing them greater clarity and confidence to make better decisions that will protect and grow their businesses. In 2021, organizations and individuals continue to face the ongoing challenges of COVID and resulting effects in supply chain, growing concerns over climate change, commercial property, retirement readiness, regulatory changes, cyber and workforce resilience. Against that backdrop, our decade-plus focus on Aon United and the content capability it allows us to deliver has never been more relevant. Second, our colleagues feel that relevance, and they take great pride in our ability to deliver existing and new sources of value to clients. They recognize that these external challenges facing our clients create opportunity for them to bring better solutions and grow professionally. We know this is what engages our colleagues and why they're feeling more relevant, more connected and more valued. And we're seeing the impact of this focus. In our recent all-colleague survey, engagement levels remain at all-time highs, in line with top-quartile employers. Ultimately, we know that by creating an exceptional colleague experience or ensuring a better client experience, both of which translate into better performance for the firm. And third, we continue to accelerate our innovation strategy by using our Aon United operating model to replicate successful solutions and applying those capabilities to new client bases, paving the way for innovation at scale. We're incorporating our data, analytics and insight to direct existing capabilities to previously unmet client needs. This allows us to serve existing clients in new and customized ways, bring existing solutions to new clients and expand our addressable market. Let me highlight a few examples that demonstrate how we scale innovation to help our clients, both in new ways and from new sources. Historically, you heard us talk about Aon Client Treaty, pre-underwritten insurance capacity we established at Lloyd's that we used to offer clients more easily and efficiently access capital for their placements. When we designed this program over five years ago, we analyzed every historic placement, quantified the risk parameters around business replacement on Lloyd's and then prearranged capital to back those risks. Aon Client Treaty provides more efficient access to capital for clients and insurers, and we see ongoing opportunity to apply this concept to different geographies and risk classes using the same proprietary data and analytics backbone supported by Aon Business Services. One new offering derived directly from this capability is a solution the team designed called Marilla, which enables reinsurers and investors to invest across our global reinsurance client portfolio. This provides a broad entry point into global reinsurance risk that benefits our clients by enabling capital to access markets more efficiently. This first-of-its-kind solution could not have been designed without a proprietary analytic capability, and we see important opportunities to build on this platform for future growth across Aon. Another example to highlight is within voluntary benefits, where we're developing innovative solutions at scale and driving double-digit growth. The offering combines user insight around enrollment from our active healthcare exchanges and capabilities from acquisitions like Univers and Farmington. Our analytics platform and dashboards assess and illustrate planned features, product usage, claims experience and overall plant performance, providing insight into employee demand and satisfaction. This work has been formed by 20 years of enrollment data from over 4 million participants, which enables us to rapidly develop bespoke solutions for our clients that strengthen their total rewards offering and reinforce their human capital strategy at a time when this has never been more essential. These examples demonstrate how we help our clients access capital end markets in ways that never existed before. Within that backdrop of increasing and changing risk, we're not only bringing our clients better solutions, we're also working more closely with them to understand their biggest challenges, which in turn guides further innovation. Our focus on building innovative capabilities that scale across Aon to better meet our clients' needs is also highlighted by our recent appointment of Jillian Slyfield as our Chief innovation Officer. Jillian's digital experience and deep connections with Aon and across the industry position her exceptionally well to ensure that we're rapidly distributing new solutions to clients. To summarize, 2021 was a year of incredible performance and a year that positions us for growth, innovation and momentum for 2022. As we look forward, this momentum is further reinforced by global economic and societal trends and the resulting challenges and opportunities for our clients, which means that our Aon United strategy becomes even more relevant as we help clients make better decisions to protect and grow their businesses. The capability and track record that we've built gives us confidence in our ability to drive further value for our clients, colleagues, society and shareholders. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial progress in Q4 and 2021 and our long-term outlook. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered another strong quarter of performance across our key metrics to finish the year. In the quarter, we delivered 10% organic revenue growth, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth, which translated into double-digit adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth, continuing our momentum as we head into 2022. As I reflect on full year results, first, organic revenue growth was 9%, including double-digit growth in Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions. I would note that total revenue growth of 10% includes a modest favorable impact from change in FX, partially offset by the impact of certain divestitures completed within the year, most notably, the Retiree Health Care Exchange business, as we continue to shift our portfolio towards our highest growth and return opportunities. As we look to 2022, we're continuing to monitor various macroeconomic factors, including the underlying drivers of GDP; asset values, corporate revenues and employment; inflation; government stimulus; and the impacts of COVID variants, all of which impact our clients and our business. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for 2022 and over the long term. Moving to operating performance. We delivered substantial operational improvement, with adjusted operating income growth of 17% and adjusted operating margin expansion of 160 basis points to a record 30.1% margin. The investments we have made in Aon Business Services give us further confidence in our ability to expand margins, building on our track record of approximately 100 basis points average annual margin expansion over the last decade. We previously described the repatterning expenses that incurred within 2021, which have no impact on year-over-year margins. While certain expenses may move from quarter-to-quarter, we do not expect further repatterning. We expect the 2021 expense patterning to be the right quarterly patterning going forward before an expense growth. During the year, as we previously communicated, we saw revenue growth outpace expense growth and investments. While we do expect expenses to increase in 2022 due to certain factors such as increased investments in colleagues and a modest reduction of T&E, we think about growing margins over the course of the full year. We expect to deliver margin expansion in 2022 as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments and long-term growth on an ROIC basis. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth into double-digit adjusted EPS growth of 22% for the full year, building on our track record of double-digit adjusted EPS growth over the last decade. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.03 in the fourth quarter and was a favorable impact of roughly $0.23 per share for the full year. If currency will remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.16 per share or approximately $48 million decrease in operating income in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we expect noncash pension expense of approximately $11 million for full year 2022 based on current assumptions. This compares to the $21 million of noncash pension income recognized in 2021. Turning to free cash flow and capital allocation. We continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and structural uses of cash enabled by Aon Business Services. In 2021, free cash flow decreased 23% to $2 billion, reflecting strong revenue growth, margin expansion and improvements in working capital, which were offset by $1 billion termination fee payment and other related costs. I'd observe that excluding the $1 billion termination fee payment, free cash flow grew $400 million or approximately 15% from $2.6 billion in 2020. Our outlook for free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond remains strong. Given this outlook, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation as we believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the approximately $2 billion of share repurchase in the quarter and $3.5 billion of share repurchase in 2021. Over the last decade, we've repurchased over one third of our total shares outstanding on a net basis. In 2022, we expect to return to more normalized levels of CapEx as we invest in technology and smart working. We expect an investment of $180 million to $200 million. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments on a disciplined return on capital basis. We also expect to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our M&A pipeline is focused on our highest priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We continue to assess all capital allocation decisions and manage our portfolio on a return on capital basis. We ended 2021 with a return on capital of 27.4%, an increase of more than 1,500 basis points over the last decade. Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In addition, we issued $500 million of senior notes in Q4. As we said before, growth in EBITDA, combined with improvements in our year-end pension and lease liability balances, increases the capacity we have to issue incremental debt while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. Our net unfunded -- funded pension balance improved by nearly $500 million in 2021, reflecting continued progress and a result of the steps we've taken over the last decade to derisk this liability and reduce volatility. This reduction in volatility is significant for many of our clients, who still have pension obligations on their balance sheets. Current market conditions and funding status are giving many clients a chance to reduce the risk of future volatility related to funding status or regulatory changes. Our retirement team's insight and analytics in this space can help our clients access new capital to efficiently reduce their risk, often with a partial pension risk transfer, creating a long-term opportunity for us to help our clients manage their balance sheet risk effectively. In summary, 2021 was another year of strong top and bottom line performance, driven by the strength of our Aon United Strategy and Aon Business Services. We returned nearly $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends in 2021. The success we achieved this year provides continued momentum as we head into 2022. We believe our disciplined approach to return on invested capital, combined with expected long-term free cash flow growth, will unlock substantial shareholder value creation over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for any questions. [Operator Instructions] Looks like our first question will come from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question goes back to some of Christa's comments on -- you guys mentioned investing organically and inorganically over the coming year. So I was just trying to get a sense of the increase in expenses that you expect in '22. And if you have a thought on how the margin expansion could trend relative to 100 basis point average you mentioned over the past decade. Thank you.
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Elyse. As we stated previously, our goal is to grow margins each and every year, including in 2022. And we expect 2022 margins to be driven by accelerating revenue growth; portfolio mix shift to higher-growth, higher-margin businesses; and leverage from Aon Business Services. You've seen our track record, as you mentioned, of driving 100 basis points of margin expansion a year over the past decade, with some years a little more and some years a little less. We did deliver above-average margin expansion of 160 basis points in 2021. And there will always be lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter, which we did see this year, in terms of the timing of investment and discretionary expenses. So are we going to expand margins in 2022? Absolutely. And as we look to 2022, we also expect investments in colleagues, some ongoing reduction of T&E and investments in long-term growth. So we expect to drive margin expansion, net of investments, over the course of the full year.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then on the capital side, you guys bought back $2 billion, a pretty robust number in the fourth quarter. And if you think about going forward -- I know you guys don't provide guidance on buybacks. But is the right way to think about the potential level of capital return -- thinking about expectations for free cash flow as well as incremental leverage that you guys could have as your EBITDA growth, can you just help us think about the capital firepower you have in '22 and beyond?
Christa Davies: Absolutely. And look, we do expect double-digit free cash flow growth for the foreseeable future. So we have a substantial cash flow generation capacity, and we're in a really strong capital position. And so you're right, Elyse, the first starting point is expectations for free cash flow, which is double-digit over the long-term and incremental debt capacity. So as EBITDA grows, you should expect us to add debt, keeping our leverage ratios in line with our current investment-grade ratings. And then what we would say is we continue to follow a very disciplined return-on-capital approach to allocate that capital. And you saw that with share buybacks remaining the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon, $3.5 billion repurchased in 2021 and $2 billion in Q4, giving you a sense of how undervalued we think the stock currently is. But in addition to investing in share buyback, Elyse, we have a substantial M&A pipeline, and we expect to do M&A during 2022 in areas of high growth but high demand from clients. We also expect to invest organically in our colleagues, whether it's in technology to scale innovation across the globe. And so we're really excited about the $4 billion of capital return to shareholders in 2021. And we're also really pleased with the return on capital of 27.4% in 2021, an increase of over 1,500 basis points over the last 10 years.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Charlie Lederer: Hey, good morning. This is Charlie on for Mike. So Aon has been ahead of the curve building collaborative workplaces via less real estate. Does Aon expect to undergo any cost-cutting measures similar to some peers who have announced for more expense saving initiatives?
Greg Case: We'd start, I think, with -- our entire design, our entire approach is really around, as it always is, around client delivering, which we're trying to accomplish, supporting our colleagues to do that. So we will, first and foremost, really optimize around that approach and that perspective. And we've done, as you've described, a number of innovative things to sort of reinforce that. It's actually worked exceptionally well on the client side and for our colleagues as well. So you'll continue to see us do that. The outgrowth on the expense side will be what it will be. We'll make investments, as Christa just described, on a return on invested capital basis, and that's actually worked exceptionally well for us. And where there's opportunities to create optimization, we'll do that. Where there's opportunities to invest to create a better outcome for clients and colleagues, we'll do that. So that's really how we thought about it, and it's worked exceptionally well for us, especially as the environments continue to evolve.
Charlie Lederer: Okay. Great. And then you noted in your slide deck that exposures in pricing on the P&C side were modestly positive. Can you talk to us about what you're seeing in terms of momentum there? And whether you have an outlook on the P&C pricing environment for '22?
Greg Case: Go ahead, Eric.
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg. Thanks. Listen, I would say -- and I think I've said this on a couple of these calls, the pricing environment really is just one factor. You also have to look at exposure growth and the like. And listen, our role in this, when we work with our clients, is really about, first, how they do risk identification, risk management. So there's a lot that they do that doesn't go into the market. And then, ultimately, they're also financed, right? So what can they do on their own balance sheets and how can they protect themselves using their own resources? But when they get to a point where they actually want to do risk transfer, they have a number of tools at their ability. They look at retentions, they look at coinsurance, they look at deductibles, they look at terms and conditions, they look at limits, all these areas. In fact -- and we try and bring all of our insight, our data and analytics to them to help them make those best choices. And so when you see discussions around market rates, it's different than what clients actually buy. So it's not a direct line from the carrier, who may say the market's going up, the market's going down, versus what they do for their own portfolio.
Charlie Lederer: Okay, Thank you..
Operator: Next, we'll go to Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Paul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for the call, everyone. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more on the relationship between organic growth and margin expansion over time. The rule of thumb in the industry has been sort of 3% to 4% organic growth, where most brokers allows for -- or margin expansion. But there's been some folks have been talking maybe that, because of the pandemic, that relationship has been broken down, and I really wanted to see what your thoughts there on.
Greg Case: Well, the top line, a couple of things. First, when you think, overall, about what we've said around organic, we've continued to improve that profile, strengthen that profile as we serve clients, we believe, more and more effectively over time against their demands, which are changing and increasing all the ways we've described. And you've seen us kind of go to mid-single-digit or greater, and we see that opportunity obviously achieved in 2021. We see that opportunity in 2022 and beyond, again, serving existing demand that's out there, but also net new demand, new addressable markets in terms of what we're trying to accomplish in doing. I would just also observe -- and Christa described very well our perspectives on margin and what we're able to accomplish. If you think about it over the last 10 years, there's kind of a variety of different growth environments. We've achieved margin expansion and fully expect to do that. But Eric, anything you would add to that?
Eric Andersen: Greg, I would say there's a number of areas where we continue to drive growth and how we've built our strategy around trying to take advantage to bring that value to clients. You've got what we do today, how do we connect it globally, how do we make sure we're bringing new solutions within our existing business. And then areas where we find growth, where we're actually connecting the different capabilities that we have across what is historically been business units, where you might free up insight that sits inside of a reinsurance business and bring it to corporate clients, or how you bring human capital capability to match with our directors' and officers' capability on the risk side. So how you bring those new -- how you bring existing capabilities together in new ways to solve clients' problems. And then you've obviously got the net new growth that we're so focused on, whether it's cyber, where it's no longer just an insurance policy. You need to bring risk mitigation, risk identification, new skills to be able to provide real value to clients. Certainly, climate, how you drive better insight to give our clients an opportunity to try and manage today the issues that they're facing with climate while also investing in the future to provide new opportunities to help manage those risks. So there are issues that are happening that would be -- have been considered horizon risks that are today on everybody's front door, as we've said in the past, but also how we use our existing capabilities in new ways to drive better outcomes for clients. So we see an opportunity for growth certainly today and in the future.
Paul Newsome: Great. My second question, I'd like to ask about the M&A environment for the industry. It seems like we continue to hear lots of comments that private equity is interested in, in just about everything brokerage. And there seems to be just an endless supply of new roll-up companies, new probably roll-up companies. But it's hard to be outside in the know if that environment really is getting a lot more competitive and valuations are arising, or if it's more of a stable view. What's your take on the current environment?
Christa Davies: So Paul, one of the things we do is we look at -- we start from client need, and we then build our M&A pipelines around the highest growth, highest margin, highest return on capital opportunities, which are really aligned with the biggest areas of client needs, whether that's health and associated benefits, whether that's delegated investment management, whether that's data analytics. And so a lot of the areas that we're actually focused in, we're actually building relationship with companies well before they go through a process. So we're not actually competing with others. And so we're building relationships with companies in areas like cyber, in areas like intellectual property, in a lot of data analytic-intensive businesses, which we're really thrilled to be bringing that capability into Aon. And we expect to do a lot more of that in 2022.
Paul Newsome: Okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Actually, it's really one question that I have here. If I look at the actual common shares outstanding, I think you ended the year with 215 million, just under -- another 2 million of the dilutive equivalents. And yet you called out, at the beginning of first period or first quarter '22, a diluted share count of 224 million, almost. Can you maybe provide some color as to why that share count will be going up?
Christa Davies: So we have actual shares outstanding in Q4 2021 of 221.4 million. And then we have a few diluted shares, which get you to 223.7 million is the estimated Q1 2022 diluted shares.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. So that's apples to oranges. Okay. And maybe could you just remind me the stock-based compensation, does that flow into adjusted EPS?
Christa Davies: Yes, of course. So when you issue shares, you increased the share count related to stock-based compensation. And so if you think about the actual shares issued each year for the last couple of years, it's been going down substantially, while the dollar amounts of stock we issue has been remained the same. So we've been very disciplined about the granting amount we're giving out. But obviously, as the stock price increases, the dilutive impact decreases. So in 2021, as an example, we issued 1.7 million shares.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So just I think there were a lot of questions about just -- or concerns about the fallout from the Willis deal. And based on your organic growth, it doesn't seem to be impacted a lot. But if you could just talk about that? And then relatedly, it seems like if I look at your expenses, the comp and benefits line is the only one that's actually up from a couple of years ago. All the other ones are down. So not sure if you're having to pay a little bit more to retain talent, whether because of inflation or just because of the deal breaking up?
Greg Case: Jimmy, I appreciate the question, both of them, in fact. Let's start with the first one. And when you consider and you think about our ability to maintain momentum over '22, '23, '24 and, really, over time -- and with the final momentum, by the way, because we'll be very specific as grow revenue, improve margins and grow free cash flow double digits, we believe the opportunity for Aon is very strong, in fact, unique at this point in time. And we'd start -- I think, Jimmy, just to answer your question on sort of where we're going in our future, start with our current position and our financial performance. You saw at 9% organic; margin at 30%; free cash flow, double digit; more important, colleague engagement, 80%. Voluntary attrition, by the way, is below pre-COVID levels. And then client need, as Eric was describing, as high and getting higher, but it's also evolving. And so if you think about this, Jimmy, and say, look, the momentum we have going into 2022 is exceptional, and it really is on all these fronts: financial performance colleagues and client needs. But most important, as you ask the question, you get behind what's driving that? And the actions that drove this performance are the exact same actions that build momentum, and it really is the reasons we performed now and why we're going to continue to perform in '22,'23 and '24. And it's really built on the decade of work on Aon United and especially the continued refinement and amplification over the last six months. And this is on the blueprint we've talked about before and around Aon Business Services, what we're doing on innovation, a network called Delivering Aon United, very, very systematic around the globe and our people leadership. Really, the operating model we've got in Aon United is a lot. Maybe, Eric, I'll ask him to talk about that. Our brand and talent all fit together, and it really is an amplification of the strategy we've had. And the final point I'd say on this in terms of go forward, as you think about client demand in all traditional areas, they're requiring more and more capability. But this mix, this approach, the need they have, requires a more integrated approach. And wow, who would have known that Aon United, while compelling for the last 10 years, becomes more compelling in a post-COVID world, and clients are really thinking about, well, ultimately, more than ever before. And then finally, the colleague opportunity and career path in the context of this is more exciting. It's more compelling. And if you think about it, we're getting to make a difference in all these areas that matter for clients, then that means it's a better career path. It's a greater opportunity for development and more wealth creation for them. And that's why we would say, look, we are fortunate. We believe Aon's positioned to win now and in the future, and we've got really strong momentum around it. So I know we've got two questions there. I just want to stay on the first one. But Eric, anything else you'd add to that first piece around just where we're going?
Eric Andersen: Yeah, Greg, I think you covered it really well. I think the client demand question we talked about a few minutes ago. But as we work with the clients on their risk today and help plan around the risk of the future, it really is an opportunity for us to show the value of our operating model. So we can bring the capabilities of our firm to a client in the way that they want to use it and provide the insight that looks at a risk holistically, not just as an insurance risk, not just as a talent risk, but really pull all of it together at one point. And you see that in the resilience work that's being done out of our human capital and risk teams together. You see that in reinsurance risk, a couple of those different examples we talked about. But the operating model, I think, provides us with a competitive advantage that is different from what you see in the marketplace, connecting globally by using our ability to talk to clients' segments with industry backgrounds, really understanding their issues and then bringing that capability. Anybody can say it. It is absolutely critical to do it to be able to meet these needs of the future, but also having an Aon Business Services as the backbone of the firm, where we're able to leverage the data and analytics, be able to leverage our scale, provide the level of service that clients are looking for in a way that drives efficiency that allows us to invest back in the talent that you need, the new channel that you need to draw into a firm to be able to handle issues like cyber, like climate, like resilience and those types. So we feel really good that the model that we've put in place really does give us an ability to meet those needs going forward.
Christa Davies: And then on your comp and benefits question, I think you said expenses are going up. We are absolutely investing in our colleagues. We're investing in our current colleagues, in talent and development, in wealth creation and in hiring great new talents to serve unmet client needs. And we're excited about being able to continue to do that into 2022 as well as continue to invest in growth areas across our business in the context of driving margin expansion for the full year.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And how do you think about inflation affecting your business? Obviously, to the extent the premiums go up, that helps you. But are you seeing evidence of wage inflation as well? First, if you could just comment on the positive and negative of the pickup in inflation?
Christa Davies: Yes. We do see wage inflation in our business. We saw that in Q3. We expect that to continue into 2022. But what we would say is, while we continue to invest in our colleagues, which we think is terrific, we expect to offset that with efficiencies driven by Aon Business Services at scale. And so that offset and continued sort of efficiency there allows us to continue to drive margin expansion. One of the other macro things I might add, just while you're on inflation, is interest rates. So if interest rates were to continue to rise, that is a very positive dot for us in 3 key ways: fiduciary investment income increases, every 100 basis points in short-term interest rates, there's an increase of $60 million top line and bottom line for Aon; the second is pension liability comes down, and then the third, which you may think is a negative, but is not, interest expense and our entire debt portfolio has fixed interest, fixed rate interest, so there's no impact on debt. So inflation, we do expect, longer term, to be a positive for our business. Short term, there's sort of a wage inflation impact for sure. Interest rates is positive on 3 fronts. So we do think the macro environment is very positive for our business.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: And for our last question, we'll go to the line of Adam Klauber from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Adam Klauber: Good morning, thanks. Historically, you've been able to increase the margin in part. I think you said you focused on high-growth, higher-margin businesses from a business mix perspective, but also you divest historically low-growth, lower-margin businesses. So on the second part, as we look at 2022, 2023, is there still a fair amount of lower growth or margin parts of the business that you could divest?
Christa Davies: I mean what we would say is we continue to manage the portfolio actively and continue to invest in higher revenue growth, higher-margin businesses. We will continue to divest lower revenue growth, lower-margin, low return on capital businesses. I think there's fewer of them left in the portfolio. So you saw us do that with the Retiree Health Care Exchange business in Q4, but there's also a huge opportunity with Aon Business Services to invest and prove the efficiency and therefore, increase the margins of the existing businesses to help them scale globally in much more efficient ways and to scale innovation in more ways. So yes, we'll continue to be an active manager portfolio, but Aon Business Services is probably a much bigger lever for us in driving margin expansion going forward.
Greg Case: Kind of this is also a very dynamic conversation. Every year, every situation evolves over time. And it's led to a 30% margin, which we believe, as Christa described very clearly, with real, real upside over time as we move through that. But also, if you could call out return on invested capital, this process has led to 27% in change return on invested capital, which is really a phenomenal outcome in terms of sort of what it's been able to do. So it served us well. And businesses that were in the performing category 2 or 3 years ago, we have to continue to improve, and we're looking for ways to do that. So this is really not just about the static but about the dynamic and how it evolves over time. And that the process that Chris and the team has set up has really served us well. I think because there's probably like more like on the return on invested capital side, almost like 1,500 basis points over the last 10 years, surpassing even what we've done on margin.
Christa Davies: Okay. And then just one follow-up. On the Health Solutions business, you did quite well this year. From what I understand, that business has been impacted in that business across the market, has been impacted by some HR managers being very, very busy during COVID and not always having the time to be more offensive, do more discretionary projects. Are you seeing sort of that macro environment beginning to turn? Are HR managers getting more engaged, what they do more for the workforces as we go into 2022?
Greg Case: Adam, we really are -- the activity has been -- has done dramatic and this continues to increase. And whether it results in sort of revenue now or revenue in the future, the opportunity to work with people leaders and our clients around the world, it's just exceptional. And as you highlight, the demand is tremendous, not just for the sort of literally the here and now and what you do day-to-day to support employees, but also as you think about resilience, all things workforce and talent. So we love the space overall from a talent and a health standpoint. While it also ties into what's going on, on the retirement side, and I think helping employees really be more effective as leaders, as humans, in terms of what they do every day beyond just a specific benefit line. So we're seeing - we see tremendous opportunity on the health side everywhere around the world, not just in the US. And as Eric described before, it connects with demand in other areas that touch employees, like retirement and all aspects of that.
Eric Andersen: Greg, maybe one just quick comment. I think the -- when we talk about our own colleagues as the whole person, but it's not just the professional side, but certainly the well-being side, that absolutely is playing out right now with all of our clients. There's also a desire to understand, on a global basis, what their benefit programs look like, how you harmonize those. And this global benefit strategy that corporations are doing really is designed to free up talent, to be able to move talent across borders to meet opportunities. And so that is a building part of what a human resource person is looking at. And I think it also fits into the talent piece of trying to use their talent, where they're best able to drive value for the company, but also for the individual or career opportunities as well.
Adam Klauber: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: Thanks very much. I just want to say, on behalf of Christa, Eric and I, thanks very much for joining this quarter and look forward to our discussion next time. Take care.
Operator: That concludes the Aon plc's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call. Thank you for joining, and have a great rest of your day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-29 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I would like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.  It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2021 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We want to begin by thanking our 50,000 colleagues. 2021 continues to be a remarkable year. And as a result of our colleagues' hard work, dedication and perseverance, we've delivered outstanding results in Q3 and year-to-date. This performance is an extraordinary accomplishment and a direct result of their efforts, working together as one firm to bring the best of Aon to clients. We're also proud to report that our client feedback continues to be outstanding as net promoter scores are at a five-year high. Additionally, Aon's colleague engagement is at the highest levels we've seen over the past decade, consistent with top quartile employers. This client feedback and colleague engagement are directly reflected in our firm's sustained momentum and financial performance. In deep appreciation for all that our colleagues do for our clients and our firm, we were excited to establish in Q3 the Aon United growth ownership plan. This unique program rewards every colleague with a stock-based award to share in the current and future success of our firm, and we're thrilled to recognize and support our colleagues in this way. Overall, as we reflect on Q3 and the first nine months of 2021, our momentum, defined by client delivery, colleague engagement and financial results, is exceptional, even more promising as what we see in the opportunity ahead. Our conversations with clients reinforce substantial and growing unmet demand to support them in making better decisions to protect and grow their businesses in an increasingly volatile world. This opportunity to create new markets to serve our clients is the catalyst for our innovation agenda and a source of greater momentum in our business. Focusing on financial performance in Q3, our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, including 12% organic revenue growth. Notably, our strongest growth in over a decade for two quarters in a row, driven by mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from every solution line, highlighted by particular strength in health and commercial risk at 16% and 30%, respectively and adjusted EPS growth of 14%. Year-to-date, our 9% organic revenue growth reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic growth from three of our four solution lines. Our Aon United strategy is delivering significant momentum in every solution line, with net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. We also saw double-digit growth for the second consecutive quarter in the more discretionary portions of our business, such as transaction liability, human capital and project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth and margin expansion in the full year 2021, 2022 and over the long term as we continue to win share in our core business and execute to further expand our total addressable market. As we move forward, we continue to be guided by our Aon United Blueprint, to ensure we're operating as a fully integrated global team capable of delivering the best of our firm in every local market. Today, we'd like to highlight how the core tenets of our blueprint drive momentum and deliver greater future opportunity. Specifically, how delivering Aon United is enabling core new business generation and fueling stronger retention. How Aon Business Services is building capability for colleagues and translating into better service for clients. Our ongoing focus on innovation at scale is accelerating the development of new solutions to serve unmet demand, and our commitment to inclusive people leadership has resulted in the highest level of engagement and retention in over a decade. First, executing Aon United is delivering net new business generation and ongoing strong retention by continuing to engage clients across all their needs with the entirety of our firm. This strategy has been built over many years and enables extraordinary solutions for clients, resulting in Aon winning more, growing our book of business with new and existing clients and, in turn, delivering exceptional results to shareholders. Second. We've invested heavily in Aon Business Services, or ABS, over the past five years, which now represents the core operating platform that spans the entirety of the firm. ABS Centers of Excellence have and will continue to grow margins by driving efficiencies across all solution lines. Equally important, ABS capability enables us to improve client service delivery and scale innovation globally much faster, driving higher organic growth. The ABS model is redefining what we're capable of delivering to clients and improving the way we work. Third, we continue to accelerate innovation at scale. AON is delivering innovative solutions to our clients by helping them navigate new forms of volatility, build resilient workforces, access new forms of capital and address the underserved through digital solutions, all of which substantially grow our total addressable market. This has been demonstrated, for example, intellectual property back financing, a first of its kind option created and enabled by Aon's IP solutions team. Given the intellectual property represents 80-plus percent of the value of the S&P 500, we believe the entire IP category has the potential to be a $100 billion market over time. Other categories that represent new addressable markets in the tens of billions include cyber, climate, supply chain and digital client solutions, led by our exceptional team at CoverWallet. Fundamentally, this opportunity to serve substantial new addressable markets is driven by client demand. At Aon, we relentlessly focused on the voice of the client, and we're hearing consistent client feedback about the need to make better decisions around long tail risks. For example, we're currently getting this guidance from the almost 3,500 clients that are currently participating in our regional Aon Insight series. And it's also being reinforced by two pieces of proprietary research that we recently released. Every two years, Aon conducts our global risk management survey, and the latest report released three days ago was informed by insights from more than 2,300 clients across 16 industries spanning public and private organizations from 60 countries around the world. With more emphasis and reliance on technology, cyber risk top the list as the number one current and predicted future risk globally. It's highest rank since the inception of survey. The top 10 risks also reflect the impact COVID has had on organizations as they needed to navigate volatility with better and faster decisions. We're seeing organizations shift focus from event-based to impact-based risk assessments, reflecting the shift in mindset following the systemic impact of the pandemic. Aon also recently released results of a survey focused on 800 C-suite leaders and senior executives in the U.S., EU, UK and Canada to understand how organizations are preparing for and responding to the current environment. We found that, today, senior leaders are more astutely risk aware than ever before, but remain confident to take on calculated risks and investments that build resiliency of their companies. As we stated before, the approach to risk strategy has shifted from being generally defensive and risk averse to more opportunistic, taking a holistic, integrated view as they seek solutions to address these challenges. There's great respect to the need to defend their businesses, but that's accompanied by a desire to find solutions that help them win, that the IP financing example highlights. In this environment, we're uniquely positioned to deliver data-driven insights to help our clients make better decisions that grow their businesses. Fourth and finally, we continue to see tremendous impact of our commitment to inclusive people leadership. Voluntary attrition is down substantially versus our 2019 baseline our quarterly pulse of colleagues' shows that we continue to enjoy all-time high engagement levels. Many examples highlight our talent focus and priority, including our commitment on our entrepreneurship programs and a $30 million investment to create 10,000 new roles in the apprenticeship community. Our investment in talent development has over 14,000 Aon colleagues around the world have participated in training programs in the last nine months alone, and the announcement of the Ann United growth ownership plan. In summary, our global Aon team delivered the best third quarter results in over a decade. Our United Blueprint, powered by our capability in Aon Business Services, combined with significant investment in new and growing categories of addressable client demand, reinforces the momentum we have today and offer even greater potential over the next few years. The result is clients that are better informed, better advised and equipped to make better decisions. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first nine months of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth, building on our momentum as we head into the last quarter of the year. As I further reflect on our performance year-to-date, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 12% in the third quarter and 9% year-to-date, our strongest organic revenue growth in over a decade. We saw strong global macroeconomic conditions in the quarter, but we continue to assess the refactors as we have since the beginning of the pandemic. Those factors are the virus and vaccine rollout, including the potential impacts of new variants, government stimulus and overall GDP growth. These macroeconomic conditions do impact our clients in various areas of our business. Considering the current outlook for these factors, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021, 2022 and over the long term. I would also note that total reported revenue was up 13% in Q3 and 12% year-to-date, including the favorable impact from changes in FX rates driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Moving to operating performance. First, I want to speak to the impact of our previously communicated refunding expenses as compared to COVID-impacted expense in 2020, which I'll describe before any 2021 growth. As we've described, the timing of expenses is changing year-over-year, such that $65 million of expenses moved into Q3 from Q4. This impact is due to the actions we took allotted in 2020 as we reduced discretionary expenses to be prepared for the impact of COVID-19 and potential macroeconomic distress. In Q3, this re-patterning negatively impacted margins by approximately 240 basis points, resulting in Q3 operating margin contraction of 30 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have expanded by 210 basis points in Q3 and 240 basis points year-to-date. A second key factor impacting adjusted margins has been the relative speed of revenue growth and investment. In Q3, excluding the impact of the rebating, our strong organic revenue growth significantly outpaced expense growth similar to Q2. We continue to evaluate investments using our return on invested capital framework in the areas of talent, and business services and innovation to enable long-term growth. We expect that these areas of investment will continue to ramp up significantly during Q4. In addition, we anticipate continued resumption of T&E and modest increases in real estate as more colleagues return to the office. Collectively, the headwind from [expensary] patterning and tailwind from slower investment as compared to revenue growth were the main factors driving 30 basis points of margin contraction in Q3 and 20 basis points of margin expansion year-to-date. Looking forward, as we've said historically, we expect to deliver full year margin expansion for 2021 and over the long term. Turning back to the results in the quarter. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 14% in Q3 and 16% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.02 per share in Q3 and $0.24 per share year-to-date. If currencies remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an insignificant impact in Q4. Excluding the costs associated with the termination of the combination with Willis Towers Watson-related costs, our performance and outlook for free cash flow in 2021 and going forward remains strong. Free cash flow decreased 40% year-to-date to $1.1 billion as strong revenue growth was offset by the $1 billion termination fee payment and other related costs. Of the total $1.363 billion of termination fee and other related costs, a pretax amount, the $1 billion termination fee was paid in Q3 and approximately 2/3 of the remaining charges will be paid in 2021, with the majority of the balance paid in 2022. We continue to expect to drive free cash flow over the long term, building on our long-term track record of 14% CAGR over the last 10 years based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural uses of cash enabled by Aon Business Services. As Greg highlighted, Aon Business Services not only drive efficiencies, but also enables revenue opportunities and innovation at scale. As an example, through our integrated vendor management system in the U.S. last year, we were able to ensure that 5% of addressable vendor spend was with diverse suppliers, which is 2x higher than the Fortune 500 average. In addition to being a key initiative for Aon as part of our overall ESG strategy, this is also a way we can have an even bigger impact on what we deliver for clients in an Aon United way. In the third quarter, we have an opportunity to engage with the biopharmaceutical clients looking to establish a supplier diversity program as part of their broader inclusion and diversity strategy. Given our demonstrated supply diversity expertise, our global spend management team and human capital colleagues came together to forge a new innovative solution based on this client's emerging need, which included establishing government structure and conducting research on peer and industry norms. Given our outlook for long-term free cash flow growth, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares for approximately $1.3 billion. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our M&A pipeline, centered around the four areas that Greg described, is focused on bringing innovative solutions to our clients' biggest challenges, delivered by the connectivity of Aon United. I would also note that on October 1, we closed the previously announced sale of our retiree exchange business to a light. In 2020, the retiree exchange generated $176 million of revenue and it is a predominantly Q4 business. Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remained confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-lettered debt maturity profile. In Q3, we issued $1 billion of senior notes as we return closer to historical leverage ratios, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. Interest expense in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $85 million, reflecting our increased debt levels. Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows. Further, I'd note that fourth quarter is our seasonally strongest quarter for free cash flow generation, and we intend to allocate this cash to our highest and best uses based on return on capital, which remains share repurchase. In summary, strong top and bottom line performance for both the quarter and year-to-date reflect continued progress and momentum as we enter the last quarter of the year. We believe our disciplined approach to return on invested capital, combined with expected long-term free cash flow growth will unlock substantial shareholder value creation over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. Now, we begin question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question now is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Ma'am, you may ask your question.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is on the ramp-up that you were talking about expenses in the fourth quarter. Christa, I think you used the word significantly when talking about that. Just trying to if you could expand on the ramp-up you're expecting from investments, T&E and real estate? And tying into that, should we expect your full year margin expansion to be at or better than your 10-year average, which I believe is around 90 basis points?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question, Elyse. As you mentioned, over the last 10 years, we've delivered 890 basis points of margin expansion for approximately 90 basis points a year for 10 years. And we will deliver full year margin expansion for the full year 2021. As I mentioned, in Q4, we will continue to invest meaningfully in talent, in Aon Business Services and in innovation to enable long-term growth. And we expect the expenses associated with these investments will ramp up during Q4 due to the terrific opportunity we see ahead. And so as I mentioned, at least, we expect full year margin expansion. We don't give specific in-year guidance for that, but we have delivered margin expansion for the last 10 years of 90 basis points a year.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And how -- any other color you can say in terms of the -- like were you guys investing in the third quarter that it's significantly -- was there some going on in the third quarter just in terms of sizing the ramp-up that maybe you see sequentially?
Christa Davies: Yes. So what I did say about Q3 is our strong revenue growth significantly outpaced our expense growth. And so, these investments are really going to increase more in Q4 than Q3.
Greg Case: And Elyse, I would just -- to reinforce, when you think about margin over time, Christa is exactly right. You think about sort of our historical performance, it's been what it's been. And we fully expect that continues in the future on margin improvement, as we cited in next year and the following years and over time. I would just highlight, though, there has been a continued increasing ability to invest in growth and build momentum in the business in very specific areas that we believe are really reacting to client need. And what they're essentially saying they've really got to -- we really need to see new solutions on. So I do want to reflect that level of increased investment. Maybe Eric, there are a couple of specific areas you might just want to highlight so Elyse gets a sense on sort of the kinds of things we're able to invest in and still maintain margin improvement?
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg. Maybe a couple of ways to answer the make the comment. One is going back to the question around T&E, we've been doing these client impact series events over the last couple of quarters, and they've drawn thousands of clients, right? And we've been able to do it virtually, which allows us to bring global capability, global speakers, global insight to any region and share best practices. I remember what our clients are thinking about around the world has been really helpful. And really one of the benefits of using the technology in a way that we're going to keep using going forward. So the historical model of doing a road show, putting people in conference rooms around city to city to city, right? Our ability to do it in two hours and talk to 4,000 clients at the same time is material. So that's just one area. Christa, I just didn't want to lose that point because it has been such a great impact for us. And then second, Greg, is we continue to see real growth opportunities in the business really in a couple of different areas, right? First, on the data and analytics area continued to invest in our digital space, our modeling and analytic capability to help clients see what's coming and understand better. You mentioned in your opening comments around C-suite people are now risk aware. And by risk aware, that means they want more information, right? And so, we need to have more analytic capability, more modeling capabilities. So we're investing there. And then you've got your traditional areas where we're seeing great growth rate, whether it's M&A services, construction, health benefits. Those areas where we really do see that need underneath the Aon United platform of integrating those teams is really it's something. So there's a lot out there. We could talk for days about it, but just to make those comments off the question.
Elyse Greenspan: And then one last one. The tax rate was on an adjusted basis, which is under 24% this quarter, so a little bit higher than where it's been trending. If you could provide any color there? And then any implications that you can share from the global minimum tab?
Christa Davies: Yes. So Elyse, thank you so much for the question. We're not going to give guidance on tax rate going forward. But if we look back historically, exclusive the impact of discrete which can be positive or negative in any one quarter, our historical underlying rate over the last four years was 18%. And what you saw in Q3 was a tax rate slightly higher with an unfavorable discrete item. And in terms of the global minimum tax, obviously, we're tracking this very closely and monitoring, et cetera, and the implementation of that has not been worked out yet. And as we learn more, we look forward to sharing with you, Elyse.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Charlie Lederer with Wolf Research. Sir, your line is open.
Charlie Lederer: I'm dialing in for Mike Zaremski this morning. A couple of questions on cash flows. Should we expect the net loss on a GAAP basis to help reduce cash tax payments over the next 12 months or so? And also you noted in the slide deck that about the $363 million that will be paid in '21. Have you disclosed how much of that has been paid to date?
Christa Davies: So maybe I'll take those in reverse order, Charlie. Thanks so much for the question. So we had $1.363 billion of expenses that were adjusted out of Q3, $1 billion in termination fee and $363 million of charges, which is at the lower end of the range we provided. We provided a $350 million to $400 million range. We paid the $1 billion termination fee in Q3, and 2/3 of the $363 million in charges will be paid by the end of 2021 and the remaining 1/3 will be paid in 2022. And then I think your first question was around sort of the free cash flow. We do expect to generate strong free cash flow this year, and we expect free cash flow, over the long term, to be growing double digits. One of the things I'd note, Charlie, is if you start with the $2.6 billion of free cash flow, straight off the GAAP cash flow statement in 2020, that's cash flow from operations less CapEx that equals $2.6 billion you can grow that double digits, Charlie, and get yourself to a good starting point for 2022 free cash flow. And then I think you're also really asking about the tax deductibility of the $1 billion, the $1.363 billion, in fact. And we have said that's a pretax number, we have not disclosed the details of the tax deductibility of it.
Charlie Lederer: Okay. And then some of your peers talked this quarter about significant rate increases in cyber insurance. Is this helping your organic growth? And can you talk about what you're seeing there, and whether there's more of a supply/demand imbalance going on now?
Greg Case: Maybe Charlie, I'll start with that. I'd love to get Eric, your comments on this. We start overall when we're asked about rate, we always come back to market impact. That's more important than anything else. Literally, how clients really endure kind of what's going on in the broader marketplace. And remember, our role in life is to help them actually model, understand analytics and all the pieces and sort of create the best set of solutions for them in the face of market impact. And we reflect prices modestly in -- a modest impact on us over the course of the quarter and the first nine months. But generally, you can pick the one-off pieces, but overall, we're looking at how to help clients manage that. But Eric, on the day to day, how would you reflect it?
Eric Andersen: Greg, I think, I would say it in that, maybe a little bit of what you said to pick up on it. The clients make decisions based on their risk appetite, budget capacity, insurance options in the marketplace, et cetera. And each product essentially has its own dynamics. Credit has its own claim trends, it has tons of conditions, retention deductibles, supply demand, which markets are competing, et cetera.  So we're coming out of probably a 24- to 36-month price increase environment. But we're seeing a deceleration across the globe on the major products. You mentioned cyber, in particular. It's important to put that in scale in terms of the size and reach of the entirety of the insurance marketplace. So it gets a lot of attention over the last couple of days I've heard as well. But the reality is, it's one product in an entire risk management portfolio that clients are managing against. And a lot of the energy that's going into cyber today is actually going into the consulting aspect of it. The risk management part or the post-event part as opposed to just the risk transfer, as the market is trying to get its right balance as to what is -- what's the right trading price, if you will, for risk transfer and what's covered in it and the like based on all the activity we've seen in ransomware and other things over the last couple of years. But keep it in context, because overall, the size and scale of what our clients are doing around the world, they're trying to make trade-offs and choices based on market conditions that have been more favorable to insurers than clients over the last couple of years. But ultimately, our role in that is to help them using our expertise, our analytics, our modeling capability to help them make those choices. But I would just say, I would keep cyber in context relative to the entirety of the marketplace.
Operator: Our next question now is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Sir, you may ask your question.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So first, I just had a question on employee retention. You've lost a number of high-profile employees during the Willis process. It doesn't seem like it's impacted your results though. So wondering if you could just talk about employee retention overall? And whether you expect a little bit of a slowdown in results? Just haven't seen that yet, but you might be expecting that over the next few quarters because of it?
Greg Case: Jimmy, let's start with the perspective. Listen, as you've heard in my opening, quite the reverse in terms of what we look at and what we see every day. Obviously, I mentioned in my opening comments, our voluntary attrition is sort of we pegged it against 2019 and we're way ahead of that baseline. So actually, we've gotten stronger over time, very, very positive. And then most important, our engagement. And we do a full survey very frequently quarterly and sometimes even monthly around where we are, and we literally have the highest engagement we've had in the last decade. And you have to understand, we're looking at -- as we think about our colleagues, better ways to help them serve clients, which means it's much more focused on their expertise and their development, their insights. And as clients achieve their goals and what they're trying to do, our colleagues go alongside them, and that creates a very unique environment, and that's what Aon is. And as a result, we're much more, as I said, focused on talent development. Some of the things I talked about in my comments referenced that. And so we just -- we feel tremendous momentum with our colleagues around the world. And that's borne out in our performance, both our top line performance and our bottom line performance, and as I said before, in our NPS scores, the Net Promoter Scores. So from our standpoint, we are in a very privileged position. We feel terrific about where we are, what our colleagues are able to deliver around the world. And as both Eric and Chris and I have all highlighted, I feel even more optimistic about what the potential holds in terms of where we are. But listen, talent is literally what we do every day, what we're focused on every day. I want to get Eric and Christa's input on this as well. Eric?
Eric Andersen: Yes. Thanks, Greg. And look, I would just say from a -- from your direct question of are we losing senior people? The answer is, you can't track it based on the snippets of the insurance industry rags that print. We feel it's great that -- we feel great about our team and feel like where we are investing for the future is critical to how we are positioning our assets. We also have something as you think about our Aon Business Services platform. It's an opportunity for us to provide professional service, consistent standards around the world, and actually leverage our innovation in a way that I don't think anyone else in our industry can do. And so as we focus our investment on talent, we're focusing on where we can grow, where we see growth opportunities. We're also focusing it to make sure we've got the depth of service teams as we do and have been building our bench over many years to make sure we can do that. So feel really great about where we are. But having that ABS platform is a game changer for us, because it actually allows us to scale our innovation, provide the level of service that our clients need and really target our growth our investments in growth in talent into areas where we can make an outsized client impact.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on the timing of expenses. You did mention and you, I think, mentioned before as well, the expense -- the shift in expenses towards 2Q and 3Q this year. As we think about expenses and margins in 2022, should that be consistent with 2021? Or would it be more consistent with pre-pandemic levels?
Christa Davies: Great question. So 2021 is the right patterning of expenses for each go-forward year, Jimmy. So you should use 2021 as your right pattening.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just lastly, I think you've obviously benefited from lower T&E spending in the near term. And I think at some point, that comes back. But as you think about your expenses, longer term, are there sort of long-term benefits from the pandemic, whether it's lower real estate footprint or less travel going forward at least through the next few years? How do you think about sort of how the pandemic affects your margin trajectory and expenses?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for asking the question, Jimmy. It's a great question. We're really focused on learning the best lessons in how we've been serving clients well over the last 18 months, bringing global expertise and teams to serve their most important issues. Via video globally, as Eric described, with our client insight series over 4,000 clients virtually. And it's creating more opportunities for colleagues to be included globally, and we're utilizing this to bring the best talent and best expertise to clients. And so for us, this is really about the future of work and how we position Aon in a new better scenario. So, serving clients with the best talent and expertise, providing employees with flexibility and ensuring that they're productive, and having a diverse and an inclusive workforce. But Eric, you're at the front end center of clients every day, what would you that here?
Eric Andersen: Yes, Christer not much other than to say, it has really provided an opportunity for us to unlock our global talent in a way that we can bring it to a client that historically was just more challenging because of logistics. When a client -- if it's a U.S.-based client and they want to talk about something that's happening in France, you just pop up the French team, and they can go direct to it and have that conversation. So historically, that would have come from the team in France to the account exec in the U.S. and would have been talked about in the third person as opposed to just unlocking the global team, and it does a couple of things for us. One, it shows the power of the global company to a client. It also makes connections among our teams in a way where they're learning firsthand as well and so can repeat that learning. So you're absolutely right on everything you said, Christa, before, but it is there's an ability for us to really see and use the global connectivity in a way that historically had just been harder to do and do it on a more frequent basis. And we have found over the last 18 months that the clients have really valued that access, being able to get right to the point of the expertise and be able to bring it and deliver it in a really easy way for the client to digest it and really build those relationships as well. We definitely are going to take those forward. That has been a real value part for us and something that we're going to bake into the model going forward.
Operator: Our next question now is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line open sir.
Meyer Shields: First user question, if I can. What are you telling your clients about the persistence of current inflation in the U.S.?
Greg Case: So overall, Meyer, in terms of -- I just want to make sure -- so just what we're counting our clients about it? Or was that the question?
Meyer Shields: Yes, pretty much just because I think the year insights are going to be tremendously valuable. I'm just wondering what point is?
Greg Case: Go ahead, Christa.
Christa Davies: Yes. I mean, may have -- this is such a great question because wage inflation is certainly real and our human capital business is hearing directly from clients about it and seeing in our compensation surveys and data where compensation increases. And compensation is averaging increases in the 1% to 2% to 12% range, depending on the role. And as a result, our teams are spending a lot of time with clients from strategies to deal with this. Areas like total rewards for the resource allocation, organizational benchmarking and readiness and the development of long-term talent strategies are really topical right now. Not surprisingly, we're seeing a lot of demand in our human capital business, and it's reflected in the double-digit growth of that business we've seen over the course of this year.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That makes sense. Does it go beyond compensation-related inflation?
Christa Davies: That's the main area. We're seeing it in the labor area. Are there other areas you're thinking about there?
Meyer Shields: The general people are calling on financial inflation to sort of be all items CPI?
Christa Davies: Yes. I mean we're certainly -- I mean one of the things we would say more broadly Meyer is, inflation is a positive thing for Aon's business overall. If you think about it, you are insuring assets and whether the assets are corporate revenues or employment levels or commercial property assets, inflation is generally a tailwind for our business.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. And then if I can follow up. With regard to the stock ownership plan for colleagues, are we going to see any associated stock issuance associated with that? Does that offset the share repurchases?
Greg Case: Well, again, just to start with the overall plan. I think Christa we talked to the mechanics of this. I do want to just highlight this is about -- this is -- this has been amazing. It's just been a wonderful opportunity for all of our colleagues around the world to participate and take part in the success of the firm. But may actually goes well beyond that. When you talk about financial, wellness and understanding, every colleague at Aon has a fidelity statement now every colleague at Aon actually has a piece of the firm can watch and see what happens, engage in a discussion around how this works, the mechanics of it, all the nuances of it. It's really -- it's been fantastic. And in essence, in many respects, they're getting a chance to see the firm in a way they haven't seen it before. So beyond kind of the aspect of the sort of the wealth creation aspect of it, really is the financial wellness aspect of it has been absolutely fantastic. And then obviously, in the context of what we're doing, we looked at this investment in our colleagues like we look at all investments from a return standpoint, and we thought this was a phenomenal one. And by the way, our high expectations have been exceeded. The reaction is expensed to capital.
Meyer Shields: And then maybe just from a share point of view. We obviously are issuing options as part of this. But as we think about utilizing our cash, you know we run the firm based on return on but all cash on cash returns, and our highest return on capital opportunity across Aon remains share repurchase, because we value the firm on a discounted cash flow basis if values are substantially above where we're trading today. And therefore, the return on capital share repurchase continues to be the highest investment opportunity across Aon. And so we're investing in share repurchase because of the return, not to offset dilution.
Operator: Our next question now is from Weston Bloomer from UBS. Sir, your line is open.
Weston Bloomer: My first question is on the investment in talent and what that could potentially mean for organic growth, more specifically just in the second half of the year because it looks like you'll probably come off a difficult comp in second half 2022. So more curious, as you bring on new talent historically, what have you seen in terms of a ramp up in terms of getting the full efficiency or your broader expectations there?
Greg Case: Well, maybe I'll start just broad view. And again, well, all three of us can comment on this. We set back -- essentially, we talked about mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth across all of our solution lines. And that's where we are, and that's where we have achieved and continue to achieve, and that's we're anticipating for next year, or the year after, in the coming years. So look for that, that's the benchmark in terms of where we are. We really don't look at it the same way as maybe I'll just describe it this idea of quarter-to-quarter at of course and get a return. We really look at overall how we support our colleagues, the talent strategy of our firm. How we both bring them in and develop them, but also how we develop our current set of colleagues who come in and are part of Aon over time. And that's sort of new hires, but it's also, I think about our apprenticeship program. Our apprentice program has been an amazing investment and opportunity over the last number of years. we started it in 2017 as an example. In Chicago, we now have 15 employers engaged in the apprenticeship network with 1,000 of furnaces in Chicago. We made this investment across North America. We've copied what's been done across Europe. We've been recognized, even fortunate to recognize sort of what we've done in terms of sort of the impact this is going to have. And all I'm trying to highlight what's on this topic of talent, it's central day. And we developed it in a very specific way. I talked about 14,000 Aon colleagues in the last nine months alone, really going through training programs that help our colleagues continue to evolve as professionals dealt serve clients in an environment which becomes more complex. That is the way we approach the market. on all angles and all aspects with full expectation. We're going to achieve results, mid-single digit or greater. So it's not kind of up, down or different. It's just that's what it's going to be mid-single digit or greater. And then we see opportunity to continue to expand with these new addressable markets we talked about. So that's philosophically how we think about it. It isn't kind of the ramp up, ramp down, ramp up, ramp down that others often talk about, ours is really mid-single digit or greater over time. But Eric got something from your standpoint as you think about this from the talent?
Eric Andersen: Yes. Maybe a different angle on it, too, is that when you think about Aon United model and how we actually interact with clients, essentially having a client leader who can bring all of the capability of the firm to a client, whether it's on the risk side, whether it's on the wealth side or the health side, et cetera. That model is a team-based model, right? So it's less about hiring a person and then getting an immediate return, it's really around investing in the capability so that as we interact with clients, we can bring to them either existing solutions that we have today or as the teams work together and create new solutions together, where you're matching human capital and risk or reinsurance and health to try and create new ways to unlock value. That's less about I need five new people to get five new things. It's more on how do you invest consistently over time so that you have the expertise and you have the team-based culture that allows you to deliver that capability to a client in a way that nobody else can. That's what we're after, and that's what we've been building on over the last couple of years. So as Greg said, it's less about headcount up, head count down. It's around do you have the right culture, -- Do you have the right expertise and the right planning process so that we're able to interact with a client in a way where we can deliver something no one else can. That's the plan. Christa, anything you'd add?
Christa Davies: Yes. Look, just to build on Eric's point about investments. We've invested in Aon Business Services and specialized teams. And we've engineered a firm that's capable of sustained long-term organic growth and margin expansion at any point in the cycle, as we've demonstrated over the last decade.
Weston Bloomer: Got it. That makes sense. And just as a follow-up, and I might have missed this. Did you provide a CoverWallet growth in the quarter? I think you provided double-digit last question. Curious how that's?
Greg Case: We didn't provide a specific growth callout. I just want to highlight sort of this team has been exceptional. And it really is the perfect example of what Eric and Chris had just talked about. It is looking at opportunities in digital and what we can do to help serve clients more effectively CoverWallet was just an amazing, amazing firm, and we brought them into the Aon family and together, they've made our global firm better. And hopefully, as we've invested in that capability, they become stronger over time. And so we're seeing substantial impact, not just in the -- what would have been defined as the core business they came in with but really how they've helped us grow businesses around the world, and we see this as really the tip of the iceberg and what the opportunity could be driven by the team and our broader team around the world.
Operator: Thank you very much. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. We always appreciate it and look forward to our next discussion. Thanks very much.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may please go ahead and disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-30 08:30:00) =====

Greg Case: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I’m joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We want to begin by thanking our 50,000 Aon colleagues for their dedication focused on serving clients. Over the last year perhaps certainly every organization around the world has wrestled with how to best support employees, how to manage record volatility and still deliver more value to customers. At Aon, our colleagues have led through all this while also preparing for a substantial integration. What our team has accomplished is extraordinary. Today, we move forward with the benefit of all that work without a constraint of regulatory uncertainty. My remarks will cover our outstanding financial performance in Q2 and year-to-date, provide some observations on the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson and speak to our go forward plan to continue delivering great service and innovation on behalf of clients, enabling work for colleagues, and delivering excellent return to shareholders. In Q2 our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, and I'd note particular strength across the top and bottom line with 11% organic revenue growth driven by mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from every solution line, however with particular strength in commercial risk at 14%, which translated into 17% adjusted EPS growth in Q2 and 13% free cash flow growth for the first half. Our 8% organic revenue growth for the first half reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from four of our five solutions lines. Our Aon United strategy is delivering net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. We also saw double-digit growth overall in the more discretionary portions of our business, including transaction liability, human capital and project related work within commercial risk solutions. We won fantastic Aon United planning [ph] in the quarter with around cyber security organization design. Aon colleagues came together across solutions lines to address a significant, yet common client challenge. Our clients' cyber risk was increasing while their security organization faced a rapidly increasing cost retracting their retaining top talent to execute their cyber defense strategy. Colleagues from our Cyber Solutions Group within Commercial Risk and from our Rewards Practice within Human Capital combined with our unique expertise in cyber risk with best practices and benchmark on talent and compensation. The results for our client within organizational [indiscernible] solutions that align through HR and technology teams to manage their cyber risk in a more cost and efficient way. The result for Aon is a repeatable offering that helps to drive the common need for many of our clients in an area of growing risk. I would also note that we saw strong global and macroeconomic conditions in the quarter, where we continued to access three key factors as we have since the beginning of the pandemic. Those factors are the virus, and vaccine rollout, including the potential impacts of the Delta variant, as well as government stimulants and overall GDP growth. These macro conditions do affect our clients and our business. For example, we continue to see impact to our travel and events practice within Data and Analytic Services. Considering the current outlook for these factors, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021 and over the long term. Turning now to the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson. We recently announced our mutual agreement to move forward as two independent companies. On behalf of Aon, I'd like to thank our counterparts at Willis Towers Watson for their professionalism over the past 16 months since we announced the transaction. We have the utmost respect for them and have truly enjoyed getting to know the team. The combinations had significant regulatory momentum, including notably approval from the European Commission as well as approval from many jurisdictions globally through our thoroughly evaluated and vetted transaction. The exception were the United States. The demands made by the U.S. Department of Justice on our U.S. business would have stifled innovation and reduced our client serving capabilities. Meeting these demands would have significantly impacted our existing U.S. business, the potential shareholder value creation of the combination and our ability to continue to drive ongoing progress against our key financial metrics. Similarly, the path toward our mitigation was untenable because current courts appear to take us well into 2022 and we could not accept that level of delay. Ultimately, the choice was clear. We simply would never compromise colleague and client priorities to close the combination. Our decision to end the combination and pay the termination fee create certainty and clarity about how we move forward and we're confident this is the right decision for our firm, for our colleagues, our clients, and our shareholders. We move forward with energy and applied confidence in our ability to continue delivering new and innovative solutions for clients, exceptional opportunity for colleagues and financial performance for shareholders. As we look forward there are three important points that were clear when we announced the combination and are deeply and more important now. First, the world is becoming more volatile and clients need a partner capable of accelerating innovation on their behalf, to just look at the socio-economic impact of the pandemic, the rise of state sponsored cyber hacking, the floods in eastern Europe, the fires in Western America and the challenges globally from working remotely. Second, the events of the past 16 months have honed the power of AON United and our ability to work together to deliver new sources of value to clients. Over this time, we've crystalized our operating model and cemented our one term [ph] mindset. We have uncovered countless new growth, investment and efficiency opportunities, and at this point we’re better connected across our firm with all the value of this work and none of integration distraction. Third, we’re moving forward with the proven platform and are operating from a position of strength and momentum. As demonstrated by our client feedback and quality rating scores, and we’re approaching highest levels for the past decade. Our colleagues are delivering client retention and net new business generation across all solution lines, driving 8% organic revenue growth over the first half and 11% organic revenue growth this quarter, our strongest performance in almost two decades. And our Aon Business Services operating platform is digitized in our firm, improving the client experience and enabling efficiency as demonstrated by operating margin expansion and 13% free cash flow growth in the first half. Aon has never been in a better position to deliver top and bottom-line growth and build on over a decade of progress on our key financial metrics. In summary, our second quarter results demonstrate the success and momentum of our Aon United strategy. We’re operating from a position of strength and we've never been better positioned to deliver for clients, support our colleagues and generate shareholder value. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa, for her thoughts on our results, the financial impact of the termination and our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks very much Greg and good morning everyone. We delivered continued progress in both the quarter and year-to-date, including an impressive 11% organic revenue growth in Q2. Through the first half of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into double digit operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow growth, demonstrating the power of our Aon United strategy. I’d like to further reflect on our performance through the first half of the year. As Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 11% in the second quarter and 8% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021 and over the long-term. I would also note that total reported revenue was up 16% in Q2 and 12% year-to-date, including the favorable impact from changes in FX rates driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Our strong revenue growth and ongoing operational discipline contributed to adjusted operating income growth of 11% in Q2 and 14% through the first half of the year. Turning to expenses and margins, there are two key points I wanted to describe further. First, I wanted to speak to the impact of our previously communicated re-patterning of expenses as compared to COVID impact to the spend in 2020, which I’ll describe before any 2021 growth. As we communicated in Q1, the timing of expenses is changing year-over-year, such that a $135 million of expenses moved into Q2 from Q4. This impact is due to the actions we took and highlighted last year as we reduced discretionary expenses to be prepared for the potential impact of COVID-19 and potential macroeconomic distress. The $135 million is approximately 1.5% of our total 2020 expense base. In Q2, this re-patterning negatively impacted margins by approximately 470 basis points, resulting in Q2 operating margin contraction of 100 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have expanded by 370 basis points in Q2 and 250 basis points in the first half of 2021. As we said before, we expected a further $65 million to move from Q4 into Q3 for a total of $200 million of expenses moving out of Q4. A second key factor impacting margins has been the relative pace of revenue growth and investment. In Q2, excluding the impact of re-patterning, our strong revenue growth significantly outpaced expense growth. We continue to evaluate investments using our ROIC framework. While we made deliberate investments in people, operations and technology to enable long-term growth, the expenses associated with these investments were not fully incurred in Q2, and will ramp up during the second half of the year. We also anticipate some potential resumption of T&E and modest potential increase with real estate costs as more colleagues return to the office. Collectively, the headwind from expense retightening [ph] and tailwind from slow investment as compared to growth, were the main factors driving our 100 basis points of margin contraction in Q2 and the 40 basis points of margin expansion in the first half of 2021. Looking forward as we've said historically, we expected to deliver full margin expansion for 2021 and over the long-term. Turning back to the results in the quarter, we translated strong operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 17% in Q2, and 16% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.04 in Q2 and $0.22 year-to-date. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect a $0.02 per share favorable impact to Q3 and $0.01 per share favorable impact in Q4. As Greg mentioned, Aon Willis Towers Watson mutually agreed to terminate our business combination agreements and move forward immediately as two independent firms. In accordance to the business combination agreement, we have paid the $1 billion termination fee to Willis Towers Watson. With respect to the termination fee, our U.S. businesses were the primary focus of the Department of Justice challenge, and we paid this fee to defend that business from additional remedy divestitures that are essential to our ability to serve clients as well as the continuing delay and uncertainty in completing the combination. As part of the termination, we also expect to incur approximately $350 million to $400 million of additional charges in Q3 related to transaction costs and compensation expenses, as well as a small number of actions related to further step on our Aon United operating model. These charges are related to cost to terminate and close the combination, including related divestitures. They will all be incurred in Q3 as part of a clean break with Willis Towers Watson. Given the outstanding work our colleagues have done over the last past 16 months, we've taken steps internally to ensure our colleagues share in the growth potential of the firm going forward and this includes those who have previously offered retention bonuses in connection with combination. The majority of the cash relating to these charges we paid in Q3 and Q4. Aside from these transaction costs, we do not expect any further significant impacts from the termination and transaction on our financials going forward. Excluding the termination fee, our performance and outlook for free cash flow growth in 2021 and going forward remained strong. Free cash flow increased 13% year-to-date to $1.3 billion, driven primarily by strong operating income growth and decline in structural use of the cash. We continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long-term building on our long-term track record of 14% CAGR over the last 10 years, based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural uses of cash. As we communicated in Q1, we continue to expect CapEx for the full year to increase modestly year-over-year, as we invest in technology to drive business growth. Given our outlook for long term free cash flow growth, we expect share repurchases to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunities to the capital allocation. In the second quarter we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares for approximately $240 million. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our priority areas of investments are focused on addressing new forms of volatility like cyber, helping clients build a resilient workforce with better solutions around engagements and employee benefits, rethinking access to capital such as within intellectual property solutions, and addressing the unserved [ph] with digital solutions like CoverWallet. Our M&A pipeline is focused on bringing innovation at scale to our client's biggest challenges, delivered by the activity of Aon United. Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. Our financial profile has improved over the past 18 months, and considering our June 30 balance sheet, and the payment of the termination fee, we estimate we have $1.5 billion of additional debt capacity for discretionary use in the second half as we return to historical leverage ratios, while maintaining our current investment grade credit ratings. Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt-to-EBITDA growth. Further, I'd note that free cash flow generation in the second half is seasonally stronger than the first half, and we intend to allocate this cash to our highest and best use based on return on capital. In summary, we ended the second quarter in a position of strength as out Aon United strategy in investments in long term growth are driving strong top and bottom line performance, while the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson was not be the outcome we originally intended, the opportunity for Aon has only grown. As this will approach to return on capital combined with our expected long term free cash flow growth and increased debt opportunity provides financial flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term. With that, I’ll turn the call back to the operator, and we’d be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question in the queue is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi thanks, good morning. My first question is on buybacks. So, you pointed out that you guys typically stronger free cash flow in the second half than the first half. The last year you guys had one and a half turns in the second half free cash flow, and then you alluded to maybe an incremental $1.5 billion of additional debt that you guys could issue. So is that meant to apply that we could see around $3 billion of incremental share repurchase in the back half of this year?
Christa Davies: So Elyse we don’t give guidance on share repurchase, but what we can say is, as you mentioned, cash flow in the second half of the year is our seasonally strongest cash flow generating two quarters, Q3 and Q4. We've been very clear that we have the opportunity for additional debt of $1.5 billion in the second half of the year, and therefore we have substantial cash to invest back into the firm whether that organic investment M&A or share repurchase, I would note that we do allocate cash based on return on capital, cash on cash returns, and buyback remains our highest return on capital opportunity. Even at today's prices, it is a fantastic return on capital for shareholders, and on that basis we expect to do substantial repurchases in the second half of the year.
Elyse Greenspan: Right, and then my second question, I think you mentioned that folks that were eligible for retention came in with the transaction will be receiving some payments, I think that was the basis for the charges you're going to take in the third quarter, but can you, so I just want to confirm that? And then can you give us a sense of how the employee retention has trended, the past year has been during the pandemic, but why the merger is going on or even over the past couple of months the regulatory review, have retention levels been in line with normal expectations, just can you give us a sense of how things have been trending there?
Christa Davies: Sure. So, regarding the $350 million to $400 million of additional charges in Q3, they're really related to the transaction costs, and compensation expenses, as well as a small number of expenses related to further steps in our Aon United operating model. I would say these charges are really related to the cost of terminating though the combination as part of a clean break with Willis Towers Watson. Then in terms of the outstanding work our colleagues have done over the past 16 months, we've taken steps to ensure that our colleagues share in the growth potential of the firm going forward and that includes those who have previously offered retention bonuses in connection with combination. So with that I'll hand to Eric to talk for retention overall at Aon.
Eric Andersen: Sure, thanks Christa. And I would just say Elyse we continue to attract great people in all the key strategic areas for growth and expertise that Christa outlined in her remarks. We don't really pay too much attention to the headlines or the commentators that talk about talent, and certainly reject the premise of disruption that we've been hearing. Look, we have a great team and I'll just give you a couple of facts. Voluntary attrition continues to be excellent for us. We just did a poll survey in June and ended up with top quartile engagement scores for our colleagues. You know these trends, I think are the result of all the flexibility and connectivity and the support we've been giving to our colleagues over the last six months, not just with the Willis Towers Watson combination, but also with the pandemic. And so we feel really good about the team that we have. The bench, the development of all of our talent, and that we're really well positioned going forward. Maybe the other thing just I would add a thought on top of that, you think about it as a colleague, you're sitting across the table from clients listening to their challenges, their opportunities, where would you want to be? The firm with the capability we have, here and now what we can do, also a greater level of spend and investment and innovation with anyone in the world, and it's just been a great story that's evolved and the pandemic as I have tried to highlight in the opening comments just amplifies the importance of this around the need for innovation, planning, intellectual property, cyber, et cetera. So all these things come together to make the value proposition quite unique, but really I just want to call out our colleagues have been just magnificent over the last 16 months in every way shape or form in terms of how they've not only managed through all the different pieces around integration, but also what they've done for clients, it's just been extraordinary to see and that's showing up in multiple ways.
Christa Davies: Okay, thanks for the color.
Operator: Next question in the queue is from Suneet Kamath with Citi. You line is now open.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks good morning. I guess for Christa to start, if I think back to your guidance sort of pre-Willis Towers Watson in terms of free cash flow growth, you typically talked about double-digit growth rate. In today's deck, you just talk about free cash flow growth. So I'm just trying to figure out is there something that's different relative to what you've said in the past or do you still think double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term is what you guys are positioned to achieve?
Christa Davies: Suneet, we absolutely believe in double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term, and we're incredibly excited about the growth potential in terms of revenues, margins and the free cash flow over the long term, so nothing strange there.
Suneet Kamath: Okay and then, I did note in the second quarter free cash flow was down maybe 13% relative to the second quarter of last year. Is there anything unusual that sort of drove that?
Christa Davies: No, nothing. We would say look, you should really look at free cash flow growth over the course of the year, and we will absolutely grow free cash flow during 2021, and I would just say quarter-to-quarter there have been lumpy things. We're very excited about the free cash flow growth year-to-date at 13%.
Suneet Kamath: Okay, makes sense. And I guess maybe bigger picture question for Greg, post this experience with Willis Towers Watson, just want to ask about your thoughts on, you've mentioned transformative M&A in your deck. What are you thinking there in terms of M&A? Should we be expecting things that you do would be on the smaller side, given the past 16 months or just how you're thinking about inorganic growth?
Greg Case: Yes and Suneet, perhaps you come back to what Christa gave out just a bit ago on Elyse's question, we have -- we just got an enormously positive performance, and that's super carried through over the last 16 months that's showing up in what really is the focal point for Aon which is translating revenue into free cash flow and that ability to grow free cash flow. And with that cash really comes how we invest it and it truly comes back to return on invested capital. So we're always going to take steps that actually maximize return on invested capital with the cash on cash return, and we look to opportunities or we have tremendous organic opportunities inorganic opportunities in all shapes and sizes, and very much looking forward to sort of driving shareholder value, applying the cash in the appropriate way and we'll continue to look for all means to do that.
Christa Davies: And maybe I might just add and say look, we are incredibly excited about the cash flow growth potential of the firm, both in the second half of the year and going forward. And then obviously our ability to grow debt as EBITDA grows, we've got an enormous amount of cash to invest, and we will invest organically, inorganically with M&A and in buyback on a return on capital basis. And as I mentioned, we've actually got a number of priority areas for reinvestment really focused on meeting on that, it's the clients, addressing the volatility like cyber, helping clients build a resilient workforce, rethinking access to capital and innovative new areas like intellectual property and addressing the underserved through our investments like CoverWallet. So we've got an exciting array of investments that we are continuing to invest in, and so we're really excited about the growth potential going forward.
Suneet Kamath: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Next question is from Jimmy Bhullar, with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So I had a question on just organic growth in the commercial business. And it was obviously 14% for you guys strong for most of your peers as well, and obviously comps were pretty easy, but other than comps what are sort of the main drivers of that? I think you mentioned in your release pricing was a modest positive, but just trying to assess what are some of the things that might not be sustainable because they are related either to a catch up in business activity or other things versus things that might continue at least in the near term?
Greg Case: Certainly, I will be able to start with a couple of new thoughts and Eric, can talk about the different pieces, geographies around the world where we've seen tremendous strength on strength continue to evolve. For us there was really no catch up in any way shape or form. We got back to early last year, we're in a very strong position and that just continued to build through the pandemic. As client need increased, our ability to react to clients and serve them also continued to increase, and so generally we ended up with new business generation. That new business generation really an all time highs and it continued to build, moved into the third and fourth quarter of last year, and now you see it in the first half of this year, and really for the last five quarters are real and through the forced effort on behalf of colleagues around the world on all areas, as they relate to, as related to growth. It's why we underscore and reinforce the mid-single-digit organic for the year and ongoing beyond 2021, but it really is the fundamentals, it really is how we're connecting with clients and supporting clients, how we're applying the Aon United strategy of bringing the best of our firm to clients every day and that actually has just strengthened and grown, until we really come out of the last 18 months, when you think about the chassis of Aon, the Aon United foundation is stronger than ever before. But Eric a lot is going on around the world by geography, a lot of good stories, you got thoughts?
Eric Andersen: Yes, sure. Listen, I think there's a couple things to point out. One is, we had double digit growth in commercial risk in each of our geographies around the world, so it was really a great quarter all the way around, really strong rollover, really strong retention, which really sets you up in the future for continued growth, and it was a couple things right. The core PNC business performed really well, so really pleased about that everywhere, but also the discretionary work that Greg and Christa had talked about, whether it was transaction liability, cyber, construction other project type work, all of which were performing very well, equally across the world. So we had a really solid performance everywhere and we're really excited about it obviously.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay, and then just on pricing, you mentioned a modest positive, what would seem like it would be a better than modest positive just given what we've seen -- been seeing with underwriters, but what are your -- what's the sort of color on that?
Eric Andersen: Yes, sure. It's always a great question because people always wonder why the direct carrier sort of per unit price doesn't show up and translate across to the intermediaries on the risk side. And listen, I would just say clients, clients make choices when prices move up or down, right and one of the things that we do with them and I think I've mentioned this in the past, we first help them to do identify the risks that they have, and then try and manage them without the use of risk transfer. And then as prices go up, clients finance more of it themselves if they can handle it. And then ultimately when you get to the risk transfer part of where they decide to trade the risk, they make choices there too. The amount of insurance that they buy, the coinsurance, deductibles, things they try and manage. For them the budget that they have to spend on topics like risk transfer. So it's never a direct line from what a carrier publishes as rate to what a client actually does for the risk that they're trying to transfer. And so all those areas that we're talking about, clients have a real heightened focus on during a time when pricing is increasing and they get very specific around how they try and manage it themselves or finance it themselves before they try and risk transfer it into the market.
Jimmy Bhullar: Are you're seeing more pushback from clients on price hikes, because it seems like commentary from the underwriter side is still pretty positive on what's going on?
Eric Andersen: So listen, clients certainly don't want after three years of a rising market to pay more for a similar risk, but ultimately I think what they've done is they've continued to just get more sophisticated. I think we've been able to help them with our data and analytics and insight to be able to make better choices around how they handle the risks.
Operator: Next question is from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Greg Peters: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question will just stay focused on organic. Beyond commercial risk solutions you had some very strong results in reinsurance and in health. And Greg, I think you did call out a headwind or two in data analytics. Your guidance for mid-single-digit are better going forward. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is how much of the second quarter result was a snap back and how much of it is permanent in terms of how we should think about organic going forward?
Greg Case: Greg, I appreciate the question and the thought, terrific. Listen, as we think about the growth profile, we keep coming back to this idea of the commitment around mid-single-digit or greater for the rest of the -- for the year and for 2022 and beyond. I think about it, we did four to five solution lines and we were meeting that standard in the first half and we got great trajectory. No doubt there's variants that are within the solution lines. I highlighted in data analytic services. Look our travel business is still under a tremendous amount of pressure as you would expect, but still our colleagues are fighting through that, finding opportunities, finding ways to connect with clients and you're seeing that. So for us we feel good about mid-single-digit or greater. We've made that commitment before, and there was really no snap back. As I said before the ability to connect with clients and drive growth has sustained throughout the pandemic and certainly sustained and probably even amplified into 2021. So, that's why we feel quite strong about the outlook.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it, and then Christa on the expensive repatterning, as we gradually return back to whatever the new normal looks like, when we and I know you don't like to comment on projections, but when I think about 2022, are we going to have another expense repatterning, if things get back to what the old normal was, or is what you're experiencing here in 2021 sort of the new bar, which we can go to and measure on a quarterly or quarter-over-quarter basis going forward?
Christa Davies: So it is the new basis, and we should expect extensively consistent with this pattern going forward. And so really, what I would say is, it's reflecting changes from a COVID impacted 2020 expense base. So 2020 was the unusual pattern and Greg, and 2021 we're repatterning to get back to our normal expense planning. So this is the correct performance across the year going forward.
Greg Case: That is correct. This is Greg. As Christa highlighted very well, when you think about this over the course of a year, and what we're trying to do now within quarters, exceptional performance that continues to improve.
Unidentified Analyst: That makes sense. Thanks for your answers.
Operator: Next question is from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
David Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to stick on cash flow. And I guess first, looks like, I was just wondering, do you think CapEx looked a little bit lower than I had thought? You'd still expect that to be up for the full year? And also, I think when I think about the seasonality, and second half is higher than the first half, I just wanted to confirm that that's excluding the $350 million to $400 million of termination costs and retention bonuses. So we should think, I think that would take away a lot of the seasonality, but just wanted to confirm that?
Christa Davies: Yes. So firstly, we expect very strong cash flow in the second half. And yes, it excludes the, we expect the termination expenses to be adjusted out of Q3. Having said that, we do expect free cash flow to be strong for the full year and we're extremely excited, obviously, about the 13% growth in free cash flow year-to -date. In terms of your question around CapEx, we would say that CapEx should increase modestly year-over-year, driven by investments in technology to drive long term growth. And I would say look going forward, we expect free cash flow to grow double digits over the long-term, religion by three key things, growth in operating income, declining uses of cash, and improvements in working capital. And so we're really excited about the growth in free cash flow long-term, as well as our ability to add debt as EBITDA continues to grow. So a substantial amount of cash to invest back in Aon.
David Motemaden: Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe just a question, just it definitely sounds this on the Willis merger and any sort of impact that might have on the business. I know you guys spoke about it through, in response to a previous question, but I'm hearing that it sounds like you didn't want the deal to stretch into 2022. And also, obviously there are the retention payments and some of the other termination payments. I guess, could you just maybe elaborate on if you would expect any sort of disruption going forward in the organic growth?
Greg Case: Maybe let's start, it's worth, actually just putting things in context and you think about sort of where we've come over the last 16 months. And we'll translate it directly in the growth, which will be a great story as we shown in the first half. If we take a step back in the last 16 months, the primary thesis behind the combination exceptionally strong. In fact, the pandemic has made it stronger over that period of time. Obviously, strong shareholder approval, regulatory momentum, in virtually every jurisdiction around the world. And I noted obviously, DG comp in the European Theater, and others around the world as well. And just so you understand, we reached an impasse in the U.S. Department of Justice. We could have completed the deal in a couple of ways, but we made the choice to reject what we believe were two unacceptable options. One was the remedies and we could have completed the deal through the remedy, just like we did in Europe. But it wouldn't have been the right answer for us. It simply would not have been the right answer. We roughly know what it would take, but candidly would have damaged our client serving capability as we described before, stifled innovation and as I said, you've heard Eric and Christa talk that we will never, we would never sacrifice our Aon United strategy to close the transaction. This is not going to happen and in the end, that's where we were on the revenue side. And the second option, equally unappealing was litigation. We had an exceptionally strong hand from our view, but the timeline, pushed the deal into 2022. And listen and looked like it did in every way, shape or form, also unacceptable. We're just not going to wait in a holding pattern well into 2022 to sort of have this resolved. It is just too long. So we wanted to make a choice, David, for our firm and well certainly on our terms to move forward independently and obviously, the position of strength, if you think about where we were in 2020, and now where we are now, very much a position of strength. And we're excited about how we move forward with real enthusiasm driven by our team and the strength of our Aon United strategy. So that's the rough picture in terms of sort of where we are, but we have to grow up. Eric or Christa, if you have got some more comments on?
Eric Andersen: Yes, sure Greg, maybe I'll talk a little bit about the integration planning process and how we're using that work to help propel us forward post this event. Maybe to go back a little bit, we went into the, certainly the pandemic into the Willis Towers Watson combination, in a great place. We were very strong going in, both operationally and with revenue growth. And when we started the integration management effort, we were essentially able to maintain the client momentum and continue to work on our strategy. During the last 16 months of planning, the teams really perfected our Aon operating model, the delivering Aon United Strategy, as well as our go-to-market, how do we actually pull all these teams together for the benefit of our clients. All that's going to be incorporated going forward, which will continue to build the momentum. So, I think while we came into this process in a strong position. I think we're actually coming out of it in an even stronger position.
Christa Davies: Completely agree Eric. And I would say, our financial results have strengthened, in growth, in margins, and in free cash flow. If you look at 2021, we delivered 11% growth in Q2 organically, 8% growth organically year-to-date, and 13% growth in free cash flow year-to-date, just stunning financial results in 2021, building on a really strong 2020. 1% growth organically through COVID, 100 basis point margin expansion to 28.5% and 64% growth in free cash flow to $2.6 billion, building on a decade of progress, 4% average organic growth over the last 10 years, 890 basis points in margin expansion over the last 10 years and 15% free cash flow growth each and every year over the last 10 years. So phenomenal set of financial results. So we would say our financial results have strengthened in gross margin and free cash flow. But Greg, do you just want to come back to the growth question?
Greg Case: Yes, so again, David, I just want to give you a sense of sort of what our history has been over the last 16 months to your questions. And then you kind of say, well, how does that translate into growth? I think Eric's point we think was really important. The fundamental capability actually has strengthened. We spent so much time thinking about opportunities on the growth side, on the efficiency side, on the investment side and we came up with a ton of them and we're incorporating all of those. All that then reinforced by, the Aon United strategy and the connectivity and ironically COVID created a situation where we are on WebEx and others have different, different systems, WebEx connected our firm in a way sitting across the virtual table from clients in a way that's been incredibly, incredibly powerful. And that's what's led to literally net new business growth and also growth rates with existing clients, the strongest we've ever seen. So it really puts addition does exceptionally well to continue to increase market share and take share around the world, which we've been doing and continue to do, as well as create net new and at this moment, I don't want to get away. This is not a zero sum game for us. We're winning the zero sum game, but it isn't about that. It's about net new. As we put solutions in place around cyber, intellectual property and climate, I mean, just the three we talked about a lot, and we spend a tremendous amount of time focused on those. So we're very excited about the growth prospects, that's why we talk about an integral digital grader across all our solution lines in 2021 and beyond.
David Motemaden: Great, I mean, yes, thanks so much. I really appreciate that color. It’s really helpful. And Aon it's obviously not showing up any sort of disruption. There's no evidence of that in the results, so I definitely appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is now open.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. I guess my first question is on, how do I put it, communication philosophy. Because it looks like the execution for organic growth for 2021 even single digits are higher, and noticing that this is on a year-over-year basis probably just a phenomenal operating environment with economy, hopefully coming back and sustaining rate increases. And I'm wondering whether the use of the sort of traditional language even it indicates that we shouldn't expect too much from the tailwinds.
Greg Case: Well, Meyer, I wouldn't say that and in fact, what we're trying to highlight is listen, there's still a lot of volatility out there in the world, it's moving around. We essentially have said in the face of that volatility wherever it goes. We're very confident in mid single digit or greater. By the way, not just for this year, but ongoing as a piece and then double digit free cash flow. And our view is that economic model we think about it from an investor standpoint, is extraordinary in terms of sort of what that means. And so this, what we want to do is make sure you understand we're reflecting high confidence in our ability to achieve that. And, Aon will keep pushing forward on that basis. So there's, it's not about rebound or anything else. But Christa anything else you want to say to that?
Christa Davies: The only think I would add Meyer is, there is still some macroeconomic uncertainty and there are still some areas of our business like travel events that haven't fully come back. And so, we will navigate through this, and still deliver phenomenal financial results for the year, mid single digit or greater in 2021 and going forward.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that's very helpful. Second question, I appreciate Eric’s comments on employee retention and attrition. When we look at the on a number of brokers that are out there, in I guess, reinsurance or large accounts, is there any increased competition for talent that would require higher organic growth rates for margin expansion that we've seen in the past?
Greg Case: I would just say overall, it's competitive out there. It's always competitive, as Eric highlighted very well. And then we love the model we have because the opportunity for colleagues at an individual level and literally together and that's really what we're talking about individual capabilities, but also collective greatness, collective ability to succeed is exceptional today. And that's, for us it served us exceptionally well. But there's I wouldn't say Eric could comment on this, a more or less competition and there is always been in terms of sort of what's been out there?
Eric Andersen: Yes, I agree, Greg. I mean, it's always been a very competitive business across all the risk platforms, whether it's the primary brokerage or the reinsurance brokerage. And so, yes, I think just ultimately we continue to have to bring our best each and every day to our clients with the best tools and insight and if we do that, I think we'll be fine. Christa anything you would add?
Christa Davies: Yes, and maybe on the margin point, I guess what I would say is, we can grow margins in any operating environment. You saw last year, when we produced 1% organic revenue growth, we expanded margins. And because of the investments we've made in Aon Business Services, really bringing together all of our operating sort of infrastructure in one place, centers of excellence, all the people and capabilities in one place, we're able to drive productivity benefits each year at scale. And so, we'll continue to drive margin expansion for the foreseeable future, building on the 890 basis points, the margin expansion, we drove for [indiscernible] points a year, over the each year. And so we expect to drive margin expansion in 2021 and each year thereafter, regardless of growth.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that’s perfect. Thank you so much.
Operator: Next question is from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Phil Stefano: Yes, thanks and good morning. I think that, if I heard you correctly, earlier I think you had talked about a ramp investment that's going to pick up in the near future. I guess, in my mind, the gap of growth and revenues versus underlying expenses is going to narrow. It looked in the long run this normalizes as you've talked about the expectations for margin expansion. So can you just give us a frame to think about how this looks like in the short run, in the extent to which this gap may narrow and maybe some economic sensitivity to the broader recovery?
Christa Davies: Yes, so really the point I think I was making Phil was, in Q2 we did see greater underlying margin expansion, excluding the repatterning of expenses, because growth outpaced our ability to invest in that growth and a lot of the investments, what we did invest in people and operations and technologies to drive our business, some of that was not fully incurred in Q2. So it's really a statement about Q2 specifically Phil. And really what I would say is, what you said is exactly right. Over the long-term growth and expenses to drive that growth will be aligned.
Phil Stefano: Okay, got it. And so, my thought I think, it was perfectly for my follow up. You've talked about deliberate investments in people, technology. Can you give us a little more color on what exactly that means, may be an example or two of what's driving these deliberate investments?
Christa Davies: Yes, I mean, there's a number of areas that we're investing. So maybe I'll star and Eric and Greg, you can jump in. But, as an example, we're investing a lot in technology to help deliver innovative data analytic based solutions to our clients to help them manage risk, retirement and health more effectively. So it'd be one area we're investing in, in security, because obviously the security environment and cyber have become a greater threat for colleagues and so, that is another big area of investment. The last is I'd say, we're actually continuing to hire great talent into the firm, but maybe Eric and Greg, do you want to sort of build on this?
Greg Case: Yes, one thing, one real quick, everyone is -- Eric and add some really pointed comments here. When we think about the Aon Business Services, so that platform is of course to describe the technology investment, cyber risk, this is, over the years it would have been very difficult for us to sort of create global impact of our investment, because we couldn't scale it. We can scale it now. So as Christa and the team guided, this investment is incredibly efficient in terms of how we can actually increase capability and make it real around the world. So we don't want to lose that point. It's very, very fundamental to what Aon Business Services is all about. But in addition to that these net new areas that Christa was alluding to are really exciting and this is a net new capability we're bringing in. Some of it is connected to risk, some of it is connected to just fundamental capabilities, certainly on the climate side, intellectual property side, and on cyber side. So a lot we're doing that we are very excited about in terms of the ability to help clients address issues critical to them, that heretofore haven't been addressed in the way that they needed to be, so a lot happening from that standpoint. Eric, and anything else you…?
Eric Andersen: Yes, you just gave a great overview of it Greg, but if you think about intellectual property and the new skills required there, and if you think about the new risk areas, about renewable energy, about climate modeling capabilities that we need, you mentioned cyber, and certainly in our human capital business, trying to invest in how we do ESG at scale for clients. So there's a whole lot happening on the ground. As Christa said that is supporting the growth that we're seeing, and recognizing that we need to keep investing to make sure we keep growing.
Phil Stefano: Well, thank you. Good luck.
Operator: And the last question that we have in the queue for today is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is now open.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. So, two quick questions here. First one, just curious Christa, what's the revenue impact of the sale of the retirement exchange? It looks like you're continuing for with that one?
Christa Davies: Yes. So the revenue Brian in 2020 for the retire exchange was $176 million? It is predominantly Q4 businesses, you know well.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then second question, I'm just curious, as a part of this process that you're going on with Willis Towers Watson, you'd obviously identified a lot of cost synergies and expensive potential savings from the transaction. I'm curious if you were able to identify any specifically for Aon if you can see potentially here going forward to help with cost savings and efficiencies as you went through this process?
Greg Case: Brian this, Greg. What we were alluding to and talked about before, I think back and, Eric is going to jump in on this. Eric has led this integration for the last 16 months and this has really been at the one foot level, literally as we engage and connect with our colleagues around the world, and with clients around the world and we've seen and uncovered multiple growth opportunities, investment opportunities, expense opportunities, highly available to Aon specifically and all those are going to be baked in as we move forward. This is back to the theme. We came in the 20th on March 2020 with exceptional capability, strength. And what we've done over the last 16 months around integration is fundamental improvement of our platform. What is going to be the combination combined platform, but it absolutely is applicable to Aon, but Eric, you led this, what do you think?
Eric Andersen: Yes, Greg, I think there's two buckets, right. I think on the revenue synergies, you're talking about the client value creation model that we've been working on, otherwise are delivering Aon United Strategy, about how you bring the firm together. We're talking about how we're perfecting it. That was done in the context of the integration management planning. But also on the expense side, certainly real estate strategy, technology strategy, all the areas that you would think, having a fresh look with teams that were built specifically to try and challenge the status quo and really pressure test, how can we do it better, how can we do it more efficiently? How do we leverage our Aon Business Services model in a way that we had really started during pre Willis Towers Watson combination to really accelerate how we actually use that capability. I wouldn't necessarily call that last one new. I would just call it expanding what we've been building and really getting it embedded across the firm and across the world.
Brian Meredith: Terrific, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: Thank you. I just want to say to everyone, thanks very much for being part of the discussion today. We appreciate it and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: This concludes today’s call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today’s call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2021 results, as well as having being posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2021 conference call. I’m joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. I’d like to start by acknowledging the tremendous work of our colleagues across the firm. Our team continues to find ways to get back not just normal, but even better than before and we like to call it the new better. The idea of the new better started in the second half of last year with a series of regional and local client coalitions. There are now 10 coalitions of leading companies around the world that we formed to explore the societal and economic implications of the pandemic. The group rejects the idea of accepting a suboptimal new normal and is working here to find new better. The work is ongoing and continues to offer meaningful insights into how leading organizations will work, travel and convene in the year ahead. And we’re translating those insights into new solutions that are designated and designed to accelerate recovery from COVID-19. For instance, we know that widespread global vaccine distribution is the key part of the solution and one that Aon is enabling. Let me describe, recognizing limitations with current supply chain solutions Aon colleagues from Commercial Risk, Reinsurance and Health Solutions collaborated with insurance, reinsurance, insure tech and supply chain industry partners to develop a groundbreaking solution that uses sensors and analytics in the transportation and storage of vaccines. The centers provide transparent real-time data and alerts if the temperature of the vaccine shipment falls outside the manufacturer’s range, potentially allowing for mitigation efforts and helping to maximize the number of doses administered to the public. It’s just another example of how we’re creating innovative solutions to move our industry and society forward. We’re also donating all 2021 revenue from the solution to an international organization working to help end the human and economic toll caused by the pandemic. Turning now to financials, our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, including 6% organic revenue growth, a very strong start to the year on top of 5% organic in Q1 2020, substantial operating margin expansion of a 170 basis points 16% EPS growth and 91% free cash flow growth. Within organic revenue, we continue to see strength in our core, driven by strong retention and net new business generation, and overall growth within more discretionary areas of revenue, with some areas coming back faster than others. Commercial Risk delivered 9% organic, an outstanding result with very strong new business growth and growth in project related work and double-digit growth in transaction liability. Reinsurance delivered 6% growth, with strong net new business in treaty and double-digit growth in facultative placements. Retirement Solutions delivered 5% growth and I would highlight strength in core retirement and double-digit growth in human capital. Health Solutions growth of 4% was driven by strength in the core offset by pressure and project work. One of the areas we’re seeing a little slower bounce back, and data and analytics continue to see pressure from the travel and events practice globally resulting in a 2% organic decline, so against the prior Q1 quarter pre-pandemic results. These results are an improvement from our Q4 earnings call outlook. During the quarter, we saw better-than-expected macroeconomic growth, which positively impacted client buying behavior. Looking forward, if macroeconomic conditions continue to be strong, we would expect mid single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021. And while our Q1 results demonstrate that our Aon United strategy is driving innovative solutions that address our client’s biggest challenges, we keep seeing signs that we must move faster. We see our clients justifiably focused on the economic impact of COVID-19, but they’re also increasingly focused on other challenges like climate change, supply chain disruption, reimagining and reconfiguring how and where work gets done, the growing health wealth gap and cyber. Our recent Cyber Risk report highlighted findings from our proprietary cyber quotient evaluation, a comprehensive assessment of Cyber Risk maturity. The 2020 data tells us that organizations across regions and industries are only maintaining a basic level of cyber readiness. Specifically, only two and five organizations report they’re prepared to navigate new exposures and only 17% report having adequate application security measures in place. In our recent Gray Swan report we looked back at 40 years of corporate crises, analyzing 300 examples that show the significant impact on shareholder value due to lack of preparedness. The total impact represents $1.2 trillion in destroyed value and in 10% of the event 50% of shareholder value was lost. These risks and challenges are exactly where we want to help our clients assess and prepare for. Another great example are human capital and commercial risk teams realize that their client in the life sciences med-tech space had not done an assessment or quantification of cyber risk for their business or products. Our team analyzed risks across infrastructure, technology, vendor and digitally enabled products and quantify potential losses or impacts as reputation business interruption or hack from their related devices. In response to this prioritized and quantified risk assessment, our clients strengthen their own security measures and change their insurance coverage, increasing their preparedness and reducing potential future volatility to their business, a topic that’s more critical than ever for companies in the life sciences industry. Looking forward, this is a process and a solution offering, that makes innovative cyber solutions more accessible to our clients in life sciences space. As we look to our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, we’re confident their insights and capabilities will be a compelling catalyst to this work. And this is just one example out of thousands where we see the potential for the pending combination with Aon and Willis Towers Watson teams to drive innovation based on forward looking analytics and insight. As we’ve brought together the executive committee that will be in place after the close of the combination, the potential is clearer than ever. We have an opportunity to be more relevant to clients at a time when they need us most. Another example, our Aon team is currently advising a client on the integration of their largest transaction to-date, a complex global merger that’s moving very quickly, colleagues from data analytics, retirement, health and benefits and human capital came together to advise our client on harmonizing their people programs, while balancing synergies and deal objectives to drive employee engagement and retention, as well as a shared vision from day one. Our client is relying on Aon to help them protect their greatest asset, their people. We know that the combination with Willis Towers Watson will enable us to bring together our combined capabilities as an each company’s client insight around health, retirement and engagement will improve and accelerate our ability to deliver projects like these for clients. In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate the continued success of our strategy and position us with momentum to drive improvement on our key metrics over the course of the year, building on the track record of progress that we’ve delivered over the past decade. The events of 2021 continue to highlight unmet need and growing demand from clients around their biggest challenges, which we know are best addressed by our one firm and United strategy. Our ability to address client needs and accelerate innovation will only get better in our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, which continues to increase our commitment and excitement to the potential of the combined firm. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financials and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg mentioned, we delivered a strong operational financial performance in the first quarter to start the year, highlighted by 6% organic revenue growth that translated into double-digit growth in operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow. Our Aon United strategy has enabled continued growth across our key financial metrics. We look forward to building on this momentum through the rest of 2021 and then our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson. As I further reflect on the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 6%, driven by ongoing strength in our core business, with an uneven recovery in our more discretionary areas. I would also note that total reported revenue was up 10%, including the favorable impact from changes in FX primarily driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus the euro. Second, we delivered strong operational improvement with operating income growth of 15% and operating margin expansion of 170 basis points to 37.4%. Stepping back, our goal is to deliver sustainable operating margin expansion over the course of a full year, as there can be volatility quarter-to-quarter given the seasonality of our business and tiny expenses including long-term investment and growth. In Q1, margin expansion was helped by two factors. First, organic revenue growth exceeded our Q4 outlook due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and polite buying behavior. Second, Q1 2020 had higher expenses in areas like T&E and investments in the business, which made for an easier comparable when compared to our expectations for the rest of 2021. Looking to the rest of 2021, we anticipate investment in the business and some potential resumption of T&E later in the year. Looking forward to closely passing of expenses for the balance of 2021, as we described last year, we reduced certain discretionary expenses at the onset of the pandemic, given the significant macroeconomic uncertainty and then returned to somewhat more normalized levels of spend in the back half of the year, as macroeconomic conditions improved and the outlook stabilized. In 2021 compared to 2020, we expect approximately $200 million less expense to be recognized in the fourth quarter, offset by approximately $135 million more expense in Q2 and $65 million more expense in Q3. Put another way, we expect $135 million of expense to move from Q4 to Q2 and $65 million of expense move from Q4 to Q3, when comparing to our expectations for the remainder of 2021 to prior year results prior to any growth occurring. This shift representing about 2% of our annual cost base is primarily due to the actions we took and highlighted last year, including the reduction of the discretionary expenses including variable compensation in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. This shift also spreads our expense base more evenly across quarters, so we still do expect the occasional variability and lumpiness in expenses. This change will have an impact on quarterly margins reducing margins in Q2 and Q3, and increasing them in Q4. However, it does not change our expectation of full year margin expansion for 2020-2021. As we stated previously, our goal is to deliver sustainable margin expansion over the course of each full year, driven by accelerating revenue growth, portfolio mix shift to higher growth higher margin businesses and leverage from Aon Business Services. Aon Business Services is focused on innovation, as well as effectiveness. Recently our Aon Business Services team saw an opportunity to improve premium accounting with a blockchain solution. The team worked as a carrier partner and the insurance industry standard setting group to design and develop a clearinghouse for premium transactions. This process has been live since the 1st of January, 2021 and has over 13,000 transactions executed. It’s already improving the speed at which arrows are identified and resolved. Overtime, we expect our major carrier partners and other brokers to join the platform. We see this as a significant opportunity to improve the client experience with higher quality and reduce inefficiencies across the industry. As with other Aon Business Services process improvements, efficiencies in this new blockchain process enable our colleagues to spend more time with clients and on high value-added activities. Turning back to the results of the quarter, we translated strong operational performance into EPS growth of 16%, as shown in our earnings material, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.18 in the quarter. If currency to remain stable at today’s rates, we would expect a $0.04 per share favorable impact in Q2, a $0.02 per share favorable impact in Q3 and a $0.01 per share favorable impact in Q4. Finally, moving to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow increased 91% to $532 million, primarily driven by strong operational improvements, a decrease in restructuring cash outlays and a decrease in CapEx. I would note that we do expect CapEx for the full year to increase modestly as we invest in technology to drive business growth. Looking forward, we expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long-term, building on our 10-year track record of 14% CAGR growth and free cash flow, including 64% growth to $2.6 billion free cash flow in 2020. We remain incredibly excited to the long-term cash flow potential of the pending combination. We make capital allocation decisions based on our ROIC framework highlighted by 50 million a share purchase in the first quarter. As a reminder, Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter for free cash flow, due primarily to incentive compensation payments. We also repaid $400 million of term debt in February. Looking forward, we expect to remain highly focused on closing and then successfully integrating our combination with Willis Towers Watson. Following that, we expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities in priority areas to service our clients unmet needs. We remain very confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In the near-term, we expect to continue to manage our leverage ratios conservatively and return to our past practice of growing debt as the EBITDA grows over the long-term. As I look towards our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, we remain incredibly excited about the potential for growth in innovative solutions for clients and the shareholder value creation opportunity. We are continuing to work collaboratively with the appropriate regulators to gain approvals and we’ve offered remedies. We continued to anticipate $800 million of cost synergies taking into account the remedies offered. We would expect to allocate any divestiture proceeds according to our ROIC framework in which share buyback continues to be our highest return investment. We are working towards the close in the first half of 2021 subject to regulatory approval. In summary, our first quarter results reflect continued progress building on a decade of momentum, driven by our Aon United strategy and underpinned by our Aon Business Services operational platform. We remain incredibly excited about closing out pending combination and beginning the integration process with Willis Towers Watson, which will continue to enable long-term shareholder value creation. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to the, Operator, and we’d be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. And our first question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your line is now open.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks and good morning. So last year you guys pulled your guidance for the merger when you pulled your Aon standalone guidance. But now that you’ve re-established guidance on a standalone basis, can you provide some thoughts on your expectations for guidance for the merger?
Greg Case: So, Suneet, appreciate it. As we’ve said before when we got together as the pandemic and so we pulled guidance overall, what we said today as we think about Aon, obviously, we’re talking about mid single-digit or greater certainly macroeconomic conditions continue -- are continue. I remind everybody that before pandemic we talked about a combined mid single-digit or greater and we planned to do need is when we -- as we complete the combination we will obviously back to you with what we expect going forward. But remember where we were when we started the process.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. And then just focusing on the expense guidance, I guess, for Aon on a standalone basis. Christa, I think, you said, you’ve call out a couple of things that are moving from quarter-to-quarter, but is there an assumed underlying kind of growth rate in expenses, as we think about 2021 versus last year? And if so, can you give us a sense of what that growth rate is?
Christa Davies: Yeah. So, Suneet, this is a great question and thank you for asking. And so what you’re really seeing is just $200 million come out of Q4 and then of that $135 million goes into Q2 and $65 million goes into Q3. Suneet that is before growth and so you should assume growth is built on top of that and we haven’t given that growth rate. But what I would say is, it’s in the context of full year margin expansion for 2021 on top of a track record of, as you know, Suneet, over the last 10 years of 890 basis points over the last 10 years so approximately 90 basis points a year.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. And then just the last one for me is on the free cash flow, as you mentioned 1Q is typically your lowest quarter, but the growth was quite strong this quarter. Was there anything sort of unusual from a timing perspective and maybe something was pulled forward in 1Q or just want to get some color on that?
Christa Davies: Yeah. I mean we do expect to drive free cash flow growth annually over the long-term building on our track record of 14% CAGR over the last 10 years. I mean Q1 free cash flow was exceptionally strong driven by operating income growth, very strong operating income growth in the quarter. Given our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson and especially the impact of free cash flow relating to achieving the $800 million of cost synergies, we’re not providing standalone guidance for Aon at this time. But we do remain incredibly excited for the long-term cash flow potential of the pending combination.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, I just want to make sure I understood correctly that $800 you -- you essentially said that the $800 million of expenses for the deals, you’re reaffirming that even with some remedies or divestitures, I guess, that have been offered up to regulators. Is that what you said, Christa?
Christa Davies: That is correct, Elyse.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Great. And then my second question, I’m not sure how much detail you guys want to go into and you obviously read in the press in terms of what divestitures might have been offered up? I know there was a $1.8 trillion kind of divestiture cap included within the merger. Is there any way that you could speak to that and give us a sense of whether you would be willing to go a certain amount above that level or any color you can give us in reference at $1.8 billion that was laid out with the merger?
Christa Davies: So, Elyse, we’re not going to speculate on remedies. We have confirmed that we’ll put remedies. We’re continuing to work collaboratively with regulators and we continue to anticipate, as I mentioned, the $800 million of cost synergies considering the remedies offered. And we’d expect to allocate any divestiture proceeds according to our ROIC framework in which share buyback continues to be our highest return activity.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then on the tax rate, I was interested in how your tax rate was impacted by guilty and beat [ph] the last couple of years? And then also on the tax side the doubling the guilty as Biden has proposed have a tangible impact on your tax rate all else equal?
Christa Davies: So, Elyse, we’re not giving guidance -- tax guidance going forward. But I would say as we look back historically, exclusively there would be impact of discrete items which can be positive or negative in a quarter, our historical underlying rate over the last four years has been 18%.
Elyse Greenspan: And then one last one, you guys have said that Q1 had a tough comp and then, obviously, the macroeconomic environment improved, perhaps, you have exited [ph] 6% for the quarter. When we think about the mid single-digit organic outlook of greater, does it feel like to you that four or three quarters just assuming the economy continued to improve should be greater than the Q1, given that we would get the better economy impacting organic as we go through the year?
Greg Case: Yeah. I would really highlight, Elyse is, as you go back really Q1 last year, which is really pre-pandemic, there really wasn’t a lot of pandemic embedded in it and we were just observing 6% against that is a great start to the year, just really underscores the momentum we have. We’re obviously not going to give guidance other than the mid single-digit as we proceed through the year, assuming macroeconomic conditions continue to trend in the right direction. But we would just observe within the Commercial Risk at 9% organic and Reinsurance at 6% and Retirement at 5% and Health at 4%. It was a really strong start to the year with momentum. And the data analytics piece, Christa described before, obviously, as against a pre-pandemic quarter with some pressure around travel and events, but that’s going to come back very, very strongly when it does. So we are -- macroeconomic conditions hold, we are comfortable with mid single-digit or greater.
Elyse Greenspan: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. So, first, I just had a question on your overall view of the potential accretion from the Willis deal. I think when you have previously talked publicly you’ve assumed no dispositions, and obviously, you’re going to have to do some dispositions, and your $800 million target seems unchanged on expense savings. How do you think about the overall accretion from the deal and do you think you’ll still be able to hit your previous assumptions, given that you’ll be able to do something with the proceeds from the business dispositions or do you think there is…
Christa Davies: Yeah.
Jimmy Bhullar: … downside to the initial numbers?
Christa Davies: So, Jimmy, what we would say is, we’re not providing updated guidance at this time. Once we close we’ll certainly look forward to updating it. But what we will say is that the $800 million remains regardless of remedies. And we would note that when we originally got the $800 million of guidance on expense savings that was on an EPS base that was going to grow, it’s pre-pandemic and so the math obviously $800 million of expenses on a smaller basis it’s still a very positive outcome. And then the last thing I’d say is, clearly, none of that math assumed any upside in terms of revenue growth and meeting unmet needs of clients, which is really the entire strategic rationale of the transaction. But, Greg, perhaps, do you want to talk about this?
Greg Case: Jimmy, if you take a step back and think about what we were really a little over a year ago March 2020 as we announced the combination, we described by the way an opportunity was grounded with the $800 million, as Christa just described, but really was about opportunity, opportunity for clients, opportunity for colleagues, obviously, having delivered that opportunity for shareholders. And we described that literally, if you think about that opportunity, in the next five years, from our standpoint, from a value creation standpoint, we think it is as strong as we had ever seen anyway in our 10 plus years. And if that includes 10 years of circa almost 1,200 basis points improvement on return on invested capital and close to 1,600 basis points improvement on free cash flow margin. So, from a real shareholder value standpoint, a year ago, we’re just -- we are really excited about this. I would tell you over the course of the year, having spent time with Willis Towers Watson colleagues that conviction has only grown. And everything you see and we’ve talked about externally, as Christa described very well, it doesn’t include how we’re thinking about accelerating innovation. And there’s a lot that’s kind of going on as we’ve begun the integration in terms of how this plays out, that really has been -- it’s been really exciting. I mean the momentum is building around this with our colleagues, it’s quite, quite high and we’re just looking forward to all aspects, client, colleagues and shareholder impact.
Jimmy Bhullar: And then maybe one either for Greg or for Eric, can you talk about, it seems like your comments on pricing are a little bit subdued or less upbeat than some of the underwriters. But what you’re seeing in terms of pricing change in Commercial and then Reinsurance as well?
Eric Andersen: Sure. Greg, maybe I’ll take that. But before I do, if I can make a comment on your earlier question just on the excitement around the combination of what we’re starting to see maybe a level lower. Certainly the teams have been working on integration from a client experience and a revenue standpoint, culture innovation, all those things and we’re really beginning to see the possibilities as we go deeper into the organization around the planning process, whether it’s things like on the risk side, the cat modeling and securitization experience that Aon has, the Willis’s climate capabilities in their Resilience Hub and their climate type. Those types of things, when you put them together, really do provide excitement for our teams to see what’s possible and so there’s a lot of those things that we’re identifying as we go through the process and it’s really building some excitement across both organizations, as they really begin to see the value they can unlock for clients. And so now maybe to get your question on pricing, I would say this, the dynamic of the pricing as we say, it’s moderately positive. But it’s always -- it’s never a straightforward answer, right? And I’ll give you some context as to why. We engage with these clients in a couple of steps before you ever get to the marketplace, right? We do the risk analysis and identification. We work with them on mitigating strategies, so that they don’t even transfer the risk. How they can finance it among themselves? And then ultimately, if they do decide to make the transfer to a third-party, they’re coming at this marketplace with their own risk appetite, their own budget capacity, the options in the market. We’re using our capability to help them make the trade-offs. But, ultimately, in each product, there is no marketplace, right? So I always get a kick out of when people talk about their broader market. It’s a series of micro markets. Each product has its own dynamics, own claim trends, terms conditions, retentions, claims, supply demand, all of that. Whether you’re talking property, D&O, marine, it’s a variety of different things. And ultimately, our role in this is to help clients evaluate how to manage the risk, make the right choices that they can make it -- they can make. So as we see it, it’s moderate -- it’s moderately positive, as we say, but ultimately, clients make choices in every market that help them meet their own needs.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Phil Stefano: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. I guess, just a quick follow-up on the pending acquisition of Willis Towers Watson. So, there was a question earlier about the $1.8 billion revenue marker in the agreement. To me this is a pretty specific number, can you give any flavor on how this number came to be that that was the line in the sand that which we might need to go back and get approvals?
Greg Case: Yeah. If we step back, again, the shareholder value question was asked and answered as we did in August. We would come back relatively opportunity that we see and how it’s evolved over time. What we really want you to take away is, the opportunity we saw a year ago is stronger now than we saw a year ago. By the way that’s not just the work that Eric described and how the teams have come together and seeing all the possibilities, that’s also pandemic. One of the outcomes of pandemic is really an amplification in both awareness across the globe, literally across every company in the world, there’s a bigger awareness for things like pandemic, climate, intangible assets, cyber than more than ever before. Also up into the C suite in ways that it has permeated before. So, for us, so we see a tremendous opportunity. We saw that opportunity as we brought together the discussion around the combination in last March and we see it continuing. So from our standpoint, as Christa described at the beginning, we’re making our way through the process and making good progress and we’re very excited about the outcome.
Phil Stefano: Okay. Worth a shot. Christa, you had mentioned the expense guidance that you gave and we -- I appreciate that, that has some potential resumption in T&E for later this year. I was hoping you could just kind of flush out what -- how you’re thinking about, without any specifics, just kind of generally how you’re thinking about that, right? If I want to run an actual versus expected of the world opening back up and people getting back to whatever normal business activities look like moving forward, how can I compare that to how you are thinking about it?
Christa Davies: Yeah. So, I guess, I’d start with. We’ve got a 10-year track record of margin expansion approximately 90 basis points for a decade every year. We expect margin expansion for the full year 2021 and we’re obviously not giving specific guidance for margin expansion for 2021. But I’d say if you look to the rest of 2021, we should anticipate some investment in the business and some potential of resumption of T&E later in the year and that’s really all in the context of overall margin expansion for 2021. But if you -- but Greg you might want to talk about this from a client perspective and how we’re thinking about T&E and delivering to clients.
Greg Case: Yeah. Phil, it’s really an excellent question to answer how the business evolves and this idea of new better, we’re not kidding, actually it’s been amazing. The 10 coalitions we have are literally the major cities around the world in Chicago, in New York, in London, in Tokyo and Madrid, Singapore, et cetera. These are largest companies in the world. We’ll be comparing notes on how they come back together work, travel and being in the process. And we’ve just taken away a huge amount from that. And in many respects when we think about client leadership and how we engage with clients obviously the face-to-face is key and it will continue to be key. But our ability to make a difference with clients in remote environments where we can actually amplify what it means to be a United literally bringing colleagues from around the world, obviously, in a virtual way to clients has proven to us to be an unbelievably effective on both new business, with existing clients relative net new opportunities. So very, very -- you compel it. Eric led -- you’ve led this work around the world. Maybe you can talk a bit about this, because it’s very important as you think about T&E overall.
Eric Andersen: Yeah. Sure, Greg. And look we’re going to be smart about how we view T&E in the future as business opens up in-person meetings and it’s ultimately a positive step in the global recovery that we can interact. And -- but we’ve learned a lot, right? As we’ve said it in the past and just using that example, Greg, to go a little bit deeper. Historically, if a client wanted to talk about a situation that was occurring outside their home country, we even try and do a conference call or plan a trip. And now what we do is we open up WebEx and we actually have the leader of the country, leader of the issue in that country on the WebEx and we can solve the issue right away, right? Certainly, there’s efficiency and cost advantages to it, but more importantly, I think, there’s enormous client value to unlock that expertise in an immediate way where they’re not getting an interpretation through someone else. They’re talking right to the source and getting that value in real time. So, I mean, ultimately we’re going to we’re going to use what we’ve learned. We’re going to meet the clients where they want to be met. But I think we’ve learned a lot and we’re going to apply it.
Greg Case: One thing, just final piece I’ll add on this because it’s really -- it’s important to us, because we really worked it for a decade. Obviously, anybody can open up WebEx as Eric described AND put faces on there. But when you actually put colleagues around the world from different solution lines together and it’s clearly the client that they know each other, they’re reacting to different situations. They’re supporting each other. That’s not duplicatable, right? That’s taken us a decade to work through. And so the IT -- it turns out there are 10 faces on the screen amplifies what it means to work and united together as one firm and that’s what clients see, they’ve commented on to us, which is, wow, I didn’t really understand what this meant before. But the only way they could have seen it, as Eric has described, we put 10 people in a conference room, which we’re never going to do, but 10 on WebEx totally interacting on behalf of clients really addressing their issues. That is pretty cool. The example I gave and the commentary upfront around the vaccine protection was exactly that. It was a group of people together that probably would have gotten together in the same way before. So we just want you to -- we don’t understand how we’re thinking about our business as T&E comes back, but it’s much, much broader than that.
Phil Stefano: Okay. Thanks. Thanks for all the color. I’ll take a swing at one more. When I look at the, what I would call the underlying expenses, this revenue less operating -- adjusted operating income in the first quarter? Is there anything abnormal in the growth rate or anything that you’d call out that makes the growth rate. We saw first quarter 2021 versus first quarter 2020 not a good way to think about this?
Christa Davies: So, if you’re talking about expenses, Phil, what I’ve noticed in expenses is in 2021 you have a lot less G&A and you have a lot less investment in the business compared to Q1 2020. So the margin expansion is much more pronounced in Q1 that you might -- than you might get in the full year. We do expect full year margin expansion. And then we did see an increase in comp and benefits due to FX, but also due to investment in the business. And so I guess that probably the two unusual things I’d sort of note in Q1.
Phil Stefano: Great. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
David Motemaden: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to just talk about the strong level of organic growth this quarter. So, I guess, I was just wondering, is there anything one-off in this result this quarter? And just as I think about the rest of the years, is there any reason why we shouldn’t expect an acceleration inorganic growth from these levels?
Greg Case: As we described, David, listen, our view is great momentum as we began the year, no doubt. First quarter strong across the board on all aspects with some real standouts and we see as macroeconomic conditions evolve mid single-digit or greater macroeconomic conditions evolve, mid single-digit or greater as we think about where we are for the year. And obviously, the first quarter gave us real confidence -- growing confidence in that assuming macroeconomic conditions.
David Motemaden: Got it. And nothing one-off in that result that would leave you, I think, that…
Greg Case: No.
David Motemaden: … we should come down off of the sets. Okay. That’s helpful.
Greg Case: Yeah. It was really across the Board in terms of sort of all the different aspects, Commercial Risk, Reinsurance, Retirement and Health across the Board with real great work by the teams around the world on new business growth and growth in project related work which came back a bit particularly in some of the search lines.
David Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just on the combination with Willis, Christa, I think, you had said something to the effect that you would expect to achieve the $800 million of cost synergies in any level of concessions. But I guess I just wanted to sort of dig into that is like you had -- maybe just talk about, is there a level that would make that tough to achieve and just sort of -- maybe just sort of peel back the onion a little bit on just what gave you confidence that you can get to that $800 million of saves.
Christa Davies: Yeah. So, David, we continue to anticipate $800 million of cost synergies considering the remedies we’ve offered and we’d expect to allocate any divestiture proceeds according to our ROIC framework in which share buyback continues to be our highest expected return activity. I would note that the $800 million of cost synergies, we’re very confident in achieving. It’s 5.5% of the combined cost base. And we achieved 11% of the combined cost base today on U.S. and 18% of the combined cost base today Benfold and there’s no structural differences here. And so, we feel really good about achieving that $800 million.
David Motemaden: Got it. Helpful. That’s clear. And then maybe if I could just sneak one more in, just on the margin, you guys obviously, I appreciate the slide you guys put in the deck. You guys have expanded margins by 90 basis points a year over the last decade. You did 170 basis points in the first quarter. Obviously, you need comps there and I know that you guide for the full year? But I guess is there any reason to expect that expand -- margins shouldn’t expand here over the next three quarters?
Christa Davies: So, first of all, David, we absolutely expect full year margin expansion for the year 2021 and we think about margin expansion in the context of full year, because quarter-to-quarter our expenses will be lumpy as we sort of talked about with the re-patenting of expenses. But what we would say is, Q1 was unusual in terms of margin expansion, because we had a pre-pandemic comparable in Q1 2020. And so I think about margin expansion over the course of the full year 2021. And as you said, we had a 10-year track record of 890 basis points of margin expansion over the last 10 years, so 90 basis points a year. And we’re on track to do full year margin expansion again in 2021.
David Motemaden: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is now open.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. I guess beginning with basic question, you talked a little bit about the blockchain for a premium clearinghouse. How should we expect to see that in the financial, I don’t mean numbers, but where does that make a difference?
Christa Davies: Yeah. I mean it really makes a difference in terms of margin expansion. It’s driving improved quality and therefore reduced errors. And it’s driving efficiency, because it’s allowing colleagues to spend more time on high value activities with their client. So it’s both reduced errors and improved efficiency. And then utilizing client experience, but I mean, Meyer, the simple answer is operating margin expansions.
Meyer Shields: Okay. No. That’s perfect. That’s exactly what I was looking for. Same question, you never, I think, disclosed a number of expected revenue synergies from the innovation. I know that the $800 million savings guidance is still there. Is the internal number for revenues still the same?
Greg Case: Well, as we said before, we didn’t disclosed, Meyer, as you described, but the entire region we are bringing the combination together, really goes back to this idea of we’ve accelerate -- we’ve got to find ways to accelerate innovation on behalf of clients, continue to do what we’re doing but just keep getting better on their behalf. And Meyer it’s not hard to find the categories where we can continue to improve and support. Look at issues like pandemic obviously, but we are -- how we are going to bring solutions that really matter for clients and climate. It is as I think about taking actions to go zero carbon. How do we help them reduce volatility in the way that. We had a set of use back in March 2020 on that. Eric I think describe it very well, as we spent time with our colleagues at Willis Towers Watson we see more potential and possibilities than ever and pandemic happened. So clients are actually more attuned to like. What am I going to do on this and I’m not going to play it out. Things like intangible assets. We’ve made great progress on tangible assets and how you think about defending the house on intangible assets. But now with Willis Towers Watson the opportunity we believe is even greater, areas like cyber, et cetera. So we are -- we were excited in 2020 around the possibilities on what we can do to drive innovation, which is in fact net new opportunity for clients and for our colleagues, but also revenue and we see that opportunity greater now than we saw at a year ago.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: Thank you, Brittney. I just wanted to say to everyone thank you very much for joining this quarter. We appreciate it and very much look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. All participants may disconnect at this time.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. And thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties the call is being recorded. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences is described in the press release covering our third quarter 2020 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc. Sir, you may begin.
Greg Case: Thank you, Catherine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 conference call. I'm joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. There are very few firms who can say they end in 2020 stronger than they began. And I want to thank our colleagues for making Aon one of those firms. Our team delivered a tremendous year set against the public health and economic impact of COVID-19 and an overall unprecedented level of global volatility punctuated by social unrest around the world. During the year, our colleagues came together to deliver results for clients, devote time and energy to getting to know the Willis Towers Watson team and the integration planning for our pending combination and to support each other through personal and professional challenges. One silver lining that we heard over and over from colleagues was the 2020 was a year of increased connection across our firm. We saw our colleagues respond to the virtual environment for replacing in person connections with introducing experts and sharing thought leadership with clients. We felt the impact of that connectivity as our COVID-19 taskforce ramped up to share insights and best practices. And we saw it translate into client success as local teams won new business by seamlessly bringing together colleagues from across the globe. By all accounts 2020 tested our firm. Looking back, it's clear that our colleagues not only passed, but this adversity actually accelerated our one firm strategy. Seeing our colleagues come together and forge stronger connections in new ways was inspirational. And we'll build on these positive learnings and practices in 2020 as we continue to reject the constraints of the so called new normal, and instead look forward to defining a new better on our terms as we begin 2021. Turning into financial performance in the fourth quarter, we delivered a great finish to the year with 2% organic revenue growth across the firm, including 12% growth in reinsurance solutions and 4% growth in commercial risk resolutions. As in recent quarters, organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strength in the core areas of our business, reflecting the resilience of our firm in a challenging economic environment, overcoming ongoing unexpected pressure in the more discretionary areas. In particular, we would highlight growth in the core, driven by ongoing strong retention and net new business generation. As we continue to deliver innovative solutions to our clients in a challenging environment. We saw increased organic revenue growth as compared to the third quarter despite that somewhat larger portion of more discretionary revenues in the fourth quarter. The strong results stem partially from improvements in economic factors, and sentiment around the virus and vaccine, which drives client buying behavior and investment. For example, we saw positive impacts to our revenue from construction starts and M&A activity in the US, as well as from employment levels. I would also note that in more discretionary areas, we're seeing meaningful variation in revenue growth across our businesses, with some recovering more quickly and some more slowly, largely driven by external factors tied to economic reopening, and recovery. For example, I would highlight strength and voluntary benefits in Health Solutions, and construction and commercial risk. I would also note that more discretionary areas like travel and events within data analytics and even capital within retirement solutions continue to be impacted by economic and pandemic related conditions. Our strong finish in Q4 contributed to full year financial results that demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business in this uncertain economic environment. For the year, we delivered organic revenue growth of 1%, operating income growth of 4% with full year operating margins of 28.5%, an increase of 100 basis points from 2019 and free cash flow growth of 64% to $2.6 billion, the highest free cash flow in the history of our firm. This outstanding progress against each of our key financial metrics is a direct result of our one firm strategy, which guides everything we do in supporting colleagues, delivering value to clients and driving shareholder value. We are well positioned to continue to build on this momentum. And while we see many positive signs for the economy, significant uncertainty remains and we expect the recovery will remain inconsistent. We continue to monitor several key factors including GDP, asset values, corporate revenues and employment. As we looked at 2021 with significant uncertainty remains, we expect as economic conditions continue to stabilize and improve; we anticipate modest growth in Q1, with growth increasing toward mid-single digits as we continue through the year. Looking back, the challenges we faced in 2020 underscore the importance of our colleagues, our culture, and our commitment to inclusion and diversity. We've long observed that leaders who embody one firm are most successful leaders, both in delivering business results and driving colleague engagement. And this year, we've seen that in such a leadership trait results even stronger engagement and competence in the combination, as measured in a January poll survey reflecting high engagement, we consistently lower voluntary attrition, which decreased by 35%, year-over-year from 2020 with strength in every major region and solution line. Further, we know that diverse talent, expertise and insights of our colleagues are vital to the success of our firm and our clients. And we continue to invest to attract growth and retain the best talent. We supported this priority; we announced the expansion of our apprenticeship program, including an investment of $30 million over the next five years, and development of a nationwide network of employers to create 10,000 apprenticeships by 2030. With this expansion we're building on our already successful program, which bridges the gap from education to employment for bringing high school graduates into the workforce while they complete their college education. This program provides a fantastic pipeline of diverse talent and embodies our commitment to inclusion and diversity. In addition to emphasizing the importance of our colleagues and our culture, the events of 2020 expose the interconnected nature of risks and vulnerabilities in many companies. Our recently published 2020 risk report highlights the increasing likelihood of connected extremes and reinforces that leading organizations of the future will be defined by their ability to manage the global implications of long tail risks. In the survey of over 500 organizations, across geographies and industries 82% did not had pandemic in their Top 10 risks before COVID-19 struck, and only 30% had a pandemic plan in place. Looking forward, respondents overwhelmingly agreed on the need for an enterprise wide approach to risk. We know that existing emerging long tail risks will continue to challenge organizations across all industries and geographies. Organizations must prioritize strategies to address risk and resilience. We also know our strategy enabled us to support clients in this changing landscape because it enabled us to understand their biggest challenges and bring world class content capability and innovative solutions to bear. And while we didn't architect or pending combination with Willis Towers Watson with the pandemic in mind, we see that the pandemic and its associated economic impacts had increased our conviction and the need to accelerate innovation to address client demand. On the topic of Willis Towers Watson, our excitement about the combination as well as the leadership and talent from both sides continues to grow. Last week, we reached another important milestone with the announcement of the combined executive committee that will be in place once the combination is closed. This team embraces the commitment to a one firm mindset and brings together the best expertise, talent and leadership from both organizations. This team also brings to the table an exceptional set of experiences and capability, reinforcing the power of inclusion. As we said before, our culture is built to bring the best of our firm to clients. It's an essential part of how we operate our firm and drive results. At Willis Towers Watson, it's clear that their culture is equally focused on putting clients first; this newly announced team will blend the best of those cultures. And that client focus mindset will guide everything we do. In summary, 2020 was a momentous year. Our performance and actions throughout the year reflect exceptional resilience. Now the results of structural steps and investments we've made to ensure we're ready to not only take on but grow stronger in the face of these challenges. Further, we've demonstrated momentum that will accelerate in combination with Willis Towers Watson. We begin 2021 in a position of strength to continue executing our strategy and making progress on our key financial metrics, both the standalone Aon and in our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson creating a significant growth opportunity for clients, for colleagues and for shareholders. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial progress this year, and long-term outlook. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered a strong operational and financial performance in Q4 to finish the year despite continuing macroeconomic challenges, demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our business in any economic environment. Turning to our results, we delivered organic revenue growth of 2% in the fourth quarter, and 1% for the full year, driven by ongoing strength in our core business, offset by pressure in our more discretionary areas. I would note total reported revenue was up slightly overcoming a nearly $100 million headwind from the unfavorable impact of changes in FX as well as low fiduciary investment income to the lower interest rates globally. We also delivered operational improvement for the full year with operating income growth of 4% and operating margin expansion of 100 basis points to 28.5%, continuing our trajectory of long-term sustainable margin expansion. For the full year, adjusted operating expenses declined 1% due to expense discipline, and a reduction in travel and entertainment, offset by increased compensation costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 4% in the fourth quarter. Putting Q4 in context, due to the significant uncertainty we saw during the year, we tightly controlled our expense base and the level of long-term investment in the business. During 2020, our organic revenue growth improved sequentially in the second quarter through the fourth quarter, as internal and external factors contribute to a strong finish to the year. This led to a year-over-year increase in compensation benefits spent in the fourth quarter, a portion of which was variable compensation. This resulted in a full year increase in adjusted compensation and benefit expense of 1%. I would also note the compensation expense increase in part because of our commitment during 2020 to retain all 50,000 colleagues, as well as lower voluntary attrition, which Greg described. As we said before, we make decisions on expenses and margins in the context of each full year and expect to continue to drive margin expansion in 2021. For the full year, we translated strong operational performance into EPS growth of 7%. Overcoming a headwind from FX translation. If continued to remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect a favorable impact of approximately $0.20 per share, or approximately $60 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2021 due to a weaker dollar versus the euro. A key driver of our operational success has been the history of investment in our Aon Business Services platform, which has undergone significant transformation over the last several years. The journey began with an initial group of 4,000 colleagues after the divestiture of our outsourcing business in 2017. By centralizing activities, eliminating inefficiencies and promoting standardization, we delivered higher quality self-service levels and cost savings with better scalability, flexibility and enhanced colleague experience. Today, approximately 13,000 of Aon's 50,000 colleagues are part of Aon Business Services focused on driving operational improvement, and enhancing how we serve clients. In 2020, for instance, we completed our data center consolidation program in the Americas, closing an additional 10 data center and achieving $23 million of annual savings. We increased usage of our digital signatures tool by over 110%, saving more than 65,000 hours annually. We renewed 90% of the nearly 9,000 US Commercial risk licenses paperlessely, and we improved our global operations and share capabilities by delivering over a million hours of automation, freeing colleague capacity for high value activities with clients. Looking forward, we expect to leverage our Aon Business Services platform to continue to drive sustainable margin expansion. In addition, we see opportunities to embed best practices around agility and productivity into how and where we operate, ultimately reducing our overall real estate footprint over the long term. Heading to cash and capital allocation, free cash flow increased 64% to $2.6 billion, primarily driven by working capital improvements, including improved collections, a decrease in restructuring cash outlays, and strong operational improvements. We remain focused on maximizing the translation of revenue into the highest level of free cash flow, as highlighted by our free cash flow margin of 23.9%, up substantially from last year. We allocate capital based on return on invested capital, cash on cash returns. We continue to maximize shareholder value creation, highlighted by the 800 million of share repurchase in the quarter, and nearly $1.8 billion in 2020. In 2021, we expect to continue to allocate capital according to this framework, and we expect share purchase will continue to be our highest return on capital investment given our free cash flow evaluation and outlook. We expect to remain highly focused on closing and then successfully integrating our combination with Willis Towers Watson. Following that we expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content added capabilities in our priority areas. We remain very confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well laid debt maturity profile. Historically, we've looked to increase debt as EBITDA grows while maintaining leverage ratios. However, due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we expect to continue to manage our leverage ratios conservatively in the near future and return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows over the long term. As I look towards 2021, and our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, I'd like to reiterate how excited we are about the newly announced leadership team and the significant shareholder value creation potential we see in bringing together our two complimentary businesses, both from a top line growth driven by accelerated innovation for clients, and from the bottom-line impact of $800 million in cost synergies. We continue to work collaboratively with the appropriate regulators to gain approval, and are focused on achieving a result that optimizes shareholder value. We remain committed to an expected close in the first half of 2021. In summary, our business has shown resiliency through the challenges of 2020. Our Aon united strategy underpinned by our Aon Business Services operational platform has enabled historically high free cash flow of $2.6 billion and enabled us to return nearly $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders in 2020. As we head into 2021, through our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, this momentum will continue to enable long-term shareholder value creation. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Dave Styblo of Jefferies.
DaveStyblo: Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I want to just circle back on your 2021 comments and appreciate the color there on the organic revenue cadence, which seems to make sense. I did want to ask a little bit more about the margin expansion opportunity. I know you talked about they're still having an ability to expand margins this year, of course. And in that context, it's still going to be tough to achieve 70 to 80 basis points of margin expansion towards your long-term target, given that you still might not have fully returned to the normalized cost base, or are there other efficiencies that you've been able to realize through COVID more work from home or other efficiencies, lower travel and expenses, that still might make that range feasible this year?
ChristaDavies: Thanks so much for the question, Dave. So we are certainly committed to margin expansion in 2021. And we don't give specific margin guidance in terms of how much we would grow each year. But as today, we've driven long-term margins of 880 basis points over the last 11 years. So 88 basis points a year on average. And we that are really driven by accelerating organic revenue growth, the portfolio mix shift to higher revenue growth, higher margin areas. And obviously, as you noted, the Aon Business Services platform continues to drive productivity and efficiency for us. And that will continue to occur Dave, in 2021, we're really excited, as Greg highlighted, about accelerating growth, year-over-year, trending towards mid-single digits in the second half of the year. And the margin expansion will be a result of that growth, the portfolio mix shift and the productivity from Aon Business Services.
DaveStyblo: Okay, thanks. And then just on the free cash flow, stepping off point from the $2.6 billion, had some easier tailwinds of things that weren't going to recur in 2020. As you jump off from that, though, is there anything to note that's unusual in the 2020? Is that basically a clean number to go from there? And then a related question to that. I know you've been continuing to make progress towards your $500 million of working capital improvement over time. How far into that? How much of that have you achieved so far?
ChristaDavies: Yes, so Dave, first of all, the $2.6 billion is a clean number. And so that there's nothing unusual about that number. And then in terms of working capital, we obviously made some progress on working capital, as you saw in 2020. But we've actually said that the $500 million is still the right long-term target for Aon on working capital. So and Dave, the thing I think I said before on that $500 million is that's just the number that gets you to working capital neutral, there are several countries in which we operate. Where working capital positive, we think that is entirely reasonable for a professional services firm. And so we think that a $500 million is a conservative number. And we're definitely targeting underlying free cash flow growth over the long term in the double-digit range.
DaveStyblo: Okay, great. And then maybe a question for Greg and Eric, just about client engagement and retention, how bad is this looking as you go forward into the year and new opportunities that continue to emerge from Covid? Maybe any changes in client demand or services that Aon can bring to the table better than peers that you would highlight?
GregCase: Maybe I'll start with that Dave and then Eric shared a number of examples we could draw from. We say, listen, as client, need and pressure continues to increase; it really does give us a great opportunity to connect with them. And for all of its challenges and issues that COVID has brought to us, and they've been many, one of the things that have also done with our Aon Business Services platform has allowed us to connect to clients, even more effectively. Even yesterday, I was on a call that would have been a client meeting a year ago with 100 clients, plus, we had 1,000 clients on yesterday. And so our ability to actually connect with clients and actually demonstrate the full capability of the firm at a time of high need is actually going up. So you're seeing more and more examples of our ability to drive new business, but as well as, do more with existing clients, given the capabilities we've gotten really, it's happening all across the firm. But maybe, Eric, a couple of examples from your standpoint to bring it forward.
EricAndersen: Sure, Greg. And I think it's really based on the Aon united model that we've been working on, where you certainly have to be excellent in each of our subject matter capabilities and topics. But you have to work together to manage the client in a more holistic way. And so topics like health, retirement, talent are all really from Aon when you think about the COVID angle of the question. And these topics aren't going away. How we deal with voluntary benefits, pooled employer plans, comp insights, all critical as our clients are looking to manage their colleagues through this pandemic, not to mention sort of the return to workplace. So as we look out in 2021we see a lot of opportunity to really help our clients during the challenging time.
Operator: The next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.
ElyseGreenspan: Hi, thanks and good morning. My first question, you guys had pointed to the larger discretionary piece of your business in the fourth quarter and serving to pressure organic, you guys came in positive too so it seems like there was much better strength across many of your businesses probably than you expected three months ago. So maybe you could help us understand that. And then with that same discretionary piece, given that reinsurance is a bigger component of the Q1, I'm assuming so that would serve as a tailwind to Q1 organic, just given that more of the reinsurance business comes on in the first quarter, is that factored in to your guide?
GregCase: Elyse, really appreciate the question. As Eric has highlighted, there's so many opportunities that continue to emerge, to help clients in times of need, and they're just continue to emerge around the world. And some of them are happening faster than we thought they would, which I think about the momentum into the fourth quarter, it really was in the core, we continue to perform well there. And then the discretionary pieces, as there was some, promise on the recovery front, the vaccine front, et cetera, we saw some of those discretionary areas, like TL transaction liability construction and employment levels, beginning to come up. But by the way, other areas, we still saw the pressure; I mentioned travel and events for as an example, and some others. So it still remains mixed, but the trend is positive. And what you're really seeing is us, unable to kind of interact in a very positive way with clients. And you're seeing that sort of built into Q4, and you're also seeing it as we think about our opportunities in 2021. On the reinsurance front, again, team is fantastic, Eric you talk about that sort of as we end Q4 see implications, and also the thoughts for the first quarter and 2021 on the reinsurance side, and it was a great work by the team.
EricAndersen: Yes, for sure. Certainly, Q4 has always been our smallest quarter in reinsurance that's been dominated by historically by Fac and investment banking. There were some good treaty wins that happen, certainly, there's a lot of action going on in that space, in the third and fourth quarter, in terms of new clients, new company creation, and the like, until we were there to be able to help those new clients and existing clients really reposition their portfolios as they went into 2021. And I would say that continued into the first quarter, as the market dynamics being what they are, the insurers are certainly looking to position and get support where they needed as they look to grow their own portfolio. So great quarter certainly on the back of a fantastic quarter a year ago. So to see that kind of growth this year off the back of a 70% comparable was a special quarter for the team. And I think that momentum is carrying into the first quarter of this year.
ChristaDavies: The only other thing I'd add is, Elyse, that Q1 2020 was a very strong comparable for us because it largely was completed before COVID hit. And so while we've had terrific momentum coming into 2021, as Eric and Greg described that difficult comparable means that Q1 is likely to be a lower growth quarter than developed to the year.
ElyseGreenspan: Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of expenses, right, I think you guys alluded to right, higher expenses in the fourth quarter, just obviously, the year came in better than you expected. And just tying back to comp and then obviously, less employee turnover, I think you said, but look at the quarters, right? The coupon your expenses were close to flat last year, like is there anything seasonally that you can point out with the expenses as anything to 2021. And obviously, recognizing that you don't give a guide so margin for the quarter, but anything within the expense space that we should be thinking about?
GregCase: No, Elyse, really isn't, we would encourage you to step back and think about it 2020 was truly exceptional, literally and you think about COVID-19. And we grew organically 1% versus last year at 6%, which was one of our all-time highs, expanded margin 100 basis points through 28.5% and free cash as Christa described to the highest level in our history grow 60 plus percent. And this momentum that we built throughout the year in 2020 is we believe is going to carry over into 2021. So there really isn't anything we would focus on Q4, then you would really over rotate on. But it does reflect really the great work of our colleagues and improving external factors which impacted the client [Indiscernible] described. But we wanted to really recognize the performance of our colleagues in the year and that certainly shows up. But we've encouraged you to sort of think about the overall year and the overall momentum that was built and how it's been carrying in to 2021.
ElyseGreenspan: Great. And then one last one, you guys laid out right to mid-single digit or greater organic later in the year. I'm assuming that factors in right that you will close this merger at some point in the first half of the year, obviously, undergoing some regulatory review. So can you just give us an update? I think you said close this year to update timing wise and things where you expect from a regulatory front, and I'm assuming you still expect this deal to close at some point in the first half of 2021.
ChristaDavies: So thanks so much for the question, Elyse. What I would start with is saying the guidance we gave for our revenue was we're moving towards mid-single digit, over the course of the year, so not greater. The second thing I'd say is the guidance is Aon only; we certainly wouldn't give guidance to the combined until we close. And then third, we are on track to close in the first half of the year, as we outlined when we announced a deal.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.
JimmyBhullar: Hi, good morning. So first, I just had a question on the transaction and the Willis deal. You've already obviously put together a management team. So it seems like you're confident that the deal will go through. But what are your views on potential dispositions as you go through the regulatory approval process? And I think you've said in the past, you wouldn't have to do much. But has that changed now as you've had more time?
ChristaDavies: Thanks for the question, Jimmy. We remain incredibly committed to our combinations with Willis Towers Watson. Watson is thrilled about the newly announced leadership team as he described, to lead up and accelerating innovation on behalf of clients and creates shareholder value. The businesses are complimentary and operate in competitive areas of the economy. And we believe we've got the arguments and evidence to ensure a positive outcome. We continue to work collaboratively with the appropriate regulators to gain approvals in a timely manner. And as we've said, since we announced the deal, we expect to close in the first half of 2021. And we're on track to do that.
GregCase: And I would add, Jimmy, I want to come back to the audience for a second, if I could, obviously, we're going to operate completely separately until we close, no question about that we have in every way, shape or form. But we have had a chance to sort of get this group together and begin the planning process. And it just been incredibly extraordinary, very gratifying to see this kind of talent come together to think about what the possibilities are in the future of the firm, both in helping clients in the here and now but also thinking about how we can help them and some of the most important issues as they come forward. And certainly pandemic, the year pandemic has certainly highlighted a number of those, but you think about climate on the horizon. Things like intellectual property, cyber, and all these things are out there. And this team is really beginning to come together, thinking about a one firm approach to how we deliver the best of our capability to them. And it's really been - it's been extraordinary and very, very invigorating for all of us as we come together.
JimmyBhullar: Okay, I guess we'll find out when the approvals come through, but on that, and then relately on the cost savings, as you've looked more into the business, and have you - do you - like it seems like the $800 million targets you've outlined versus historical deals is somewhat conservative. Have your views on that change at all?
ChristaDavies: So Jimmy we would say, we remain at the place where we've been, which is the $800 million, we feel really confident in achieving. It is 5.5% of the combined cost base. That compared to 11% of the combined cost base we achieved today on Hewitt and 18% of the combined cost base we achieved today in Benfield and the components of that, our people and IT and in real estate. And as we've gone into the integration planning, we feel extremely confident about achieving the $800 million. And as we've said, this year we're very sort of confident about achieving that through this based on the strength of Aon Business Services platform, which is allowing us to bring together the operations of Aon and drive improve quality, consistency, and then efficiencies over time.
Operator: The next question is coming from Greg Peters of Raymond James.
GregPeters: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is you've had a lot of time, obviously to study the Willis Towers operations. And one of the areas where I feel like the company has been - hasn't delivered the full benefit of margin improvement would be in their corporate risk and broking business. As you've looked at that business, can you walk us through how your views are on how you can - when it's combined with Aon how you can deliver the margin improvement that you're thinking about?
GregCase: Greg, let me just offer a couple thoughts on that. First, I'll step back and say we have had a lot of time in the planning process over the course and since we announced in March, and I will tell you, we continue to compare notes on the possibilities again we can operate together until we close in any way shape or form. Our excitement on the possibilities continues to build. And it really is in multiple areas, just core content and capability that exists across both organizations. We have very high expectations when we announced March 9, they've been exceeded substantially in multiple categories. And we think about the opportunity to drive growth, organic growth on behalf of clients. And we see it in multiple categories, all of these things come together to reinforce opportunities to both drive top line and also drive margin improvement, which by the way, we see for Aon front and center, before we get anyplace else, so we just want to highlight, we see tremendous opportunity, both on the top line side, and on the margin side for the combined firm, for all the reasons Christa has outlined. And everything we've seen since March 9 has only reinforced that it's just been terrific.
GregPeters: Great. And the second question, I'll pivot back to the organic revenue growth, I mean, we're watching and listening to all the carriers that have reported, talk about how the strong pricing environment has helped not only improve their margins, but improve their revenue growth. And it seems like for Aon that there's been a tailwind benefit on the pricing side. And I'm wondering if you can sort of reconcile the difference between the benefit from pricing and the actual benefit to organic for you guys from unit count growth, if that makes sense.
GregCase: Well, it certainly does, Greg, we would come back and say, listen, from an overall pricing sample; we really look at market impact, which is really a function of how you describe price, and then insurance values and all the things that come with that. And then it really is client behavior. And so from our standpoint, we would say all the pricing impacts have really had modest impact on performance, it really is around what we're doing fundamentally with clients. Maybe I ask Eric to give a couple of examples of where this is but really, Greg, this when we stepped back, it really is about, this is when Aon can really show up and help clients succeed in times of need. And they do a lot of reconfiguring as we think about sort of the environment changes. But maybe Eric, a couple examples of, if does that make sense?
EricAndersen: Sure. Greg, it's never really a straight line between what the carrier points out is what they say, is the unit price versus what a client actually does. Maybe to put it in a little bit of context, when we sit with a client, we first do the risk identification product test, maybe trying to help them understand exactly what risks are trying to protect, can they mitigate it themselves in a way that either through contracts or different changes of behavior? And can they finance it themselves, right, either through a captive or just using their balance sheet. So a lot happens with a client before they even risk transfer. So just always good to keep that in mind. But when they do decide to risk transfer, they certainly go into a market and we help them with insight with regard to options and structures. And whether it's retentions or deductibles, coinsurance limits, a variety of things that clients will look at, in terms of what their budget is able to do. And they'll make their trade off. So it's never really a straight line as to the unit cost as to what the client behavior actually sort of manifests itself in. And you see that in a couple of distressed products that are out there today. Certainly DNO is one that's gotten a lot of attention, how we work with clients to help them make those choices, in terms of the protection that they provide cyber and other property and, catastrophe exposed areas. So there's a lot that goes into before they go to market, as opposed to what they buy inside the marketplace. And so it is frankly an area where our teams have been focused on now for the last 24 months as the market has gotten firmer, to help clients make those trades offs because they're dealing with a marketplace now, at a time when many of them are feeling stress in general on their own businesses. And so how they make those tradeoffs become more acute. In the last, certainly in the last 12 months and would expect that behavior, and that process would continue going into this year.
Operator: The next question is coming from Suneet Kamath of Citi.
SuneetKamath: Thanks. Good morning. So one question we get a lot from investors is that even thinking about the combination with Willis, but some of your clients may want to sort of limit their concentration to a one broker, one advisor. Can you just provide some color on how you're thinking about that? Maybe influenced by the conversations that you're having with your clients.
GregCase: Hey, Suneet. I'll start with the following. We now - it's always been our practice, we step back and sort of we get tremendous amounts of client feedback. We call it voice with the client. And we've done it really for the last decade and continue to sort of probe into that obviously, since the March 9th announcement, we've done a tremendous amount of work for the client, getting their insight, guidance, perspective, views on how we can better best support them and serve them. Now we'll take, it's been overwhelming as we dig in with clients and they understand that we're all about bringing them the best of the now all things they could do in the current environment. Eric just described a number of different challenges are out there and how we're going to help them, help serve them better but also the challenges that used to be on the horizon are now on their doorstep. And they're asking questions around, what about the next pandemic? What do we do? How do I think about cyber right? Markets still relatively small, $6 billion, $7 billion against a connected client, impact of closer to a $1 trillion. Now what do we do about that? By the way, they know climate is going to be front and center already is really going to be front and center. Pandemic is, this virus are behind us. So they're asking questions to me around, how I address these long tail risks. Those are being asked of me by my CFOs, and CEOs and Boards of Directors. So what I'm trying to highlight is need has never been higher. And the solutions that we must bring to bear has got - have got to evolve, we have to be better in supporting them. And then we have to, we start with, we are there with the entire industry, and they see this combination, as a chance to reverse the trend in which our overall relevance has actually declined as a percentage of risk as a percentage of GDP over the last 30 years. And they see real promise in that. So our feedback has been overwhelmingly positive across the globe, on what this combination can mean for them. And we're very excited to work hard to meet those needs on their behalf.
SuneetKamath: Got it. And then just on the regulatory approval front, yesterday, there was a bill that was introduced around potential changes to antitrust reform. I know your deal was announced a while ago. But do you see anything from the new administration because it was yesterday's bill that could impact the timing of the approvals that you get from the regulators?
ChristaDavies: Look, we appreciate the questions, Suneet, but what we would say is as we said since we announced the deal we expect to close in the first half of 2021. And we are on track to do that. And so we are really excited about the combination with Willis Towers Watson, and our newly announced leadership team who will help us in accelerating innovation for clients.
Operator: The next question is coming from Meyer Shields of KBW.
MeyerShields: Thanks. Two questions, I guess. I understand that the outlook for organic growth is for Aon alone, I was hoping you could help us at least think about directionally whether the combination with Willis and the associated innovation. Would that outpace the sort of necessary distractions of integration? Or should we expect maybe some slowdown in organic growth in the earliest parts of the combination post close?
ChristaDavies: So, Meyer, one way to answer this is, if you recall, on the 9th of March, we announced the combination, we actually gave guidance to the combined firm of mid-single digit or greater. And I would note that that is higher than what Willis Towers Watson had produced historically. And the reason and we did mid-single digit growth or greater from year one. And so that gives you a sense of how confident we are in the new areas of unmet client need in our existing business. And in brand new areas of demand, whether or no products and solutions today, areas like intellectual property, climate and cyber. So we're really excited, Meyer, about the growth potential of the combined firm.
MeyerShields: That's very helpful. Second question, Christa, in your opening comments you talked about inorganic growth, after closing on Willis Towers Watson. I know I was hoping you could flush that out in terms of whether we should think about that in your current business lines, or maybe new opportunities for Business Services.
ChristaDavies: So, Meyer, I would say, we're really excited about the potential to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities in areas like digital, where we acquired CoverWallet earlier in 2020; in areas like intellectual property, in areas like climate in areas, so in lots of areas across our business, and so there are many priority areas, Meyer, I would say where they are higher revenue growth, high margin high return on capital businesses, and we're really excited about investing in these areas to develop new solutions for clients to meet their unmet needs.
Operator: And our last question is coming from Phil Stefano of Deutsche Bank.
PhilStefano: Yes, thanks in discussing debt leverage, it feels like the plan is to keep it low versus historical leverage at this point, and then re-continue to grow debt with EBITDA. I mean was this a structural shift downwards in what you think the appropriate debt leverage is at this point? Or is there some kind of debt issuance catch up coming in the out years as the uncertainties of the current environment abates.
ChristaDavies: Yes, thanks for the question, Phil. What I would say is, it's really about the fact that we're managing conservatively our cash levels, given the macroeconomic uncertainty, which still remains, and we're obviously heading into Q1, which is our seasonally lowest, free cash flow quarter of the year. But I'd say we're fully committed to maintaining our current credit ratings. And longer term, we will look to increase debt to EBITDA ratio while maintaining leverage ratios.
PhilStefano: Okay. For the FX impact, you had highlighted $0.20 impact in first quarter of 2021. Can you frame for us what this could look like at current exchange rates for the full year or even looking past first quarter?
ChristaDavies: We haven't given that guidance. So but what I would say is Q1 is the majority of the impact the year. It's primarily driven by a higher Euro versus US dollar. And Q1 is our Euro centric quarter.
PhilStefano: Okay. All right. And the last one for you and this is very philosophical. So I apologize for that. But thank you for the comment on the expanded apprenticeship program and how it impacts diversity inclusion. I guess I was hoping you could talk a little bit about ESG and the strategy there. And part of to me, what is underlying this question is we've seen some carriers step away from certain products like coal, and that they're not going to ensure projects like that anymore. I mean, look, when I think of AI, I think of a solution for unmet needs and being strategic and how you help clients place that risk. But if carriers are stepping away from things like that. And to me there could be competing efforts of you being a solution for unmet needs, but also having your own ESG policies that maybe coal isn't within your wheelhouse anymore. So coal is just an example. But you can talk more broadly than that, but just to help you clarify how I'm thinking about this?
GregCase: Phil, it isn't philosophical at all. It's a terrific question. I really appreciate it. So listen, we are absolutely committed in every way to implementing ESG best practices, internally for sure. And to promote resiliency, but listen to the picture on is so important. The role the industry can play relating to climate, it isn't just across the province; it's one of the greatest opportunities for us, again, if you think about where we are, everyone's focused on pandemic in many respects now. But this - when we get to decide this is behind us, climate change in our view, is front and center. And it's going to be a challenge when you to think about matching capital with risk, not to solve with energy sources, but literally the transition risks, the clients position pressure, you are getting the transition volatility that the clients encounters, they think about going from point A to point B, that's the - that should be our wheelhouse. That is how do we identify capability? How do I know if our capital helps him do that? And the combination with Willis Towers Watson, we believe we will be formidable. There's tremendous capability. And Willis Towers Watson and John Haley and the team have done a great job developing over time, that combined with that we have, we think we have a shot to really make a difference, helping clients make better decisions, as they think about this transition volatility that everyone is going to encounter as you think about addressing the climate challenges. So this is a high priority for us inside of Aon in our own world, for sure. And you'll see that by the way, we've got an upcoming 2020 impact report that's going to detail our commitment, around carbon neutrality and all pieces around that. But really, the opportunity here is what we can do on behalf of clients. And it is in our view, again, another opp; it's just not been addressed in a way that's meaningful. And it's a real opportunity for the industry to make a difference and we look forward to doing it.
PhilStefano: Thanks. And just one quick follow up on that. I guess part of the question is - is there a conflict? Am I thinking about this, right, that some of the clients who have unmet needs you may not be able to meet those needs simply because of your own ESG framework? And certain pieces of environmentally risky business that you might want to get away from?
GregCase: Yes, listen, at the individual level, there's always different circumstances that are going to come up. If you take a step back and think about the implications of climate change overall, this is the global economy. This is largely massive, massive challenge around increased volatility that's going to be absorbed by companies as they address this challenge. Our ability to help reduce that over time is we think substantial. And that is why in the end, this is a massive opportunity. It's going to require though, new insight and new innovation, evolution beyond what our industry has done; beyond what we have done. And that's why back to a wider combination? What's it all about? It's about being able to address some of these types of these issues' climate is one, cyber, it's another one that's still underdeveloped substantially, intellectual property. So all these fit in this category fill around massive unmet client needs that is growing over time that we've got to bring solutions toward and so all these categories to us points of substantial opportunity.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: Just wanted to say to everyone, thanks so much for joining us this quarter. We look forward to our discussion in next quarter. Have a great day.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc’s Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2020 results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc.
Greg Case: Thanks very much and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I am joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO, and Eric Andersen, our President. Like in previous quarters we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We'd like to begin by thanking our Aon colleagues for their extraordinary focus and dedication in supporting clients and each other. What they do every day is exceptional; whether it's building strong lasting relationships with clients as we help them navigate these complex times by the way Aon colleagues come together to collaborate and innovate in ways that are helping us build an even stronger firm; really tremendous work by the Aon team around the world. Turning to our performance. In the third quarter we delivered strong results that once again demonstrate the resilience of our business and strength of our analytic services platform. Organic revenue growth was flat overall reflecting strength in the core areas of our portfolio and ongoing to expected pressure in the more discretionary areas. We saw continued strength in reinsurance solutions with 13% organic revenue growth driven by strong net new business generation and double-digit growth in three facultative and capital markets. Commercial risk delivered modest growth of 2% with strength in the core and continued pressure in more discretionary areas. Health solutions growth is 1%, modest growth internationally partially offset by pressure in the U.S. with respect to ongoing headwinds in the global economy and lower employment levels. Retirement Solutions and data analytic services both experienced organic revenue declines as we saw expecting pressure and more discretionary businesses, like human capital travel and events. As we assess our revenue outlook in Q4, the primary theme is continued uncertainty in the global economy. As many governments consider new restriction the response to increases in COVID-19 cases, while government stimulus remains uncertain and evaluating Q4 revenue expectations two points are important. First, given the seasonality of our business we have a larger portion of more discretionary revenue occurring in Q4. So the pressure on organic will be more significance than in prior quarters. For example, areas of construction and transaction liability with incremental risk recognize revenue when shovels hit the ground and deals are closed. As expected we're seeing pressure in the larger investments in the current environment. In addition, organic revenue growth in Q4 last year was exceptional at 7% overall as we highlighted last year this includes double digit growth in transactional liability as well double digit growth in voluntary health benefits. Few areas of the more discretionary portion of our business that are seeking larger in Q4. The second, and importantly we believe these segments are temporary and reflect pressure from current economic conditions. We're confident in the strong underlying fundamentals of our business. Overall revenue basis diversified across the industry and geography and solution lines roughly 80% is now discretionary and other significant portion that renews every year with 95% retention rates on average. From operating standpoint we delivered strong results, including 40 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter to 170 basis points margin expansion year-to-date. 6% EPS growth in the quarter and exceptionally strong free cash flow of $1.9 billion through September up 91% from the same period last year. These results demonstrate to continue resilience of our Aon United strategy focused on working across our solution lines and geographies to bring the best of the firm to clients. Further this strategy continuously evolve in response the client feedback. Over and over our best outcomes come when we listen attentively and deeply understand client challenges. One recent example of this is the partnership with the global market leader and Internet of Thing. Using our clients’ telematics colleagues and commercial risk, human capital and data analytics developed mobility as a service solution that attributes like on-demand car sharing. The forms part of a total rewards program for employees. Our client provided the technology and we provided the insurance solutions that's digitally distributed through our total rewards platform. This enabled the company to offer simple flexible benefits of their workforce that meets their need at the time on tracking and retaining talent in new ways is paramount for their growth. Not only have we co-created a cutting-edge solution, we've also elevated our partnership with this client to a more strategic level working together to innovate for mutual growth. This example of Aon United action also highlights a larger area, clients demand continues to update industry innovation. It's one of the areas we described in our recent innovation white paper [indiscernible] with Willis Towers Watson. Many industry sector face highly specific challenges that lack adequate solutions. As a result we recognized that there's a need in our industry to create more affordable scalable solutions to broaden access to a wider range of recipients. For example, for investing in digital distribution capabilities to efficiently reach areas that aren't well served today highlighted by our capability for the small commercial space. As we've seen across the economy, COVID-19 accelerated digital adoption. Through September premium volume flowing through the couple of platform is up more than three times over last year showing that this new platform is addressing previously on that client demand for more efficient digital client solutions to their risk management needs. As part of our innovation white paper, we identified and prioritized four areas we can more quickly and effectively address because we're combination with Willis Towers Watson further proof that the combination will make us better faster. As outlined in this piece we think about delivering innovation on at least two levels. The first level is about how our business gets better today as we're in more comprehensive solutions to clients. A big part of this is reinforcing our colleague subject matter expertise by industry and geography. Well, with analytic tools that help them provide better solutions to enable clients to make better decisions. We live in that type of innovation in our core business every day and see the opportunity to do even more with the complementary capabilities of Willis Towers Watson. Building on that first level there's a second level in which we bring those comprehensive solutions to net new addressable markets like U.S. mortgage reinsurance and deliver specific insight and analytic driven solutions like Aon client treaty. These newer challenges can't be assessed with historic insight alone. We have some of the capabilities today but will be stronger in combination with Willis Towers Watson and more capable of delivering these solutions at scale. A fantastic example of this second level is a solution we recently developed for a private agricultural technology client rather than issuing equity, they were able to use our intellectual property capital market solution to raise funds through non-diluted debt. Our proprietary industry-defining method evaluation enabled us to value their IP so it was insurable and could be used as collateral for a loan for over a 100 million. While this is another example of how we're driving innovation today we observed that client need and continues to outpace innovation in our industry. We believe that our combination with Willis Towers Watson will be fundamental in helping reverse this negative trend. As we've consistently emphasize, our priority is continue listening to and understanding our clients. We take pride in the strength of our client relationships and we're listening to them more than ever before. We also want to make sure we hear from them regarding the pending combination and we are. Clients from across industries, solution lines and geographies have expressed tremendous support for the pending combination and especially for the opportunities it presents to drive enhanced innovation. Similarly, we're listening to our colleagues and we're hearing that they're incredibly excited about depending domination and what it means in terms of opportunities for them both in what they can bring to their clients and their own growth and professional development. And we continue to see higher colleagues retention year-over-year in total across the term and across geographies and solution lines. In Q2 and Q3 we saw a 39% decline in voluntary turnover year-over-year. Maybe most remarkable our latest survey of how colleagues are feeling about Aon and our mission yield the strongest sentiment in over 10 years. This is a meaningful credit to our people leaders and all of our global colleagues. In summary, our focus on Aon United and on providing innovative solutions for our clients is delivering results today as we manage through challenging times. Equally important our progress and development establishes in a position of strength for long-term growth, which is accelerated substantially in the combination with Willis Towers Watson. With that overview I'd like to turn to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much Greg and good morning everyone. As Greg mentioned, we delivered a solid operational performance in both the quarter and year-to-date despite continuing macroeconomic challenges demonstrating the resiliency of our business and the strength of our Aon United strategy in any economic environment. We remain committed to deliver shareholder value over the long term which we believe will be accelerated by our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson. Similar to last year, my commentary today is more focused on the quarter given differences in the external environment today versus the beginning of the year. I would also note that Q3 is our seasonally smallest quarter. Having said that, we manage our business on a full year basis and target continued progress against our long-term financial metrics. Our third quarter results reflect continued strong performance in challenging economic conditions. Organic revenue was flat highlighted by 13% organic revenue growth in reinsurance solutions and 2% organic revenue growth in commercial resolutions. As I described in Q1 our business has strong fundamentals with roughly 80% being core and 20% relatively more discretionary. As expected, we continue to see larger impacts in the more discretionary portions of our business such as human capital consulting, travel and events, transaction liability and project work across the portfolio which contributed to organic revenue declines in retirement solutions and data analytics services. I would also note the reported revenue continues to be pressured by lower fiduciary investment income as a result of lower interest rates globally representing a decrease of $18 million in the third quarter. Moving to operating performance. We delivered another quarter of improvement demonstrating strong operational discipline as we return to more normalized levels of expense compared to the second quarter. We had strong year-to-date performance and 6% operating income growth, operating margin expansion of 170 basis points and EPS grows at 8%. As I look towards the fourth quarter there's continued macroeconomic uncertainty and as Greg mentioned we see increased revenue pressure in the fourth quarter compared to prior quarters. The most what I communicated last quarter, we expect expenses for the remainder of 2020 to be more consistent with underlying expenses in 2019 excluding adjusted items. It is due in part to an increase in certain discretionary expenses as well as continued target investments in priority areas for long-term growth while maintaining strong operational discipline. While certain areas such as reduced travel and entertainment expenses continue to be a modest tailwinds, we're investing in priority areas such as intellectual properties and [indiscernible] and making necessary operational investments. For instance, investing in tools for colleagues and strong cyber security as we continue working remotely. Finally, as noted in the earnings materials FX had an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.01 in the third quarter and $0.06 year-to-date. At today's rates would expect a $0.02 per share unfavorable impact in Q4.  Turning to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow increases $908 million or 91% to $1.9 billion driven by working capital improvements of which a portion is related to short-term action taken proactively managing liquidity, a decrease in restructuring cash outlays and strong operational improvements. Much of the strength we see in free cash flow comes from our Aon services platform. I would also note that we’re seeing ways in which services allows us to better support colleagues today and make us more resilient in the future. For instance, over time we've increased the amount of standardization across geographies and solution lines in sharing best practices and driving efficiencies. This has enabled us to better manage employee well-being as colleagues can more easily cover for one another allowing our colleagues greater flexibility to take time off to care for their family. We remain very confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through well ladders debt maturity profile. We ended Q3 with approximately $300 million lower total debt compared to the end of Q2 due in part to paying down substantial amount for commercial paper in the third quarter. Historically, we’ve looked to increase debt at EBITDA growth while maintaining leverage ratios. However, due to the uncertain microeconomic conditions we expect to continue to manage our leverage ratios conservatively in the near future. We are diligent and that's about maximizing return on invested capital and make capital allocation decisions for this framework. Share repurchase remains the highest return on capital investment today given our free cash flow valuation and outlook highlighted by the 500 million of share repurchase in the quarter and nearly a billion dollar year-to-date. We will continue to repurchase shares while maintaining higher than normal levels with cash for the near future given macroeconomic uncertainties. Stepping back, I want to take a moment to reflect on our pending combination with Willis Tower Watson and reiterate how excited we are about the significant shareholder value creation potential. First as Greg described, we see ongoing opportunities for revenue growth as we bring together these highly complementary businesses. Historically, Aon has driven growth in three key areas driving continued improvement in our core business, portfolio mix shift for high growth areas and unlocking net new opportunities that expand our total addressable market. As Greg mentioned, COVID-19 has highlighted the reality that our clients have growing and unmet needs across risk retirement and health with the combination with Willis Tower Watson positions us to address well. As we've said we remain committed to be $800 million of expected cost synergies. I would note that we expect these synergies on top of core module expansions for both firms and while we see a significant nature in macroeconomic uncertainty we're very confident now long term strategy to drive margin expansion. We've said before that our margin expansion is driven by accelerating revenue growth, portfolio mix shift for high growth high margin businesses and leverage for Aon business services operational platform. In particular we're confident the investments we've made in our Aon business service platform will enable us to capture our expected synergies and continue to drive long-term operating margin expansion for the combined firm. I've noted that over the last decade we have driven 70 to 80 basis points of margin expansion on average each year. So it's some year higher, some lower. So we run the firm on a cash basis. We've demonstrated a strong track record of driving efficiencies and growth in areas such as working capital and CapEx. We're confident the investments we've made in Aon business services will create even more opportunities to grow free cash flow as we look forward to the pending combination with Willis Tower Watson. Looking back to our deal announcement on March 9, we couldn't build the accretive to Aon EPS [indiscernible] free cash flow in year two and significantly accretive to free cash flow in year three. Given macroeconomic uncertainty due to COVID-19, we've since withdrawn our financial guidance of mid-single digital greater organic revenue growth and double digit free cash flow growth which were key assumptions of the projections upon which we calculated accretion. We are not reissuing financial projections at this time given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. However, the primary drivers of the accretion that we provided were the $800 million of synergies and our capital allocation strategy. We remain committed to the $800 million of synergies and while we took action to proactively manage liquidity earlier this year we resumed share repurchase in the third quarter and continue to buy back shares. I would note that mathematically the same amount of synergies on a smaller baseline of EPS would be more accretive. We are confident that the $800 million of synergies, our focus on driving free cash flow and our discipline capital allocation strategy will lead to meaningful shareholder value creation. Finally, as we continue to make progress against our key milestones receiving shareholder approval from both sets of shareholders on August 26th with 99% approval from Aon shareholders and 96% from Willis Tower Watson shareholders we remain on track to close the deal in the first half of 2021. In summary, our business has shown resiliency despite continued macroeconomic challenges. Our Aon United Strategy underpinned by our Aon business services operational platform have enabled expense discipline and strong free cash flow growth while positioning us for long-term growth. Our discipline approach to return on invested capital provides financial flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term. We're incredibly excited about the pending combination with Willis Tower Watson. With that I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions. 
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Dave Styblo, Jefferies. Your line is now open. 
Dave Styblo: Hi, good morning. Each of the questions and the color about 4Q about to just start with that one and get a better sense of what are the areas that have the most exposure to the economic weakness right now and is there any way that you can provide some general book ends around how much organic pressure there will be in the fourth quarter? Are we thinking something like mid-single digits would be appropriate or there or is there just that much more discretionary spend that happened there where the pressure could be more than that?
Greg Case: Dave what I tried to highlight the start of [indiscernible] reinforce I think is listen overall when we think about revenue going forward nothing's really changed except this unusual year. This unusual year is all about uncertainty and we were trying to highlight as you think about Q4 there's just a lot of uncertainty. There is uncertainty on sort of what's going on, how COVID is going to evolve, the reaction of government, the reaction of clients, colleagues across Aon have done a remarkable job just an incredible job through the first nine months and we are supporting each other and clients. But when you think about Q4 for us the pressure we described and the pressure is real is really it's because of the disproportionate amount of what we do are discretionary part of overall book happened to Q4. So this is to describe before like M&A services, voluntary benefits things like that they just happen to happen to be in Q4 and it's an uncertain environment so those the actions have to happen. We're very confident they're going to happen over time whether they happen in Q4 or not really is the question. The second piece is, you saw Q4 last year was just exceptionally strong. Now we make no apologies for that. We're incredibly excited about that but it was exceptionally strong double digit in number of these discretionary areas which is where we are. Then there are aspects of our core business as we said before like traveling events that are still under pressure and they're going to be back and stronger than ever before. We're very confident of it but it's a lot of uncertainty is sort of we move into the year. We do want to highlight though as you think about the overall profile that Christa described growth, profitability, EPS, free cash flow that profile hasn't changed at all as we think about Q4. Christa is there anything you would add to that? 
Christa Davies: Greg, I might just finish with as we think about our business we really manage it over the course Dave of a full year and we certainly expect to grow margins over the course of 2020. We expect to grow EPS and we have an extremely strong free cash flow outlook and I think while there's pressure for sure in Q4 on revenue and therefore on margins we expect to continue to grow in 2021 and continue to manage all four of those metrics; revenue, margins, EPS and free cash flow over the course of the year. 
Dave Styblo: Helpful, thanks and then I'm sure it's tough to a pine on next year, but assuming we get back a little bit more of a normalized environment organic growth still might be soft. Is there some sort of rust threshold where it gets hard to expand margins and obviously you could tell the curtail those back at the expenses perhaps longer term revenue growth but how do you think about that balance for next year if growth is sort of both below the 3% to 5% range that many insurance brokers are at?
Christa Davies: Yes, Dave we do expect to grow margins next year. If you looked at 2020 margins an example we expect to grow margins and 2020 and we're up 170 basis points year-to-date. Long-term our goal to drive margin expansion each year as evidenced by our record 27.5% margins in 2019 up 250 basis points on top of ten years of margin expansion with 70 to 80 basis points each year net of ongoing investment in the business and we would say a long-term margin expansion is driven by revenue growth, our portfolio mix shift hire both higher margin areas and Aon business services driving productivity. And we believe, we have got substantial opportunity for margin expansion with the combination of Willis Tower Watson number one and growing a Aon core margin number two growing Willis Tower Watson margins and number three adding on the 800 million of synergies, which we are very confident delivering.
Greg Case: And even Dave, you think about sort of the overall economy which seconds or how it struggles to evolve over time I just also want to remind you on top of and I really say on top of what Christa just described we can consider the broad-based risk that are no longer on the rise of in our face and like pandemic, climate change, intellectual property all the things we outlined in our white paper that John described so well on the call yesterday and Willis Tower Watson. These are things that are real. They are in front of us. They're going to create demand over time because clients got to find ways to address these _. So on top of all Christa described that's what we're really excited about the combination being able to address.
Dave Styblo: Helpful. Thanks much. 
Operator: The next question is from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. 
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question just in terms of the merger with Willis Tower Watson. I was hoping you could provide us an update just in terms of timing, I guess first half of next year. I'm assuming obviously that still holds but I guess more in terms of just like it's the regulatory process where we stand today in terms of kind of the timeline you guys expected when you put the deal together just given it seems like COVID in some instances just falling things down just want to kind of get an update and see anything they're still on track and where we stand over in different perspective?
Christa Davies: Terrific. Thanks for the question Elyse. We do believe we're exactly on track to close in the first half of 2021. We filed our joint definitive proxy on Wednesday, July 8th and completed the share with overwhelming support on August 26 with 99% of Aon share we sighted for a 96% of Willis Tower Watson share is voting for. We do not expect to provide update to the regulatory process unless we have something to report. As John Haley mentioned on the Willis Tower Watson's earning call yesterday several global antitrust filing be required in connection with the closed transaction the specific planning process and timing varies by jurisdiction, and we do not expect to provide updates until we have something to report. But as we've previously indicated we are on track and expect to be able to close in the first half of 2021.
Eric Andersen: Christa, maybe a fallow-on at around how we're doing with the integration process because I think it's pretty important. We've actually done a lot of work around the culture of the firm's understanding how each of the firm's operates through the client centricity, the capabilities of each of the terms have the so complementary and we've been using this period of time really to focus on getting to know each other trying to figure out how do we work better together as Greg mentioned on the white paper finding those opportunities. So while that regulatory process is going on we've been spending an awful lot of time setting up and doing the planning about how we're going to come together. 
Elyse Greenspan: Great and then in terms of organic growth, going back to the color in terms of the greater discretionary piece in the fourth quarter. You guys said, you expect I am guessing to slow in the Q4, the Q3 was obviously better than the Q2 what was the point you're trying to make is that the fourth quarter would be like the weakest of the year or just slow down sequentially versus the Q3. I wasn't sure if there was a lot of value were also trying to make it at me reference that to like the second quarter which I guess was the lowest so far that you have seen during this slow down.
Greg Case: Yes.The highlight it. This is about this is truly uncertainty. We are observing by the way the pressure that we described which is real is as Christa described before 80% in scored 90% discretionary but 20% disproportionately for us shows up in Q4 and at 20% are things like M&A services. We have an awesome business here wonderful support for clients but if shovels don't go in the ground that doesn't happen eventually it happens but it's it builds the business over time over the coming years we're not talking about the category. It's great but in Q4 it's about uncertainty where it is same is true on some of the health businesses we described travel, events, etc. So we're just highlighting there's a lot of uncertainty in Q4. No one really knows well if anybody out there knows please call us. We'd like to know exactly what's going on but our colleagues have just done a masterful job being ready for clients to move and modify and shape, help them shape their strategies but we just have a huge amount of uncertainty sort of in terms of Q4 with growth in 2021 and all the things that Christa described nothing has changed in our overall growth profile on what we expect long term.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Great and then just one last one Chris I think last quarter you had mentioned that you guys were returning to buybacks and I think you used the word modest correct me if I'm wrong and so you guys bought back 500 million of your stock in just one month in the quarter which was pretty healthy level. Can you just help us think about buybacks like the levels from here given that it was a pretty robust return to buyback when you guys went back into the market in the third quarter?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much Elyse. Look in response to macroeconomic certainty we did pull buyback March in order to maintain liquidity, stability and flexibility and then we did announce last quarter we resume a limited amount of buyback for the remainder of the year. We're not giving guidance about capital allocation going full but we'll assess it based on actual forecasted cash flow as well as capital market conditions. And so, what you did see Elyse is exceptionally strong free cash flow stunning in the first nine months of the year up 91% to $1.9 billion but the macro uncertainty remains and so what you'll see is we continue to allocate cash based on return on capital, cash on cash return and buyback remains the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon even at Aon's peak valuation or peak stock price and so at today's prices it is a fantastic return on capital opportunity and so we will continue buyback but it'll be based on the cash we generate and capital market conditions.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the color. 
Operator: The next question is from Jimmy Bhullar, JPMorgan. Your line is now open. 
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi good morning. I had a couple of questions both on the Willis deal, first there's a lot of skepticism out there about your comments on not really having a lot of revenue synergies as you go through the regulatory approval process and the potential for you being forced to sell parts of the Willis business or parts of the combined business. Can you discuss what gives you confidence that that won't be the case and then related on your expense savings targets if we look at the $800 million number that's I think close to roughly 5% of the cost base and in past deals you've done a lot more than even 10% and I would have thought that given the similarities between the two companies you'd actually potentially be able to do more so maybe talk about if there's any conservatism baked into your numbers or are there things that you see that are causing you to be more cautious on expense savings.
Christa Davies: Sure Jimmy. So I'll take the first one on antitrust. So we do believe we're on track to close in the first half of 2021 as I said with no divestitures and the reason we're so confident about that is because we have the world's leading antitrust council. We've had them for more than 18 months. We've worked through this in detail and we believe we have highly complementary businesses and even in areas like reinsurance which I know has been speculated upon Jimmy, we look at that business and we think about it from a client perspective and clients have a huge range of choices. If you think about the client for reinsurance it's an insurer and they can place direct which a lot of them do. They can place um in the capital markets through alternative capital. They can place during [indiscernible] and they can place through a huge range of brokers including a number of broker startups given the significant movement of talent in the reinsurance industry and so we look at that incredibly competitive field and we do see that there is enormous competition from a client choice perspective and so again we feel really confident about where we are and exactly on track to closing the first half of 2021 with no divestitures. Then moving to your second question sorry Greg did you want to jump in?
Greg Case: No, please go ahead. I will pick up when you are done.
Christa Davies: Your second on cost synergies. So we did announce 800 million of cost synergies which as you pointed out Jimmy is 5.5% of the combined cost base and we did achieve 11% of the combined cost space in Aon Hewitt and 18% of the combined cost base in Aon and what I think that tells you Jimmy is, we are extremely confident about achieving the 800 million. What it also tells you Jimmy is, really the main strategic focus of the combination with Willis Tower Watson is on revenue and on delivering on these new solutions for clients to meet unmet client needs and really we want to make sure that as we bring the combination together we're really absolutely laser focused on clients and driving that significant upside in terms of revenue potential as opposed to completely distracted by taking costs up but Greg what would you say? 
Greg Case: I think the stat you added the piece two aspects of it Jimmy very important question. One just when you think about talent and I think you're asking about talent in addition to just the antitrust fees ask yourself as we come together our colleagues are going to able to sit across the table from clients with more capabilities for clients that's a wonderfully positive thing and that's what we want to try to do that's what we're focused on. Eric, in his work with his colleagues at Willis Tower Watson and others are really working on sort of how that calling value proposition comes together to make it more compelling. This is not about synergy. It's about literally net new and that then fits on the client side and if you step back and think about there's been a 30 year period when you think about risk as a percent of GDP where it's gotten less significant we're becoming less significant as an industry that's what the facts tell us. And by the way at a time when client need is going up and then that's become even more pronounced during pandemic and so again this is what the white paper was about and as we begin to think about addressing those opportunities that's why this is about growth that's why this is -- there will be synergies of course you bring two firms together but this is about growth addressing some of the most significant risks in the world today that are unaddressed literally unaddressed pandemic, climate, intellectual property even cyber relatively less addressed. And in the end it's a real opportunity in terms of sort of where we are and what we're trying to do and there's lots of opportunities out there as you think about sort of where we are in specific events that are happening every day. But in the end this is really about client opportunity and creating net new as part of this combination. 
Eric Andersen: Yes Greg, maybe to pick up on it just to pick up on it for a second because I do think our Aon United Strategy which we've been working on for several years around how we integrate around the client bringing all the capabilities whether it's bringing reinsurance modeling to property clients on our commercial risk side there's a hundred of these examples that are out there. Willis Tower Watson has very similar client focused and efforts underway and so when you bring those together as Christa said this is all about finding new ways to serve our existing clients to do more for them and I think the excitement that's building both from an Aon and the Willis Tower Watson inside it's really starting to come together as people start to see the possibilities.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay and just lastly on the health business you saw a noticeable improvement in your organic growth on 1%, but last quarter was down double digits. I think in the release there's a mention about some timing of booking revenues. Is the majority the improvement just because of that or I don't know what extent you can quantify it or was there underlying improvement in the business as well versus 2Q?
Greg Case: Yes. Well similar as we said in our last discussion really this is the space we absolutely love the overall opportunity and health we think is tremendous coming into 2020 and as you well know Jimmy has become even more pronounced you think about everything that's happening with the pandemic. It's now literally in every border and every company around the world and our opportunity to support clients here is tremendous. So we love this long term and we love it even in the short term and what you saw in Q3 was just continued progression. There is still a lot of uncertainty, still a lot of discretionary uh events happen in the fourth quarter as it relates to health particularly in the U.S. but we love this space long term and the team has done a great job we are really looking forward to kind of seeing this business grow and progress.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thanks.
Operator: Suneet Kamath, Citi.
Suneet Kamath: Yes. Good morning. First I want to go [audio gap] and I think you said something along the lines of spreading the [audio gap] so my question is were buybacks not contemplated in your origin [audio gap].
Christa Davies: So Suneet actually what I said was if you think about the 800 million of synergies so if you think about the accretion it was really based on two things. It was based on the 800 million of synergies and it was based on a capital allocation. [Audio gap] 800 million and [Audio gap] quarter and continue to buy that shares and so if you think about accretion mathematically if you think about the original accretion assumptions on a smaller EPS base then it would be more accretive today.
Suneet Kamath: Okay got it and then I guess on the deal in terms of regulatory reviews and approvals how might a change in the presidential administration impact the timing of the close as we think about potential changes at the DOJ or elsewhere? 
Christa Davies: Suneet we will see any impact should there be a change in administration especially given the timeline may expect the deal. 
Suneet Kamath: Okay and then my last question is just on margin looking out over time Christa you mentioned a couple times the 70 to 80 basis points of margin expansion annually and you still feel pretty good about the path going forward but as we think about margins in the future is there any way to frame for how much longer you guys think that you can continue to improve margins be it at that 70 to 80 basis point range or something in that neighborhood? So when does this sort of tailwind start to peak or drop off? Thanks.
Christa Davies: Suneet thanks so much for the question because long term our goal is to continue to drive margin expansion this year. We do not see some cap on margins. In fact we continue to see margin expansion for the foreseeable future. And it's really driven by revenue growth, our portfolio mix shift to higher revenue growth higher margin areas and Aon business services continuing to drive productivity. We obviously see substantial margin expansion with the combination of Willis Tower Watson because you get Aon core margin expansion plus Willis Tower Watson margin expansion plus the synergies and as we look at our portfolio today the portions that are more analytic in nature tend to be higher margin areas of the portfolio and so that gives us confidence going forward that we'll continue to have long-term margin expansion.
Greg Case: And so on top of that Suneet, if you think you think about what Christa just described if just painted a picture over the coming years literally all the pieces are in place for margin expansion. We think about Aon business services and the capabilities the next incarnation of that called the new way Aon business services as we bring the firms together sort of in the new world here the opportunity over the next few years that's in place and there's tremendous opportunity for Aon by itself, Willis Tower Watson by itself and for the combination and that's we're pretty excited about that. But beyond that if you go to the innovation white paper for just a minute and ask a question there are issues that must be addressed. Client need is going up. As we address those issues they're going to be done with analytics and capability so that we're building over time. That analytics gives us a margin profile that's different than it has been before. If you look at other analytics businesses their margin profile and their growth is much more substantial than ours are. So there's the ceiling you're describing it's a great question but we don't see that at all. In fact, because we have all what we do and we help our colleagues because it really is about our colleagues more than any time ever about our colleague we're truly supporting them with greater levels of analytics that help us address these questions. This outcome great for our clients, great for our colleagues happens to be exceptionally good for our shareholders as well in terms of where we are. So that's why we're so excited about the investment and the combination to address this next level of issues that are out there and no longer on the horizon. They are at our doorstep with a higher awareness than ever before to address them.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. Thanks for the answers. 
Operator: Our last question is from Phil Stephano, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. 
Phil Stephano: Yes. Thanks and good morning. I had another question on margins and thinking more about this in the next year or two I was hoping you could help me think about the competing forces of when we return to a normal world of growth and a normal world of expenses does the potential for margin expansion in one particular year have natural pressures from a return of normal expenses? 
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question and what we would say is we expect to continue to drive margin expansion each year including if you thought about returning to a normalized environment, you'd add expenses back as revenue came back and so we'd be very disciplined about making sure that occurred but if you think about the new better operating model where we're consulting with clients about today in terms of the work coalition you can think about sort of areas like long term, lower real estate costs, more service delivery centers and ongoing Aon business services providing productivity improvements over time. And so there are many areas in which we think the opportunity for margin expansion continues to accelerate.
Phil Stephano: Okay. Understood. A quick numbers question reinsurance the organic in the year was a bit strong and one of the things that was noted was a timing benefit. Can you just help us understand what the timing benefit was and when it was from? 
Eric Andersen: So this is Eric. I would say it was pretty minor. The reinsurance business continues to be great on a full year basis but we're obviously in the third and fourth quarter are the smallest quarters for us because most of the treaty business is done. It's now facultative and any kind of investment banking work that gets done. So I would say was pretty immaterial.
Phil Stephano: Okay and then the last one just philosophically thinking about sharing repurchases versus the uncertainty that's come up a lot of times on this call for the next year or two how do you think about of the uncertainty and get comfortable with the fact that at least third quarter was a strong quarter with repurchases that is the right action to take just given the uncertainty that you have? 
Christa Davies: Thank you so much because we are managing cash and liquidity incredibly conservatively. You can see that as we built up cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet you can see it because we decreased debt by 300 million between end of Q2 and end of Q3. You can see it because we've got a very conservative debt ladder long-term for the firm and so we're being very conservative in response to macroeconomic and therefore, go jump in Greg. 
Greg Case: Go ahead Christa. No problem.
Christa Davies: And so, what we see is we're managing this based on our free cash flow which is exceptionally strong I mean free cash flow up 908 million years-to-date up 91% and then obviously the return on capital opportunity of share a purchase is exceptional and it was exceptional at peak stock price levels for Aon and at today's prices is just a stunning return to shareholders and so for us we'll continue to manage liquidity incredibly conservatively and then we'll continue to invest based on return on capital cash on cash returns as we think about the firm but Greg please jump in. 
Greg Case: Yes and I'm just trying to put you if you think about this in context of our overall strategy and what we're doing like Christa describing literally the discipline and the approach we've taken in managing our balance sheet and driving free cash flow and that has been exceptional and it continues to be exceptional and we have the capacity to do a lot as we invest in the business as we do share buyback and anything that sort of drives return on invested capital and ultimately free cash flow over time but I would highlight you're seeing the buyback. Again we have capacity to do a lot but the example that I described around intellectual property isn't example we're investing in the core business and really doing things from an innovation standpoint. The loan we made the investment to do that took hundreds and hundreds of colleagues coming together to model intellectual property in ways that's never been modeled before, literally never been modeled before in a way that we could actually insure a patent portfolio and then get a loan against the patent portfolio and so we're making lots of investment in the businesses sort of as we build it over time. I love the example that John gave yesterday John Haley on the climate so we're investing we see this as one of the next big horizon around how we help clients think about the transition from in a challenged world and we can help reduce volatility against that by matching capital with risk and fundamentally this is what we're talking about and the beauty of it is from a cash standpoint we have an exceptionally strong balance sheet, exceptionally strong free cash flow which will be reinforced as we come together in the combination that allows us to actually do the things that Christa described allocate capital to improve the capital buyback shares Obviously, makes sense for all the reasons Christa describe but also invest in the business and bring in additional capability as needed. So we're you say cash it is the thing we live every day. We focus on in terms of what we're trying to do and we're working to strengthen to build that over time. 
Phil Stephano: Got it. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: I just want to say to everyone as always thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it and look forward to our conversation next quarter. Thanks very much. 
Operator: That concludes the conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-31 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc’s Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2020 results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc.
Greg Case: Thanks very much and good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I am joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO, and Eric Andersen, our President. Like in previous quarters we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.  To begin, I want to thank our global team for their extraordinary leadership and responding to the on-going challenges presented by COVID-19. Even as the vast majority of our workforce continue to work remotely, their innovation, connectivity and engagement in support of our clients and each other is truly exceptional. And we see that engagement colleague feedback most recently in the near 90% approval rating of our response to the pandemic. Consistent with that sentiment, colleague retention is up across the organization. Further, our firm’s response to more recent and fundamental issues of social injustice and inclusion had been resolute and inspiring. Our global team is committed to structural change that is meaningful and lasting, change that will make us a better and more inclusive firm. We view progress on this front as central to our future and are taking action fully reflecting this priority. Turning to our second quarter results, for Aon overall, organic revenue declined 1%, an outcome that demonstrates great work by our team and resilience of our business in the face of unprecedented challenges in the global economy. In particular, I'd like to highlight 9% organic revenue growth and reinsurance solutions, driven by net new business generation in trading and double-digit growth in facultative placements. These results demonstrate the team's seamless transition to the new working environment and their focus on meeting evolving client needs. Within commercial risk 1% organic revenue growth was driven by strong retention across most major geographies, and particular strength in core property and casualty, partially offset by impact in more discretionary areas of the portfolio, such as transaction liability, construction and project work. Retirement solutions declined 1% in organic revenue reflecting solid growth in investments, ability in retirement and pressure in the more discretionary aspects of our business, especially human capital. Two areas of particular challenge for the quarter were health solutions and data analytic services. We expect the short term headwinds impacting results in both areas will reverse over time, and health solutions which declined 18% in the quarter, two issues were evident. First, pressure in both core and more discretionary areas of our business, primarily driven by a decline in employment levels related to COVID-19 and the timing of certain revenue. And second, a one- time adjustment representing approximately 5% of the decline, which was identified with the implementation of a new system. This will not repeat in future periods. Overall, our performance in health solutions reflects the pressure of the COVID-19 challenge, but also highlights the long term importance and priority of this solution line for our clients. In data analytic services, which declined 8% results were driven primarily by an expected decline in our travel and events practice. We expect this to bounce back strongly when the economy returns to a more normal performance level. In terms of overall organic revenue expectations for Q3 and Q4, the outlook is obviously uncertain. If macroeconomic conditions persist, we expect to see on-going firm wide revenues pressures similar to what we observed in Q2. From an operating standpoint, we delivered strong results, including 240 basis points of operating margin expansion, 5% EPS growth, and exceptionally strong free cash flow of $1.1 billion through June, up $875 million from the first half of last year. It's important to highlight that while this performance reinforces confidence in our Aon United strategy in any economic environment, we do see on-going macroeconomic pressures from trends in GDP growth, asset values and employment among others. We continue to prepare for a broad range of economic scenarios, but we believe the probabilities of absolute worst case scenarios assessed in early March have diminished. This reduced probability is what gave us the confidence to restore and repay our temporary salary reductions for colleagues, with a bonus on withheld around. In this time of adversity on so many fronts, our colleagues are continuing to find innovative ways to bring Aon United solutions to pressing client needs. For example, one client, the facilities management and energy services company, has been facing substantial challenge related to the current economic conditions. Colleagues from Commercial Risk, Data & Analytics and Human Capital came together to collectively help this company navigate short-term headwinds, while also strengthening their operational efficiency and overall resilience. One of their biggest challenges was the cost of operating and maintaining their fleet. Our team designed a new solution for risk management and talent assessment, designed to reduce fuel and insurance costs while enhancing driver safety, an outcome that's solves our client’s top priorities. The issues faced by clients today demonstrate that our economy is unprepared for complex and interconnected challenges fully demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking forward, there are other, long tail risks on the horizon. As climate changes, population ages, and the wealth gap continues to widen, volatility will increase. Our global risk survey highlights that of the top 10 risks our clients face, only one is fully insured, four are partially insured and five are not insured at all. The mandate is clear. We must innovate faster to provide answers to these growing areas of client demand. For Aon, our path forward to increase innovation and support clients is clear. Our Aon United blueprint provides a proven roadmap and the combination with Willis Towers Watson will substantially accelerate progress. Together we’ll be better for our clients on day one, driven by the complementary nature of our core businesses across solution lines and geographies, and will be better in the future driven by a shared commitment to analytics and increased ability to unlock new sources of value for our clients. We’ve been saying for some time that the world is becoming more volatile economically, demographically, geopolitically. And the events of the last 100 days only underscore that reality. They also raised the stakes for Aon United mission on the goal of bringing the best of our firm to clients. At a time when our clients need us most, the combination with Willis Towers Watson further strengthens our client-serving capability and puts us in a position to best address their unmet needs, those that they turn to us for today and the emerging needs best met by the next-generation professional services firm that we’re bringing together. In summary, we delivered strong operational results in the quarter and remain well positioned to manage through and accelerate out of these challenging times. Despite the pandemic, we’re becoming a more capable organization and one that will be further advanced in combination with Willis Towers Watson. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Christa for further Financial Review, Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg and good morning everyone. As Greg mentioned, we delivered a solid operational performance in both the quarter and year-to-date, despite significant macroeconomic challenges, demonstrating the resiliency of our business and the strength of our Aon United strategy in any economic environment. The steps we’ve taken to proactively and conservatively manage discretionary expenses and liquidity have enabled us to maintain financial stability and flexibility. This conservatism makes us resilient through these challenging times and positions us to come out stronger. We remain committed to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term, which we believe will be accelerated by our combination with Willis Towers Watson. As I discuss our results today, I would note that while we manage our business on a full year basis and typically focus on year-to-date numbers, my commentary today is somewhat more focused on the quarter especially given the differences in the external environment in Q1 and Q2 and how that impacted our decisions, results and outlook. Our second quarter results reflect the strong performance in challenging economic conditions. Organic revenue declined by 1%, with 9% organic revenue growth in Reinsurance and 1% organic revenue growth in Commercial Risk Solutions. As I described last quarter, our business has strong fundamentals with roughly 80% being core and 20% relatively more discretionary. As expected, we did see larger and more immediate impact on the more discretionary portions of our business, which contributed to organic revenue declines in Retirement Solutions, Health Solutions and Data & Analytic Services. I would also note that reported revenue was pressured by FX as well as lower fiduciary investment income as a result of lower interest rates globally. As I look toward the rest of the year, as Greg mentioned, we remain confident in the underlying resilience of our business. However, given continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we are not providing specific financial guidance at this time. In terms of organic revenue expectations for Q3 and Q4, the outlook is obviously uncertain. If current macroeconomic conditions persist, we would expect to see on-going firm wide revenue pressures similar to what we observed in Q2. Moving to operational performance. For the first half of 2020, we delivered solid operating improvements with 7% OI growth, operating margin expansion of 230 basis points and EPS growth of 9%. I would note that while operational improvement in the first quarter includes strong organic revenue growth, improvement in the second quarter includes the temporary reduction of discretionary expenses including reduced travel and events, which does not reflect sustainable core operating margin expansion. As Greg mentioned, we’re still preparing for a broad range of outcomes. However, we do see a decreased likelihood of worst-case scenarios. While operating margins have improved 230 basis points for the first half of the year, due in part to the pre-emptive and temporary expense actions we took to decrease underlying expenses as compared to the prior year, we expect operating expenses in the second half of 2020 to be more consistent with underlying expenses in the second half of 2019 excluding restructuring charges. This represents a difference from Q2 as we return to more normalized levels of spend in the face of reduced likelihood of worst case macroeconomic scenarios. We expect that the second half of the year will include very targeted investment in priority areas while maintaining strong operational discipline. Finally, as noted in our earnings material, FX was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.01 in the second quarter and $0.05 year-to-date. At today’s rates, we would expect a $0.02 per share unfavorable impact in each of Q3 and Q4. Overall, we’re confident the investments we’ve made in our Aon Business Services operating platform enable us to continue to manage costs in the near term and to unlock significant operational leverage over the long term. Aon Business Services enables our ability to distribute content and capabilities across the firm to drive long-term growth and free cash flow. Turning to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow increased $875 million to $1.1 billion, driven by strong operational improvement, the impact of temporary salary reductions, near-term actions we’ve taken to improve working capital and a decrease in restructuring cash outlays. I would note that the impact of temporary salary reductions were reflected in the income statement in Q2 but the withheld amount will be paid and impact cash flow in Q3. As the world moved to working remotely, our ability to centrally manage invoicing, cash collections and vendor payments has been essential. And this environment has served to accelerate the transition to digital, which can help ensure we’re able to focus on driving free cash flow growth. We remain very confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well laddered [ph] debt maturity profile. We further improved liquidity in the second quarter, issuing $1 billion of debt, of which $600 million was used to pay down term debt coming due in September 2020. We ended Q2 with $100 million lower total debt compared to the end of Q1. Historically, we’ve looked to increase debt as EBITDA grows while maintaining leverage ratios. However, due to current macroeconomic conditions, we expect to continue to manage our leverage ratios conservatively in the near future. We are diligent about maximizing return on invested capital and make capital allocation decisions through this framework. While we posed [ph] certain discretionary uses of cash in the first quarter, we are considering resuming limited share buyback in the second half of the year, subject to macroeconomic conditions, business performance and the timing restrictions related to our combination with Willis Towers Watson. We are likely to maintain higher than normal levels of cash for the near future given macroeconomic uncertainty. As we’ve said before, we are committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating following the combination with Willis Towers Watson and continue to make progress against our key milestones. We filed our joint definitive proxy earlier this month and look forward to the vote from both company’s shareholders on August 26. We expect the deal to close in the first half of 2021 as we’ve previously communicated. In summary, our business is stable and resilient in the face of macroeconomic challenges. The historic steps we’ve taken to drive our Aon United strategy and especially our Aon Business Services operational platform are more important now than ever. Our disciplined approach to return on invested capital provides financial flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to the operator and we’d be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Suneet Kamath of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to start with the merger. In the past, you guys were confident that you wouldn’t need to divest any businesses. I just want to first confirm is that still your view?
Greg Case: That is in fact…
Christa Davies: Yes, it is.
Suneet Kamath: Okay, great. And then related. Go ahead, Christa. Sorry.
Christa Davies: Sorry. So yes, that's exactly our view. We remain exactly on track to the overall merger. We’re very excited about it and frankly, more excited today than when we announced it on March 9. And we expect to close in 2021 with no divestitures.
Suneet Kamath: And so relatedly, I just I’m trying to reconcile your confidence with some industry commentary we’re getting and some investor concerns particularly on the reinsurance business. So if you could provide just some color on why you're so confident with respect to that business in particular.
Christa Davies: Sure. So we have had excellent antitrust council for globally for quite some period of time as you can see from the proxy detail about the background to the merger. And therefore, we feel very confident about our antitrust approval. In Reinsurance in particular, those businesses are highly complementary. If I took the U.S. as an example, we’re very strong on property. Willis Towers Watson is very strong in other areas. For example, in we’re very strong in large market. They are very strong in middle market. So it’s actually a highly complementary business. And so we feel really good about our ability to close the transaction with no divestitures, including Reinsurance.
Greg Case: Christa, maybe if I could just add a couple of comments as well about the reinsurance market and the way clients access capital. Brokers are only one way with which they do it. There is a very large direct market, whether especially in Europe as well as in the U.S., where the insurers actually go to many reinsurers directly. They also raise money through sidecars. So their access to capital is actually largely done outside the brokerage business as opposed to within the brokerage business. So when you actually look at the entire marketplace, it’s actually the way people tend to look at it within the industry, I think, really is not the correct way to do it.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. And then just my last related question is just what kind of feedback have you gotten from your customers? Since the merger announcement obviously, it’s been several months now, particularly on the on the brokerage side, but also on the reinsurance side?
Greg Case: Love the question, Suneet. Listen, we would suggest by the way, any discussion of the combination of Willis Towers Watson got to begin and end with the only topic that really matters, and that’s the one you are raising, which is clients. It’s really all about value for clients. I will tell you, from the orientation from the start John Haley and I talk all the time about a guiding aspiration that is very clear and straightforward. We view this combination as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change the innovation trajectory for clients, and it’s really Suneet set a new standard for client leadership and impact. That’s really our focus. How do we get better faster? How do we address unmet client needs? And I will tell you, since the announcement in March, I have talked to literally hundreds of clients about their needs and how they’ve evolved and how they’re shifting over time. And I’ll tell you, I’ve heard from many of them fundamentally reordered client priorities in a way never really seen in history. They realize they need to solve not only for both what’s going on today, the operating challenges today, but also the long-tail challenges that could shut them down in the future tomorrow. And they are literally turning to us and asking the question, how do we partner with them to prepare for the next pandemic? How do we best protect and value [technical difficulty] is 80-plus percent of their value and we really haven’t addressed as an industry over time? How do we mitigate this systemic impact on climate change, model the impact of widespread cyber outages or address things like the health/wealth gap? So point is our clients are asking for more choice. They don’t have a choice on these now that is a meaningful choice for them. And this integrated client driven approach that we’re describing really defines our Aon United strategy. And I will tell you it reflects very similar aspirations John Haley has for the Willis Towers Watson team. It’s been remarkable to see. And our combination with Willis Towers Watson is the catalyst that advances our ability to meet client need. And last thing I would say on this one, Suneet, is it’s just such an important question and the way you asked it is exactly right, which is client-focused. I’m just reflecting on one of the hundreds of conversations, sitting down with one client. And they summarized it best back for me because we went through all the things they were facing. And they said straight up, When I look at what I need, that is the client talking to me, what I need from all of you and what’s out there now in your industry, fundamentally, this combination is about more choice, more relevant and essential choice. I don't have it now, and this gives me the opportunity to have that. So our response has been exceptionally positive.
Suneet Kamath: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, if I look at the slide that you guys provided on the merger, you the accretion related bullets are missing from what you had last quarter. I did see that it was in the most recent proxy. So I just want to confirm that your goals related to accretion related to EPS and free cash flow that you laid out with the merger still stands today.
Christa Davies: Elyse, thanks so much for the question. So we did commit to $800 million of synergies, and we still expect to deliver those synergies and the cost to achieve them and the timing of those synergies. The accretion dilution was based on underlying EPS estimates. And since then, we have obviously withdrawn guidance given the macroeconomic environment has changed. So we withdrew our financial guidance with mid-single-digit organic growth and double-digit free cash flow growth. But the recent macroeconomic events do not impact the $800 million of cost synergies, and we continue to be incredibly excited about the combination's potential for clients.  As we talked about at the beginning, the strategic rationale for the deal is really around innovation and growth and as Greg talked about earlier, meeting unmet needs for clients, which we believe are substantial. But Greg, you may want to elaborate on that.
Greg Case: I'll just underscore, Elyse. As we came into this with a set of perspectives in March, as Christa highlighted, I'll get Eric to talk to some point around the integration that we’re working on now. Those high expectations have been exceeded. I mean the opportunities that we see for innovation on behalf of clients are greater than ever before. Obviously, all the economic [Indiscernible] Christa highlight are still fully in place. But that opportunity is, we think, very compelling for our clients as they understand it and also very compelling for our colleagues. And again, this is the conversation I have all the time with John Haley. This is two organizations coming together both on a similar journey and see the opportunity now to accelerate that journey dramatically on behalf of clients. So that really is the momentum we feel as we spend time with colleagues at Willis Towers Watson just continues to grow.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, that's helpful. And from the regulatory side of things, are you guys I’m kind of on track with where you thought you would be at this point in time. And does it feel like you might you know, in terms of deal closing, half year one is obviously a big timeframe. Do you have a sense of when we -- when you think when you first, when you finally think you might close the deal? Sorry. Thank you.
Christa Davies: Yes, so Elyse we are exactly on track with our original time period. We filed our joint definitive proxy on Wednesday, July 8. We are on track to hold both shareholder votes on August 26, and we’re very excited about that. And we expect to provide updates on the process when we have something to report. But we are on track, as you said, to close the deal in the first half of 2021, exactly as we communicated at the beginning. And I think really, since March 9 when we announced the deal, we’ve been spending a lot of time on the Willis Towers Watson integration, and we’re even more excited about the combination and the potential to meet unmet client needs. But maybe, Eric, you want to talk a little bit about that?
Eric Andersen: Sure, Christa. And I’m really excited about the early progress that we’ve had in the integration. Both Aon and Willis Towers Watson are excited about really what it means for our colleagues in particular. We’ve been focused on a colleague mission for quite some time about what each individual colleague can actually accomplish for themselves professionally, but also on behalf of the firm and their clients. And we’re really excited to see that WTW has been doing very similar mission. My integration partner in this,Julie Gebauer, and I both share a really growing excitement about what the possibilities are as we serve clients better, as we actually help our colleagues see themselves in the combined company. We’ve been working a lot on the culture part, recognizing and getting the people issues, right and, and building that vision and that opportunity for them to build their careers here will end up with a team. I think that will be the strongest in the industry and one that will draw and retain and attract talent that we need to solve the problems that Greg, you were talking about before.
Greg Case: One last thing I’d just add on that Elyse if I could it’s just the piece around we've asked multiple times around what about COVID-19 has that slowed you down. And I will tell you, in many respects, two things have happened on COVID-19; one with our colleagues that Eric can talk to you a little bit too, and Christa, and one of our clients. And the client one, our clients actually see the world changing around them. And it really does reinforce everything we’ve talked about in terms of, meeting unmet needs, not just in not just in kind of the pandemic, but what comes after the pandemic. So, in many respects who would have known, but COVID-19 for all of its challenges is completely reinforced everything we’ve tried to do or talk about doing, and that’s really showing up in the integrated integration planning that Eric was describing.
Elyse Greenspan: In terms of buyback, you guys said, limited buybacks for the second half of the year. Could you just kind of further define that? And then, what would you need to see it sounds like maybe a bounce back to pre-COVID economic conditions for you to more fully return to buying back your shares.
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question, Elyse. As you know, we value the firm on free cash flow and allocate capital based on return on capital, cash-on-cash return. And buyback remains the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon. We don’t give specific guidance on buybacks. But as I did mention, we are considering a limited share repurchase for the second half of the year subject to macroeconomic conditions, business performance and timing restrictions related to our combination with Willis Towers Watson. In 2020, we’ve managed the balance sheet conservatively and we do not expect to add further debt at this time given macroeconomic conditions. We remain committed to our current investment-grade ratings including in combination with Willis Towers Watson. We issued $1 billion of debt, and we’ve already used $600 million of that to prepay the $600 million of term debt that came due that is coming due in September 2020. And so you should expect us to continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively given the outlook and uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment. So you may see more elevated levels of cash and short-term investments through the end of the year. When you think about our available cash and uses of cash in 2020, we’ve spent or committed about $1.4 billion in cash on about $460 million of buyback, which we completed in Q1, $400 million of M&A largely completed in Q1, $400 million of dividends, and almost $500 million in restructuring, pension and CapEx, as we’ve shown in prior investor materials. And we’ve also communicated $200 million of expected deal costs, $36 million of which we’ve incurred year-to-date with the majority to be incurred when we include when we close the transaction with Willis Towers Watson. And we have $400 million of term debt coming due in March next year. So we’ll likely run elevated levels of cash and short-term balances in the near future given macroeconomic uncertainty. So while there’s a potential for limited share buyback through the remainder of the year, it will be dependent on macroeconomic conditions like what we see in the capital markets, business performance including working capital, and the timing restrictions around Willis Towers Watson.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you. And then one last numbers question. On the free cash flow, pretty strong increase this quarter. You highlighted strong operational improvement, temporary salary reductions, actions to improve working capital and lower restructuring cost. So obviously, the temporary salary reductions come back in the third quarter. So it’s a component of the four buckets. Is there any way you could tell us how big of a driver and tailwind that was to free cash flow, the Q2, as we think about it reversing into Q3?
Christa Davies: Yes. So thanks for the question, Elyse. Free cash flow for the first half of 2020 is exceptionally strong, up $875 million or 343%, just a very impressive performance and a result of the focus of all of our leaders across Aon as we drive revenue and translate each dollar of revenue into the max amount of free cash flow. I’ll say there were three big components, Elyse, to the free cash flow growth. The largest single component was improvements in operating income. And so we had a substantial growth in operating income. And then the second biggest driver was improvements in working capital, specifically improved receivables and improved payables. There was no meaningful change in free cash flow in Q2 from not repaying the reduction in temporary salary. So it really doesn't change the odds there.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thanks for the color.
Operator: Next, we have Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Dave Styblo: Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just want to come back to Elyse's question, then and ago and just clarify. I know, consensus has changed a lot for Aon standalone that was sort of the benchmark you guys used for EPS accretion. I guess when I run the math, I realize we're not going to probably get to that same peak in terms of an EPS dollar. But is it still fair to think that the 10% to 15% accretion by year three still holds?
Christa Davies: So the accretion analysis was provided in connection with the combination. It was based on $800 million of expected, annual pre-tax cost synergies which we still expect to achieve. However, the macroeconomic outlook has changed. And we withdrew the financial guidance of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and double-digit free cash flow growth. We have not reinstated any kind of guidance going forward. And so we can't actually update that guidance at this point. Recent macroeconomic events do not impact the $800 million of cost synergies, and we continue to be really excited about the combination's potential for clients and revenue opportunities as well.
Dave Styblo: Yes, I guess my point is, if you were to recast it and from the outside and we you know, we've recast in Aon as standalone, it’s still accretive to that new face so by 10% to 15% is how I was trying to frame it if I didn't make it clear that way.
Christa Davies: Yes, so look, we think the opportunity economically still remains exceptionally strong. And I would note that the accretion dilution we originally provided only included the cost synergies, because that was the only thing under the Irish Takeover Code we were able to report on externally. So it doesn’t include, as an example, Dave, any kind of improvements in working capital, any kind of improvement in CapEx, any kind of improvements in any other things that actually drove free cash flow. Equally, it doesn't include any kind of revenue upside. And so we do believe the opportunity of the combination remains exceptionally strong. And as Greg highlighted earlier on the call, we’re more excited today about the combination than we were when we announced it on March 9.
Dave Styblo: Yes. Okay. That's great. And then on your comments for second half, obviously, still an uncertain macro environment. I think you had commented that if conditions are very similar to where we're at right now, we might expect similar organic pressure. I guess, I’m curious why that pressure might not worsen as we go forward. Some of the feedback from other companies and channel checks suggest that sometimes there’s a bit of a delay on the revenue side especially on the broking side. So curious just to reconcile those comments with some other things that we’ve heard in the industry in terms of why things don't go down even further in the second half from an organic standpoint.
Greg Case: Well, I think, Dave, overall, I think you’re the macro point I want to start with, which is literally in terms of overall organic revenue expectations for Q3 and Q4, as you highlight, obviously uncertain, as I mentioned in my comments. Look, if the current macroeconomic conditions persist, what we essentially highlighted is we expect to see firm wide revenue pressures similar to what we observed in Q2. Remember things do ebb and flow. They do lag, but we’re reacting all the time. I mean Christa highlighted it before, when you think about what we have in Aon Business Services and what it means to enable us to do to connect with clients, how we’re innovating on frankly new client development, all these things sort of create opportunities for us that are going to also evolve as the current situation evolves. So our view is it is uncertain. But if you step back and think about it, based on that uncertainty, similar to Q2 is probably a good basis to start with.
Dave Styblo: Okay. Last one, real quick. I know last call you guys had talked about Retirement and Data & Analytics probably having more exposure to organic revenue pressure because of higher discretionary spend in those businesses. Retirement actually held up fairly well. I’m curious to hear why that might have outperformed some of the comments relative to what we would have thought. And is there a sort of delayed impact there that we might need to watch out for in the back half?
Greg Case: There really isn’t the retirement colleagues like many of our colleagues across the across the firm. Again, just want to highlight again, how much we appreciate all they do to lead on behalf of clients. It's been extraordinary, very strong, continued performance on the investment side. The retirement piece continues, it just is an incredibly strong franchise the team has built over time. And that continues to be a foundation. Obviously some pressure on human capital side that was more than offset by the progress on the former two. So that’s really, how we held position and we expect to continue to do so. We don’t see a lag in that over time. Again, no prediction things are unclear, but that's really what drove the performance in Q2.
Dave Styblo: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Next we have Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions, both related on expenses. I just wanted to clarify that you’re implying that assuming sort of a stable type environment with what you’re expecting, right now, discretionary spending will increase in the second half versus where it’s been. So that and then secondly, as you think about your expenses in the long run, is there anything that you’re doing differently now, that might have some sustainable benefits even beyond the COVID pandemic, whether it’s sort of less travel or a smaller real estate footprint or something else?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much for the question, Jimmy. We do as you said continuously macroeconomic uncertainty for the second half of the year. However, we do see a decrease likelihood of worst-case scenarios. And in the first half, we did take pre-emptive and temporary expense reductions, and the second half of 2020 we expect operating expenses to be more consistent with underlying expenses in the second half of 2019, excluding restructuring charges. Due to spending on some very targeted investments in priority areas, due to some of the deferred expenses, things and on projects, unnecessary operations, for example IT and cyber, but maintaining strong operational expense discipline. And then, I guess in answer your question on sort of T&E, I guess what we would say is, we expect small increases in T&E in the second half, but the margin expansion we saw in the first half of 2020 includes substantial reductions to T&E that isn’t sustainable in the long term. But maybe Eric, you just want to talk about sort of T&E and how this actually applies to clients.
Eric Andersen: Sure. Thanks, Christa. And I think if you step back and think about the reason for T&E, right, which is really to get closer to our clients and our partners to develop that personal relationship, with the investments that we've been making in technology, we’re using that video capability to actually get closer to clients and get closer to market partners. Just an example, just to try and bring it home, I participated in a pretty significant global placement for a new client literally last week. And we were talking about the insurance capital available. We had people on the screen from New York, London, Singapore and Bermuda. And instead of flying everybody in for the meeting, kind of burning four days and tens of thousands of dollars, we were actually able to create a session for the client where they could actually see our global experts talk about our capabilities, talk about what was available. And literally other than a couple of hours sleep for our guys in Asia, who had to work through the time zones, the client walked away actually seeing the entirety of the firm and what it could do for them on the topic as well as see the banter, see the relationships that were there, see our ability to interact with global markets pretty much anywhere to help them. And so while there will be some interaction with clients in person obviously down the road, we really want to make sure that we take the best of what we’ve been learning over the last four months and embedded into the firm because we actually think it drives a better outcome for the client, and it showcases our talent in a way that historically, they would not have been in the room. So it really is I think we’re really excited about what it can do for us when we interact with clients especially when you need the global team together.
Christa Davies: And so Jimmy, just to answer your question, we do see opportunities, as Eric described, in potentially reimagining the way we work with our colleagues. And whether that’s from T&E or whether that’s from real estate, it’s really around the goal of actually maximizing client impact, as Eric described, with a more flexible, inclusive and productive environment for colleagues. And, Greg, maybe you just want to talk a little bit about sort of the partnership that we formed to actually reimagine the future work because its pretty exciting.
Greg Case: Yes. It really is, Christa. It's terrific. Just on Eric’s piece, too, remember, if you think about the Aon United strategy, in order to actually operationalize that, clients got to see everybody connected together. And that actually meant before more travel because everybody had to come. Now they actually can show up. They can show up through the technology. It actually is a way to accelerate Aon United. So I think Eric’s point was really a terrific one. What Christa is highlighting is, look, we step back and asked the question how can we as Aon how can we help clients accelerate through and create economic recovery faster and faster coming out of this current environment. And we ask client’s is there a basis. Is there a benefit to comparing notes with each other around what we’re doing? And we raised our hand first in Chicago, and I will tell you their response was unbelievable. So we literally have the full [Indiscernible] of Chicago. These are companies, the most significant companies in Chicago, getting together, talking about work travel and convening. By the way, we started with back to work. We all realized that was a joke. Everybody is already working. So this is really not about work. By the way, it was really around how you connect with clients and do what you do. And in essence, we went from Chicago, now launched or beginning to launch in New York, London, Singapore. We have Madrid online as well. So we have cities around the world comparing notes, Jimmy, on how we accelerate economic recovery. And this, again, reinforces sort of what we're all about in terms of helping clients succeed in difficult environments and leveraging Aon United capability in order to do that.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have Sean Reitenbach from KBW. Your line is now open.
Sean Reitenbach: Hi, I was hoping you could talk about maybe the trajectory in consultative end project related work and how that -- if that started to kind of return late in 2Q into July, and do expect, like as we the economy normalizes, is it going to be a more steady return of that business? Or do you expect it to be a little lumpier?
Greg Case: Sean, we actually see it, it’s really varies. And I'll offer some thoughts then get Eric to jump in to add some color or commentary as well as you go across solution lines. This is really back to kind of we call it the discretionary parts of our business in general. And obviously, they dropped off substantially in Q2. But we see them coming back as clients have had a chance to take a breath, understand where they are, begin to get some stability. They're happening in a different way, again, advantage for us because we can connect with them, with Aon Business Services and actually offer new thoughts and views and perspectives on how to improve what they're doing, but it really does vary. So we're seeing it in elements of commercial risk. The example I gave in my opening comments really was about colleagues coming together across solution lines to create an innovative solution that didn’t exist. And in some respects, that was discretionary work for a bit. Then it became a real solution and ended up in being a series of products. So a whole series of things are happening across the firm in different ways. And I think it’s going to be in fits and starts. You’re going to see real opportunities pop up. There is no kind of steady state return. It’s going to be us doing what we do, finding opportunities in supporting clients. But Eric, thoughts as you’re seeing this across solution lines?
Eric Andersen: Yes. Look, I think clients all over the world, they are trying to reposition themselves into these new economic scenario. So whether it’s our retirement clients who are looking at the volatility in the marketplace using our investment consulting capability, whether it’s the risk management clients who are trying to figure out how to navigate new risks, how to navigate the existing environment that they are trading in, even on the reinsurance side, where the carriers are also looking at how do they reposition themselves to take advantage of growth and opportunities ultimately, I think that type of work is going to continue. It is as Greg said, it’s coming in fits and starts as they sort of engage outside providers as they after they’ve done their internal strategy sessions. But I think it’s the need is certainly there, and we’ll engage the clients as they get ready. And coming out of the coalition work, the entire effort around talent management and how that’s evolved over time and what’s different about it in the current environment with everyone working from home, sleeping at work as it were, all these things have created a level of project work that wasn’t there before. We don’t want to imply this offsets everything, but it’s evolving as client need shifts and evolves.
Sean Reitenbach: That's very helpful. Helpful. Obviously, Reinsurance Solutions had a strong organic quarter. And I was just hoping if we could get some commentary in terms of the reinsurance markets. What’s going on with some supply and demand dynamics? And based on kind of what we know now coming out of midyear renewals, thoughts on persistency for those trends to carry into 1/1. Obviously, there’s still a hurricane season to come but based on what we know now kind of.
Greg Case: Yes. There is certainly a hurricane season to come. Listen, I’m really excited about the work that our reinsurance team has been doing in the first half of the year, certainly working closely with the insurance company clients as they reposition themselves. And I would say listen, the market, very similar to what you see on a commercial risk side, the insurers will pick their spots with which to trade risk or find other ways to deal with it, either through what they underwrite on the front end or raise capital or sidecars. So there's a multiple way with which the insurers will manage their risk. So I wouldn’t get too caught up in the pricing conversations that are happening in the marketplace because like commercial risk clients, they will either trade or hold or mitigate as best they can. So I would say that we continue to be optimistic about sort of the reinsurance business in general, the work they’re doing. Most of the treaty revenue is done already. As you said, nobody really sells property catastrophe in the middle of hurricane season. So it will be more of a fact business and an ILS business going into the second half, and it's 25% of the revenue left to do for the year. So but I would say the insurance company clients are working hard at figuring out how they want to position themselves in this new market, and we're there to help them.
Sean Reitenback: Thank you very much.
Operator: Next, we have Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Phil Stefano: Yes, thanks. I wanted to ask a quick question about the $16 million adjustment in Health Solutions. We’ve seen some peers talking about 606 revenue adjustments because of things like exposure, were down or something along those lines. In my mind, this reads like a little bit of a different story. But I guess I was just hoping you can provide some color into what exactly is underlying this adjustment?
Greg Case: Yes, and so maybe just indulge for a second. I want to give you some, some background on sort of our health results for the quarter. And Christa will talk very specifically about your question, by the way, it is apples and oranges. It doesn’t apply, what she’ll describe. Look in terms of organic revenue for us in Q2, and health, it was really describe it as kind of a perfect storm. But the good news results have actually no bearing on our long term outlook, on what we believe is an incredible amount of opportunity in the solution line. The context for us just you know, for reference to is relatively small quarter for us. So changes are magnified. We obviously break out the health business, a lot of others embed it in their other solution lines we don’t. We highlighted that, we completed implementation of a new system, which resulted in a onetime adjustment, was approximate 5% decline. And the performance pressure was really around discretionary areas and core on, reduction in employment as I described. But I will say, the work we did on for clients has been exceptional. And Health Solutions for us is, you know, can you just be just an exceptionally strong positive area on opportunity area. And COVID-19 ironically, again did nothing but underscore the long term importance of this priority area. Although you might have noticed, our last two acquisition announcement Farmington welcomed them into Aon on April 7, earlier this year, absolutely a tremendous capability that we're going to be able to scale across our firm. And last thing I wanted to say on this is, it’s just opportunities everywhere in the world. And, while this isn't the result we wanted, we're disappointed in the result. I do want to call up my colleagues in health here, they've done a remarkable, remarkable job supporting clients that have been under tremendous stress that's reflected, sort of you see in the economy every day and they have just done an incredible job in that. And I think that bodes very well for our business going forward. But your specific question on Christa.
Christa Davies: Yes, so Phil, just on the 16 million adjustments. It is identified with a new system implementation. It will not repeat in future periods. What this specifically is? We adopted and when we adopted the new revenue recognition standard on the first of January 2018, we had a temporary system in place for health. And we’ve now adopted our long term technological solution, much more granular, much more robust. It's not uncommon to have adjustments like this when you switch systems. And as Greg outlined, we feel really good about the growth of our business long term and health, an exceptional opportunity to deliver value for clients.
Phil Stefano: No, sorry wasn't trying to be critical in any way. Just wanted to get a flavor for these oranges because it felt -- it felt like it was different. Just a quick procedural question for you. To the extent that there was a change in the outlook for the merger benefits or the need to divest of something, and then happened after the shareholder vote. What would this look like? And how would the next month or two unfold as we move towards merger completion? I understand everything is on pace. And that's not going to be the case, but just in some crazy other scenario kind of world. What would this look like procedurally?
Greg Case: So from our standpoint, it's really not something we could speculate on, because we don't see that in any way, shape or form fill. Our view is, as Eric described, this has built momentum from the get go with our colleagues as they have come together and talked about the possibilities on integration planning, with our clients who, as I described before, see this as the potential for something new, for something they need to a lot of potential there. We talked about the shareholder vote on the 26, a lot of momentum into that. And then we're working through all the normal antitrust processes as Christa described, fully on track to close in Q1. So that's kind of how we see it. That's what's going forward. And, again, all the original expectations sort of in -- in the expense opportunities. Sure, they are absolutely there. This is never about expense, it was about growth. The combined firm and we described mid-single digit or greater, that's still in place. We pulled that for now, for all the reasons that are obvious. But as you think about long term, everything we see points to momentum. And that's what, that's what we're talking about.
Phil Stefano: Great. I'm looking forward to seeing it, and best of luck.
Greg Case: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions on queue. I would now like to turn the call over back to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: Just want to say thanks to everybody for joining the call. We appreciate it. And one last shout out to colleagues if Aon around the world. Thanks for all you've done on behalf of the firm, each other and our clients. It's been -- it's been exceptional. Thanks and talk next quarter.
Operator: That concludes the conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc’s First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2020 results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Thanks Elena and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I am joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO, and Eric Andersen, our President. Like previous quarters we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. At this time of unprecedented humanitarian and economic challenge I want to start by thanking our 50,000 Aon colleagues around the world for their remarkable dedication, resilience and impressive response to this crisis. It is inspiring to see our colleagues tirelessly going to extraordinary lengths to support each other and connect the firm embracing and united. Our global team is fully committed to bring in the best of our firm to clients at a time when they need our help more than ever. As we all know, we're experiencing the humanitarian tragedy at a scale that's difficult to comprehend and economic consequences are likely to play out for months or even years to come. The global economy is forecast to shrink by 3% in 2020 and unemployment is increasing around the world. Against that backdrop I'd like to talk about how we're responding as a firm and how we expect to emerge stronger and even more capable. Our colleagues are the firm and we're committed to their safety and well-being and response to local government guidelines we've canceled travel and events and now have over 98% of our colleagues working remotely. And to ensure our colleagues stay healthy, well and productive we made available to all colleagues virtual learning tools to optimize remote work as well as multiple tools and services around telemedicine and well-being. We've also increased communication and connectivity across the firm and our leadership teams and our COVID-19 taskforce, accelerate best practice sharing, coordinate our responses and anticipate future impacts to ensure we can continue to deliver solutions for clients. Further, Aon business services operational platform ensures that we can work remotely with secure access to all applications with no loss of productivity enabling our team full access to all resources required to be client be. And finally we're committed that no colleague will lose their job as a result of COVID-19. Turning to Q1 results. Our team delivered a strong quarter with positive performance across each of our key metrics despite some early disruptions from the impacts of COVID-19 at the end of the quarter. Our results include 5% organic revenue growth with particular strength from reinsurance solutions and health solutions. Substantial operating margin expansion of 200 basis points to 35.7% [audio gap] To coordinate our pandemic response for clients our COVID-19 taskforce brings together experts from across the firm to develop, deliver and share solutions from around the world both for our own firm and for clients. In one example as the pandemic quickly escalated in Italy our commercial risk and all solutions colleagues partnered with carriers to address a need for COVID-19 coverage for our clients’ employees. This unique and tailor-made solution provides employees with allowances for hospitalization and recovery expenses in the event they are diagnosed with COVID-19. In addition, the cover provides post hospitalization assistance including domestic assistance, childcare and more. The solution is now available in Italy and Spain and we're working to scale this further across the globe; a great example of our and United team innovating on behalf of clients during a very critical time. In another instance, in New York our human capital team developed an analytic tool to assess the pandemic risk to a community's workforce in a real speed recovery. The tool they built uses Department of Labor data and Aon analytics to analyze occupational risk by job and location based on more characteristics like proximity and exposure. The team took that model and layered on medical forecasts from health solutions team to map potential impacts by geography over time. The resulting tool helps communities plan reopening strategies while minimizing risk and prioritizing antibody tests for the highest risk and most mission-critical workers. Currently we're using our model in partnership with community groups in New York, but we anticipate rolling it out to clients communities around the world. And these are just two examples of the many ways in which we're helping clients respond in the new demands of these challenging times. Christa will elaborate more on our financial results and outlook, however, I would highlight that our business is global diversified and highly resilient given its largely recurring and non-discretionary business and we operate in over 120 countries and virtually every sector and business segment. It's also important to reinforce that given our strong historic focus on cash flow, we are fortunate to have an exceptionally strong understanding of revenue, cost and cash. Within our single P&L we have the ability to assess cash and other performance by business, by geography, by solution line and by individual offering. This capability has been in place and been further refined every year for well over a decade. With this embedded capability for our business we can compare the current economic environment to the recession of 2008-2009. We have considered a number of macroeconomic scenarios and their potential impacts to our business. At this unique point in time no one can predict the future. However, we will continue to act from a position of strength on areas that we can control and to protect our colleagues and our clients. Well, we always hope for the best, we've taken steps to prepare for virtually any economic scenario. For Q1, we did see some early impacts of COVID-19 especially in more discretionary areas within retirement and data analytics. Overall, the impact we've seen on revenue and cash ledger April is modest. Moving forward, we're taking steps in three areas; our top priority is to proactively support colleagues followed by our priorities to manage expenses and conserve liquidity. First we're reducing non-compensation expenses through an effort which began in early March. Second, we paused share buyback and M&A, although we're committed to maintaining our dividend. And third, we have committed that no colleague will lose their job as a result of COVID-19. In order to protect all 50,000 colleagues, we're asking them to support the firm with a temporary compensation reduction and we're planning for roughly 70% of colleagues to take a reduction of up to 20% of salary which will be implemented in accordance with local practices. While the remaining roughly 30% of our firm will see no reduction. This step is intended to protect 50,000 colleagues and insurers that we are able to continue to deliver with full capability of Aon at a time when clients need us most. Taking these pre-emptive steps now from a position of strength ensures we're able to continue to invest in increasing our relevance to clients as we continue to look to address their unmet needs. One outcome of the current trauma is that we're seeing it’s a heightened interest by clients and understanding where other areas of major potential risk might exist. Specifically we've seen concerning areas like cyber, climate change and the health wealth gap, which may create future debilitating events. Up to now these risks have only been addressed in a very limited way, for example, for one client COVID-19 highlighted that when catastrophes happen whether epidemics or natural catastrophes a very key aspect of successful recovery is access to liquidity and capital to match exposures available immediately. To create the cover and fulfill the required speedy resolution our team designed an innovative parametric insurance solution to address earthquake exposure. The program quickly provides our client with a liquidity infusion in the event of a quake and gives them broad discretion on how to use these funds. This product covers our client and the exposure to their employees who may require financial assistance ensuring the resilience and responsiveness in a future crisis. Driving faster innovation for clients is a key outcome of our strategy and one that we can accelerate through our plan combination with Willis Towers Watson. As our world becomes more complex clients need the unique capabilities that this combination will create. Our two firms have been on similar paths focused on bringing the best solutions from across their respective organizations to clients. As a combined firm we will be able to accelerate progress and become even more relevant to our clients with faster innovation and better solutions. In summary, our global team has been truly remarkable in the response to the COVID-19 crisis supporting each other and our clients. In addition, they delivered a strong first quarter of progress even at the early effects of the crisis were being experienced. We believe our Aon United growth strategy is positioned us very well to emerge from the current crisis and even stronger firm position for long-term growth. With that overview I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and outlook. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much Greg and good morning everyone. As I talk about our results, I'll also provide some thoughts on how the macroeconomic environment impacts our outlook and the steps we're taking to proactively and conservatively manage our business and our balance sheet to ensure we retain stability and flexibility and position our firm to continue to deliver shareholder value over the long term. Our business has strong fundamentals. Our revenue base is diversified across industry, geography and solution line. Roughly 80% is non-discretionary and has a significant portion that renews every year with 95% retention rates on average. However, given uncertainty around duration and magnitude of COVID-19 and the resulting economic downturn and its impact to our clients and our firm, the near-term we're withdrawing our financial guidance of mid single digital aggression organic revenue growth and double-digit free cash flow growth. We are also taking prudent steps to preemptively reduce expenses and discretionary uses of cash in order to maintain the strength of our balance sheet and optimized financial flexibility in the event of any future declines in revenue. We are taking these actions from division of strength and know they will position us to continue to protect our colleagues, execute our Aon United strategy and focus on our key financial metrics in the short and long term. In Q1, we delivered strong operational and financial performance to start the year. We achieved 5% organic revenue growth that translated into solid operational improvement for becoming an unfavorable near-term impact from foreign currency translation. As I reflect on each of our key financial metrics, first we delivered organic revenue growth of 5%. We strengthen reinsurance solutions and health solutions offset by some early disruption from the impacts of COVID-19 and our retirement and data analytics businesses. I would also note the reported revenue was pressured by FX and the ongoing impact of divestitures from efforts we've described in prior quarters to reshape our portfolio to high growth and higher margin areas. Second, we delivered solid operational improvement with operating income growth of 8%, operating margin expansion of 200 basis points and 11% earnings per share growth driven by a strong organic revenue growth and ongoing productivity improvement and expense discipline from Aon Business Services. As we noted in our earnings material FX with an unfavorable impact for approximately $0.03 in the quarter. At today's rates we would expect $0.03 per share unfavorable impact in Q2, $0.04 per share unfavorable impact in Q3 and $0.06 per share unfavorable impact in Q4. Third, free cash flow was $279 million in the quarter and I would note Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter for cash flow due primarily to incentive compensation payments. The $279 million this year is an increase from last year's $17 million which was negatively impacted by approximately $85 million of net cash payments related to legacy litigation. The increase in free cash flow was driven by operating income growth as well as near-term actions we've taken to delay certain expenses. We did see an increase in receivables primarily driven by the strong 9% organic revenue growth in reinsurance solutions. As I looked towards the rest of the year, we have confidence in the underlying resilience of our business and while much of our business is non-discretionary it is impacted by long term macroeconomic factors like GDP growth, employment and property values amongst other things. While we are not providing revenue guidance I wanted to provide a bit more insight into our business that may be helpful in understanding how we may be impacted in various economic scenarios. We have a very stable revenue base with 80% of our revenues in core highly recurring businesses with retention rates of 95% on average.
or: In an economic downturn, we expect to see a larger and more immediate impact in the more discretionary portion of our book. We've already started to see some early impacts of COVID-19 in Q1 as I mentioned and given the overall global economic environment we expect this could be more negatively impacted going forward. Within our solution lines commercial risk, reinsurance and health include the largest core component, while retirement solutions and data analytic services have the largest components that are more discretionary. More positively as Greg mentioned we see significant opportunities in areas of our business around innovative solutions to address the current crisis, for instance in balance sheet and liquidity solutions for clients. Overall, we're confident in our strong fundamental business. We did not see material impacts to revenue or collections in Q1 or in April. However, given global economic uncertainty, we're taking steps to manage costs prudently and defer some spend investment in order to proactively get in front of any negative impacts. Our business is highly resilient and a historic investment in Aon Business Services gives us the ability to make quicker, smarter decisions across the firm to manage expenses. The steps we've taken with our Aon Business Services platform to drive operational efficiency not only help us manage costs and improve margins but also help us continue to manage cash flow and working capital which further ensures our stability and flexibility. For instance, in Q1 82% of our outside services spend was managed centrally allowing us to manage purchase decisions, ensure we derived maximum supplier value and optimize working capital. This allows us to take steps now to defer preemptively and reduce costs. I would note that these expense reductions will contribute to near-term margin improvement, however, some like travel and entertainment do not reflect sustainable core operating margin expansion. Overall, our Aon Business Services operating platform enables us to operate effectively while we continue to run the firm on cash and prudently manage our cash and liquidity positions. In the past [indiscernible] focused and delivered on key financial metrics of organic revenue growth, operating margins, free cash flow and return on invested capital. In today's economic environment, the context is different but our strategy and tactic to drive performance of our firm remain the same. Our historic focus on maximizing the translation of revenue into the highest level of free cash flow serves us well in this environment as we focus on conserving capital to enable future growth. These steps and others we've taken to drive operating income growth make progress on working capital and reduce structural uses of cash are perhaps more essential now in this economic environment than ever before. For instance, we have daily cash flow forecasting across the lines of the cash flow statement. Because we've run the firm based on free cash flows for well over 10 years now this gives us the ability to compare our free cash flow to previous years and in particular to the financial crisis of 2008-2009. This gives us the ability to analyze and take steps to address any challenges by country, by business, by line of the cash flow statement and to look out for early markers or trends for instance from areas that may have been more hard-hit by COVID-19. I'd also highlight that structural uses of cash in pension, restructuring and CapEx collectively are expected to free up approximately $300 million of cash in 2020 compared to 2019. While we are maintaining our dividend, we have paused our discretionary use of cash, the share buyback and M&A. We're very confident in the strength of our balance sheet and how we manage liquidity. We do not take on the riding risk and we're committed to our investment grade credit ratings. We manage liquidity risks through a well lettered debt maturity profile with no more than $750 million of term debt coming due in any given year. We have $1.65 billion in committed credit from our $900 million credit facility due in 2022 and a $750 million credit facility due in 2023. We have not had a need to draw on our committed credit despite our seasonally lowest period of cash flow. We also continue to access commercial paper markets from working capital needs in the U.S. and Europe. We know this prudence makes us resilient now and prepares us to come out stronger. As Greg mentioned, we are committed and excited about our combination with Willis Todd Watson and we expect to file a joint preliminary proxy in the coming weeks followed by a joint definitive proxy and shell of vote which we expect in Q3. In summary, our colleagues, business and United strategy and our Aon Business Services operational platform are strong and equip us well to react challenging time. The steps we've taken to drive our key financial priorities are more relevant than ever as we manage flexibility and stability in these challenging times. Our disciplined approach to free cash flow and return on invested capital provides stability and flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term. With that I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I recognized like and I think we all do the fluidity of the situation and the impact of COVID-19 and obviously you guys wanting to remove your organic guidance for the time being but is there any way that you can give us a sense on – to the best of your abilities right now what the organic view is for the balance of the year? Maybe some kind of wide range from one extent to the other, just so we have a sense of -- is it's still going to be slightly positive flat, slightly negative kind of maybe some kind of range of health, range of outcomes of how COVID might impact the business?
Christa Davies: Yes. So Elyse, we're not giving guidance on revenue and margins as you described because of the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment but we are managing them very closely over the course of the year and we would expect that if there are any reductions in revenue that we would reduce expenses proportionally to match and very much focused on managing free cash flow to the firm to preserve flexibility and stability over the long term. I would note if you think about the macro-environment Elyse in 2008/2009 when GDP was essentially flat our worst year of organic revenue growth was minus 1%. So we do have a very stable business in global economic recession.
Greg Case: And Elyse I might add. If you think about sort of just put in the perspective it's very important question. It’s to the Christa's reference -- the history and the facts are very helpful to set the baseline. So 2008-2009 just discussed to describe what's different from 2008-2009 and today but we'd say two things are different. One, obviously Aon is much stronger and United strategies 10 years more mature and United blueprint, the plan we have and how we deliver the global firms for clients in place and business services is a real game-changer for us. We didn't have in 2008-2009, driving business improvement, executing at scales. So all these things are in place. We've also had a very substantial spend on data as you're well aware since then $400 million a year so call it $3.5 billion to $4 billion and we're seeing opportunities around that new and new business generation and retention at all-time highs. So that's different. We're stronger firm. What's also different though objectively comparing it to then the current economic trauma is likely much worse but we don't know, right now no one knows. Q2 is obviously a problem. In the U.S. greater than 30% reduction in GDP. $26 million unemployment claims for last five months, that suggest unemployment's greater than 20%, EMEA has obviously got a tremendous amount 50 million employees worst potentially affected Asia same place. Until the duration it is not known. In normal course really is a sort of how fast the recovery going to happen and by geography also going to play out and as Christa described in her script in particular as we want to be in a position to perform in every scenario and that’s what we believe we're set up to do.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then on the margin side, Christa you said right -- you guys are focused on managing expenses. So it's a message that maybe there's some fluidity on what happens with organic but regardless of the range of outcomes you guys would continue to do the expense management, will continue to expect to show margin improvement?
Christa Davies: So Elyse we haven't given guidance on margins nor giving direct on revenue but we do manage margins over the course of the year and we would expect that we will reduce expenses proportionally with revenue impacts for the full year and I will tell you Elyse what we've done is, we've acted early from a position of strength and we are taking actions on what we can control and we're not predicting the future. We are hoping for the best but we are planning for every economic outcome and so we have taken actions as Greg and I talked about in our opening remarks to reduce expenses ahead of any economic impact we see to ensure we come out stronger and we want to make sure that we are able to deliver for clients in a time of greater need for them.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. One last one. You guys announced the merger with the acquisition of Willis at the start of March kind of before the economic slowdown picked up and when you announced the deal you had put forth the target of mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth for the combined firms and now that deal isn't closed, so first half of next year so would be long-term view of getting back to that mid-single digit or greater organic growth kind of when we come out of this slowdown, is that still the combined view going into that acquisition?
Christa Davies: It certainly is Elyse. We would say, we announced our acquisition, though we announced that combination with Willis Towers Watson on March 9th and we are even more excited about it today than we were then. As we continue to engage with Willis Towers Watson we find that the DNA and strategies of the firm are remarkably similar and we are incredibly excited about the opportunity for clients and the up side to meet unmet client needs and we do believe that the combination has complementary capabilities to be able to deliver to clients and so we certainly see that the upside and revenue over time is very much in line with the commitment to mid-single digit or greater over the long term.
Greg Case: I think Elyse as you think about the potential and John Haley I talked about that really from day one, the entire thesis behind the combination of Aon and Willies Towers Watson centers on bringing the two firms together do really set a new standard in client leadership and impact in the combination as we described is better now with complementary capability as Christa mentioned within solution lines and geographies and segments tremendous opportunity. But not just better now we think better in the future back to your point on mid-single digit or greater, better in the future with analytics capability, better understanding of working client need, our ability to create new market solutions, etc. all these things come together and really doing something for clients which up to now, no one's been able to really do and address sort of major risk challenges like pandemic, climate change, cyber, health, wealth. Ironically this current trauma has just reinforced in so many ways, the value of the combination and I would agree we would say March 9th we had high expectations having spent more time with John Haley and the team, our high expectations are exceeded and we're really looking forward to the next steps.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. One quick question on the recurring revenue stream. I think Christa when you talked about 80% of that being recurring is that in a normal scenario? We don't have a lot of small businesses going out of business or is that sort of framing the current expectations?
Christa Davies: That's framing the current expectations Meyer. We would say is 80% of our business is core and core tends to be highly recurring, non-discretionary things like property and casualty, DNO, cyber treaty, actual work on pension plans, etc. but 20% of our business is more discretionary and more discretionary much of this recurs and renews each year and so we do have a very stable and resilient business. Less than 1% of our revenue comes from any single client and we operate in 100 countries, different industries, different segments of the economy. So we feel very good about the resilience of our business.
Meyer Shields: Okay. No, that's helpful. Greg, can you talk on a big-picture perspectives about the compensation reduction and what that could imply for employee retention?
Greg Case: Well, I would say Meyer from our standpoint, first take a step back that now we're really focusing on creating value for our clients and taking care of colleagues and really to emerge as a stronger firm. I will tell you, we reflect we're humbly proud of the principles based approach we've taken and the commitments we made and it really come true as we described before. A lot has happened in the world and while everyone's hoping for a bounce-back, the ultra result will be by the way the bounce back to a major recession, I guess is what everyone is anticipating but no one really knows what it's going to look like and how long it's going to look and we step back and listen we've got to be in a position in any scenario to perform on behalf of clients -- on behalf of colleagues. And for us, first I would just ask you to consider the foundation upon which we made close and important metric for a better part of a decade. That coupled with Aon Business Services, really is a very unique perspective on where we stand at any time and this is really all aspects of performance cash all aspects and ability to execute decisions across the board. And by all measures, I mean look at the quarter, look at the results, we currently stand in an exceptionally strong position. We know that and we know that very well. We also know what all the scenarios look like, all the economic scenarios irrespective of how remote and for us it's an absolute priority to have our entire firm in place to support clients and a potentially historic and sustained downturn and if you take this priority seriously it requires you to take difficult steps now as Christa highlighted to protect 50,000 colleagues. And so, the alternative by the way is to hope and hope that the current downturn really comes back to 2008-2009 revisited that alternative by the way puts client leadership fully at risk at the very time clients might need it the most and there's no doubt in every respect that's the easier path to take you can sort of shade over a lot of things along the way and we have essentially said, listen we desperately hope that's the outcome but if it's not we want to be in an absolute unique and pristine place to help our client succeed and protect our colleagues. And what I would highlight is we're going to, we fully anticipate coming out a much stronger firm and this really comes back to our investment over the last decade in Aon United. I'll tell you something for our team, we often talk about Aon United and the capability in positive times but it turns out Aon United it is equally meaningful in times of challenge and this decade of investment in Aon United means we can take a global set of actions that we know will be difficult maybe for others to do but for us a global set of actions that really puts us in a position to support clients in every scenario. So our colleagues around the world have done very-very unique things and very-very strong things and we're excited right now about our ability to help clients in times of need, irrespective of what that comes out. So from our standpoint we're going to be a stronger firm coming out of it and we're taking steps, so that we can take, that we know it’s important or the right answer for us to make that happen.
Eric Andersen: Hey Greg, just to jump in a little bit on one of the examples, we talked about the COVID-19 taskforce in your early opening but I think it's important to recognize, this is the fourth time we've activated that group, going back to 2009 whether it was H1N1, SARS, Ebola. So this group is a group that consists of experts across the firm from everything from epidemiology to credit risk to capital solutions and liquidity; all different capabilities around the world and essentially what they're trying to do is innovate on behalf of clients, whether it's trying, whether they're working on, how they're dealing with their employees, how they are thinking about return to work, how they're working on capital solutions and liquidity for the firm it really is across the entire firm learning from areas of the world that were affected early being able to share best practices and so there is an advisory part of it for sure but more importantly, I think we're trying to help them think through on an innovative new way that you actually can't do until you pull all the capabilities together with one guiding principle of trying to help the clients get through this and so while the salary piece is one part there was a lot of innovation that we're pushing and working on to be able to help those clients get through the challenge.
Meyer Shields: Yes. Completely understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We have a question from Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is now open.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the base salary reductions. Can you just give some feedback in terms of how the employee response has been? It seems like obviously a pretty dramatic steps. So just curious what you've been hearing since Monday's announcement?
Eric Andersen: Yes. It really has been [indiscernible] for us. Again I would sort of come back incredibly strong positive reinforcement on Aon United and what we're all about. Again imagine when we essentially step back and ask our colleagues around the globe and our leadership team, how do we actually prepare on behalf of clients and we looked at all the scenarios and again as I highlighted the alternative right now for us is to hope that the current downturn ends up being a recession which by the way we hope too. We hopefully celebrate that not that's the case but we all realized at the time, the difficult choice is how do you protect 50,000 colleagues to serve clients in the most effective way and you recognize that if you wait and the downturn becomes more acute how do you actually have them there, how do you support the colleagues to do that and we collectively made a decision that we are going to take the steps we took because we know again in addition to protecting 50,000 jobs, our ability to continue supporting clients is extraordinary and so that was the piece. It was obviously, when we talked about it on Monday I would say since Monday what's happened around the world has really been our colleagues have embraced it and understood exactly what we're trying to do and as I said before we're coming through this a stronger firm and if we're wrong Sunnet, if we're wrong by the way, I hope we're wrong we hope it ends up being a recession in the end our colleagues know we took steps that perhaps, it would be hard for other people to take to support clients and that if we're wrong we basically remediate all the actions we take and mitigate our actions, no problem whatsoever and they've done something no one else could do. And the fact that we could act across the firm in Aon United fashion is pretty unique and it actually has been incredibly invigorating as our colleagues have actually put this in place. Among other things as we have reduced expenses and done a number of other things Christa described that package puts our firm in a unique position to perform in ways really no one else could do under any scenario.
Suneet Kamath: Got it and is there any way that you can help us think through the size of the expense reductions that just may be as a percentage of total expenses just to help us frame how impactful what you guys are doing will be?
Christa Davies: Suneet, we haven't given guidance to the size of this. We would say that so far the expense reductions we've taken a modest and we're not giving guidance on revenue or margins but we would say that as if revenue were to come down that we would reduce expenses proportionally and we're also very focused as I mentioned earlier on cash and making sure that we maintain a very strong cash position. It's always been the way we run the firm. We have unique insight and visibility into our cash flow byline of the cash flow statement, by solution line and one of the things I would say is we've taken a number of actions on the non-salary side and we did that first. We reduced a number of expenses things like T&E, things like third party spend much earlier in Q1 and so we are taking action for a position of strength in advance of impacts we observe.
Greg Case: One other thing just to highlight Suneet in context of this is as we talk to client similar to the long discussion with the clients and month leading up to our decision on sort of what we've done across the board on the different aspects and when we explain the principles based approach our clients, not surprising are incredibly grateful. They understand what happened. They understand our inability to serve them if you take different courses when things get difficult and candidly some of our global clients have asked for the playbook. They don’t [indiscernible] said how do you do this around the world in different geographies and make it work and we've described to them what Aon United is all about, how it's played out over a decade, how we built out foundation over time and then seeing us come together support each other in an ability to support them in time to need whatever those times are has been also frankly inspiring for our colleagues to sort of get the reaction as clients recognize what we're doing on their behalf.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi good morning. So I had a few questions. First just on the impact of COVID, you discussed the sensitivity or the exposure of the various businesses but on the commercial risk business, your organic growth was decent 4% but it had been like 6% to 7% in the past couple of years actually and so is the decline just tougher comps or is it more just slow down in March and is it reasonable to assume that that's a business that could potentially turn negative in the near term?
Greg Case: Yes. Looking to my standpoint now we feel very strong momentum in commercial risk across the board as we highlight again in the first quarter. We were touching on some of the impacts come in at the end of the quarter in terms of sort of overall where we are but net we feel tremendous momentum sort of across each of our solution lines particularly as we're connecting with clients. And there are a number of things that are happening sort of in those solution lines as they currently exist as well as our ability to candidly generate net new business I described before. Net new business for us all-time high, retention all-time high, roll over all-time high and there's just in the business it's also the net new things we're doing. Maybe Eric, can you talk a little bit about some of the bright spots that we're seeing across the playing field here as well as some of the new initiatives that we are put in place.
Eric Andersen: Sure Greg. There's a couple in particular certainly in the DNO area the work we're doing around distressed companies in particular has really created some opportunity for us and also trying to create liquidity using surety bonds, to place letters of credit in other areas along the lines I would say balance sheet protection and providing financial liquidity are just things that honestly today the clients are very interested in dealing with but also I would say just our traditional business and how we're providing advice and how helping clients do structuring and understanding the different areas where perhaps they can take more risk themselves or perhaps combined programs things along those lines. But we're pretty optimistic with the business as it came through the first quarter.
Greg Case: You look at the 80% that Christa described incredibly strong core, the 20% we are working through but these net new areas are very strong, very powerful in terms of how that plays out over time to build a momentum of the business.
Jimmy Bhullar: But you would expect the slowdown in that business as well in the short term though, right? In commercial? 
Christa Davies: We would expect is as I talked about the components of a business, we would expect our commercial risk, our reinsurance and our health businesses to have a much higher percentage of call than the rest of our business because the businesses are highly recurring non-discretionary and as Eric said they're regulated and required and offered a necessary cost of doing business even firms in financial distress.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just on the Willis deal, I think there was sort of -- on the part of Willis investors they were somewhat disappointed with the modest premium and obviously that you offered on the takeout and on top of that your stocks declined a lot but many Aon shareholders are also concerned about you potentially raising the offer especially given sort of the super voting requirements at Willis. Can you sort of discuss if the deal does not go through as proposed, would you be willing to walk away from it or is there a possibility you actually consider a higher bid?
Greg Case: And Jimmy, to be from my standpoint, listen we've been engaging with our shareholders and John Haley and team with their shoulders on the [indiscernible] what’s inside our feedback has been exceptionally positive. Again when our shareholders really started to understand and Willis starts to understand what this combination can do it's extraordinary and there is just no other way to describe it and it's extraordinary on behalf of clients. It's extraordinary in the now as I described for a bit the solution line complimentary pieces very-very positive, geographically very-very positive, in terms of what we're trying to do the segments are very positive. Obviously the future equally strong or stronger with analytic capability that lets us do things around understanding client need and creating that new markets that are extraordinary. So I think our investors see that potential are incredibly excited about it and Willis Towers Watson see the same incredibly excited about it, obviously the structure of the deal means the share price movements down are really less relevant in terms of where we are at all and so that's opportunity is extraordinary. Then obviously not to mention, we highlighted in 100 million in synergies and that isn't changing in any way shape or form. So from our standpoint, this is really about the upside in the revenue potential and new solutions for client and we're incredibly excited about it, continue to be and as I said before ironically if there's one thing about this current crisis, it's pandemic, it really highlights the need for higher octane, higher capability, higher insight and you want that, you go to Aon Willis Towers Watson that's really what we're talking about. So that's really been one of the observations our shareholders have made and so it's a Willis Towers Watson as we engage with them.
Christa Davies: And Greg, I would just add, I think as we look forward Jimmy we're very excited about the combination. You could hear the excitement in terms of even more excited today than we were we announced it on March 9th and going forward we expect sort of two big milestones; the first is we're going to follow up for preliminary proxy in the coming weeks and the second is in Q3 we will file a defender proxy and have both shareholder votes. So we're very much looking forward to those milestones and looking for the combined capabilities to be able to serve client needs better than we do today.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Dave Styblo: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Appreciate the global diversification and solutions that you guys can provide clients during this time and I said that can help insulate the business, at the same time -- at the same time everyone's trying to figure out and assess the impact of what larger companies might dial back down from the discretionary standpoint and smaller companies that may not able be able to survive. I'd like to pick a little bit more up to 80% of the business that's non-discretionary. I'm curious just to make sure, I understood comments there is that already contemplating companies that may not be able to survive in that situation where even though it's not discretion, they're just not there anymore or if it's not, can you provide a little bit more color about the revenue breakdown by employer size, whether how much of that is from employers with a [indiscernible] thousand plus employees versus span between 100 to a 1,000 or less, 100 to give us a sense of what might be at risk in that book.
Christa Davies: Absolutely. So as we think about our business it is globally diversified. It's diversified across clients, across industries, across geographies. We do operate in over 100 countries and no one client actually makes up even 1% of revenues and so we're very fortunate to have a very resilient business. As we look at our business in that 80% of the core, it's highly recurring, non-discretionary activity where many of these services are regulated required on necessary cost of doing business even for clients of financial distress, even for clients who are potentially entering bankruptcy, many of these services are still required, and so we have real opportunity to actually provide liquidity and capital solutions for clients in financial distress. And as we think about even client size, Dave we are very well diversified there too and so we feel good about the core part of our business being extraordinarily resilient. The 20% of our business is more discretionary. The discretionary revenues include things like project work, in risk consulting, transaction liability, human capital consulting, up travel and events business and so much of this actually recurs and renews each year, it just may have the opportunity to be deferred slightly which is what we did see in Q1 in our retirement and data analytics businesses.
Dave Styblo: Right. Okay.
Eric Andersen: So Christa, maybe just to come up on a point of that just to drive it a little bit in that like on the transaction liability it is tied to deals being closed on construction projects for bonds. It's tied to putting a shovel in the ground. So those events will eventually happen. They're just essentially been deferred until those deals come back in.
Greg Case: And also Dave, this is not a static position, remember as Christa and Eric just described, we keep evolving. So the new offerings Eric described before the new solutions, client need change. So we reinforce the 80 and then we actually change and build the 20. So it isn't just a zero-sum game and the work we do is in the investments we can make on behalf of clients and now we're going to be able to make in any scenario on the behalf of clients is a very unique position. It's also why in the end you end up seeing particularly in times of stress of like the quality, where the clients just literally come to places that they know they can get great results and great service and great capability and we're very fortunate and we're seeing a lot of that too. So there are lots of things that put us in a unique position we think to actually perform exceptionally well in the current environment or frankly any other environment one can imagine.
Dave Styblo: Okay. Great.
Eric Andersen: I think we saw that a lot in reinsurance. Certainly with the pandemic models, the ability to access capital globally and so I think you saw some of that in particular in reinsurance this quarter.
Dave Styblo: Sure. Right. That's helpful. And then maybe to shift a conversation back to the margin side, I appreciate the comments there and the flexibility to manage through revenue pressure, through operating expenses. Obviously there's a wide range of outcomes but as you've modeled this and thought through the levers that you can pull on your end how much of a revenue decline and for how long can you absorb that without margins coming under pressure year-over-year?
Christa Davies: Look it's a great question Dave and what we would say is we're not giving guidance on revenue or margins and it's obviously very uncertain both in terms of the macro impact and the duration as you described. What we have done is we have acted on position of strength and we've taken definitive steps in Q1 to reduce non-people expenses, third-party expenses, T&E, etc. and our investment in the Aon Business Services platform really enable us to do that far more effectively and far more quickly with third-party providers and we continue to do this early and ensure that we're taking those steps proactively to ensure that we can handle whatever comes in this uncertain environment and until we come out of this stronger, delivering for clients in a time they need us most and I'd finished by saying if there are potential revenue impacts in the air we've also seen somewhat early on in Q1 in our discretionary revenue then we will reduce expenses proportionally.
Dave Styblo: Okay. Thanks Christa.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Paul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for the call. You folks have made a lot, Aon has made a lot of acquisitions and divestitures in the financial crisis. How would the 80% recurring number look and compare and the business mix change from the financial crisis if we're trying to compare and contrast the two periods?
Christa Davies: Yes. Look it's a really good question Paul. And one of the things we've spent a lot of time on is, not just on the revenue on margin slide but actually on the cash side too and comparing where we are today in terms of our portfolio versus the 2008/2009 financial crisis. The thing we would say is our business is far stronger today both in terms of the overall portfolio and the recurring and non-discretionary nature of it versus the financial crisis and the Aon Business Services platform which has allowed us to reduce non-people expenses very quickly, for example 82% of our third-party spend is all managed centrally and so we were able to through our online procurement platform actually just turn off that spend and deferred payments immediately in Q1. And so we feel very good about our overall business portfolio from a revenue and sort of margin point of view but equally from a free cash flow point of view because we've been managing the company on free cash flow for well over 10 years including through the financial crisis which allows us to compare cash flow over the last couple of years by day, by line of the cash flow statement, by business and also to see how the impacts are better or worse versus the financial crisis. So we feel very good about our insight and the strength of our business to manage through. It's extremely resilient.
Eric Andersen: And remember Paul as Christa described before on these calls, as we thought about capital allocation by the way pre-crisis, at crisis, post-crisis back in 2008-2009 it really hasn't been an allocation of capital based on return of investment capital, cash on cash return, which means the businesses we brought in since the crisis by definition if you're going to meet that our higher margin, higher growth, our higher free cash flow businesses in terms of sort of what we're up to and we've also been a fair period of time done things as we thought about return of investment of capital that really has changed our ability to kind of creating a cash margin, cash flow margin against revenue overall in terms what we're trying to do. Working capital improved overtime. So the translation of cash from a dollar of revenue has also improved. So we've changed the business mix and strengthened our ability to generate cash over that period of time. So all those things contribute to a stronger Aon now than we were in 2008/2009.
Paul Newsome: No question on the margins and cash flow are higher than they were back there dramatically but I guess I was looking for particular examples that they have been changed that would have been more resilient as opposed to dramatically higher margins obviously? My second question is just an accounting one. When the insurance companies allow customers to delay payment how does that run through your income statement?
Christa Davies: So we actually haven't seen that yet full but if they were to allow because I think what we've seen in certain areas is in the consumer lines also or things like that but we haven't seen it in our business so far.
Paul Newsome: Just how is the accounting do you know yet?
Christa Davies: So we would still recognize revenue pool because we'd be placing the business. It would then be a collection of cash issue.
Paul Newsome: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Michael Phillips: Thank you. Good morning. Greg, a couple times in your comments you've mentioned the difficulty -- some of steps you're taken, the difficulty that others would have on a global basis and I assume you're part of that is the salary cut that you're talking about but I guess could you give some examples of other things that you refer to there that would be difficult for competitors to do?
Greg Case: Yes. I actually, I mean just like start with we don't make it a practice actually to comment on competitors or others. So we really shouldn't comment on them in any way shape or form. But what I would highlight is Aon and that really is that it's a place we know well, that's where we focus on every day and we would say it just step back and think about the steps we've taken to position our firm to be able to serve clients in any circumstance and protect our 50,000 colleagues, the investment in Aon United for the last decade has put us in a position where we can sit together and look across our global firm with our teams in place in every way shape or form. They come up with a point of view that they know it's right on behalf of clients and they know we can execute it now, not just because it's the right thing to do because that's just this one step but because we've come together. We actually are supporting each other in ways we haven't before and Aon Business Services allows us to execute it. So when you think about the overall package, we step back, looked at the scenarios that the economy as it’s evolving and said listen under every scenario one can imagine, particularly given the uncertainty how do we make sure we're ready and the ready is by the way the expense pieces that Christa talked about that are non [indiscernible] related and this is Aon Business Services at its best. I mean we're doing things instantly that used to take us -- you had to build consensus over time. Our teams got extraordinary capability there. We obviously did things around the buyback and M&A that are much more straightforward but what we do on Aon business services is very unique and it really supports what we do on efficiency and productivity, but it really as the team, as how they come together in every way shape or form in terms of sort of where we are and what we're up to and that's really what's been different and that's what's unique about Aon United.
Eric Andersen: Hey Greg, I think there's also another component that's worth mentioning in that, a lot of what we've done about ABS is really about leveraging our capability and getting it out globally and so we're able to deliver for clients today using our technology, being able to connect with markets, being able to connect with clients actually pulling global capability to a client virtually, in a way that actually allows them to move forward with their business, to understand the risks they've had. Certainly the things we've talked about in the past we're continuing to work on whether it's the mortgage business, whether it's building an intellectual property market, whether it's working on transaction liability type NGAs we're continuing to move forward in terms of product creation using the technology investments we've made historically trying to get in front of what we perceive as client need that's there today but also what we think is coming as people return to the workplace. So it's not just the expense side. It's actually the front end value creation that we are leveraging using the investments that we've made in technology and business services.
Michael Phillips: Okay. Great guys. Thank you very much, appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Phil Stefano of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Phil Stefano: Yes. Thanks. I appreciate the color commentary around the discretionary versus the more discretionary breakout of the business. I guess, is there any way qualitatively you can help us understand maybe a proportion of business that's dependent upon volume or number of exposure units something along those lines?
Christa Davies: I mean the place I'd start with is 80% of our business is core and our core revenue is highly recurring, non-discretionary and many of your services are regulated required and necessary cost of doing business even for businesses and financial distress or potentially going into bankruptcy. And so it is an incredibly stable and resilient business. It's globally diversified. It's diversified by industry, client, segments, etc. And then we'd say for the 20% of business is more discretionary much of this recurs and renews every year and so we do see that being actually quite strong too. There is some project work in there which could be deferred as Eric described. As we think about impacts from GDP there are obviously as I mentioned impacts from GDP or employment levels or asset values and we may see exposure to go down but we do often see clients buy more in these circumstances given the increased risk that the current crisis is highlighting to them.
Phil Stefano: Okay. From the perspective of the comp reductions, can you just help us think about the timing of this? Are there employment regulations in certain regions that maybe complicated versus other regions maybe just how we think about there -- how this might flow through from a timing perspective?
Greg Case: No Phil, back to the prior question around sort of 10 years ago, would we be able to do this without Aon United and what we are. The answer is no we're executing very, very quickly on an overall game plan to support our firm in a way under 50,000 colleagues. So we can support our clients and every single scenario one can imagine. So no actually what we've done essentially is put all these in place and we're seeing an astray kind of voluntary where [indiscernible] volunteer it's been actually done exceptionally well by country around the world with our leaders in EMEA and doing amazing work in Asia and Latin America, amazing work coming together in our U.S. and Canadian, it's just exceptional sort of frankly towards of course on leadership around the world. And so we've tailored to local markets but now the timing is immediate, are relatively immediate in terms of sort of days, weeks, not months in terms of sort of where we are. So happening very, very quickly and it's something we can do now that we couldn't have done 10 years ago, impossible. And we couldn't have executed it and actually taken some of the things Eric described and actually scale them around the globe, impossible. Today with Aon United, we not only, can do, we can do it actually in a way that actually strengthens the firm and builds the firm. We can do it in a way that protects our colleagues and our clients and we can do it in a way that candidly gives us a position to actually strengthen our firm coming out of the crisis, which is why this investment in Aon United as I said earlier has really been wonderful in positive. We're in good environments turns out this environment is really shows us that it's incredibly powerful in the more challenging environments as well and it really is accredit to our colleagues around the world. They've just been extraordinary.
Christa Davies: And look, I would say Phil, as we think about we are obviously not going to give any revenue or margin guidance but this along with other expense control measures we will, if we do see revenue declines during the year we will decrease expenses proportional with revenue as we manage through this uncertainty and so we're very focused on the incredibly stable revenue base we have as we've described and the resilient business we have to navigate through this helped serve our clients and come out of it stronger.
Phil Stefano: Good. Okay. Thanks and be well.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks. 
Greg Case: I just want to say again truly appreciate everybody participating on the call today and to our Aon colleagues around the world excited to be with you and so that we push through this environment and emerge much stronger on the other side. Talk to you soon. Thanks very much.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-31 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc’s Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc. You may begin.
Greg Case: Good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 conference call. I'm joined today in Chicago by our two Co-Presidents, Eric Andersen and Mike O'Connor, and our CFO, Christa Davies joins our discussions from London. Like previous quarters we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website so that we can focus our time on these quarterly calls to provide you more insight and a longer term view for the firm. First, let me start by recognizing the remarkable dedication of my Aon colleagues around the world. They are at the core of everything we achieve and our execution this year was impressive. Their collective efforts continue to strengthen the firm and create long term momentum reflected through a strong finish to the year with positive performance across each of our core key metrics in the fourth quarter, including 7% organic revenue growth and acceleration from the prior year on top of a strong comparable, highlighted by growth of 5% or greater in four of our five solution lines. Substantial operating margin expansion of 210 basis points and 17% EPS growth overcoming continued FX headwinds in the quarter. And a similar performance across our key metrics for the full year, highlighted by organic revenue growth of 6% for the overall portfolio, our strongest level of organic growth in over 15 years, reflecting continued acceleration of our historical trend, double-digit operating income and EPS growth, as well as record operating margin of 27.5%, and 11% growth in free cash flow delivering on our double-digit annual growth target. Our progress this year continues to reflect meaningful improvement against our objectives, which is a direct result of the strategic investments and actions we've progressively taken to achieve our potential, operating as one united global professional services firm. At this time last year we looked ahead to 2019 and shared thoughts and aspirations for our firm as we turned the page to truly enter an era at Aon United. Now, a year later, our track record, both with clients and demonstrated by our financial performance reinforces that our Aon United growth strategy is not only gaining traction, it is building momentum. We have been on our Aon United journey for over a decade and along the way you've heard us describe structural changes we have made to enable firm wide decisions and to make it easier for colleagues to work together within and across solution lines and geographies to fulfill the potential of our firm. As we out to 2020 we're excited to have formulized a clear roadmap highlighted on Page 6 of the presentation that brings renewed focus and urgency to our journey and ensures we bring the best of Aon to our clients. We call this the Aon United Blueprint. It covers four areas. Our Delivering Aon United effort that was announced last quarter translates the trust and conviction built through our decade long change effort and to a frontline client leadership program making it easier for colleagues to collaborate and better articulate client benefits of Aon United consistently in local markets. Our Aon Business Services organization capitalizes on the benefits of scale to drive operational and client service excellence. Our New Ventures Group accelerates innovation of scale to address unmet client need and expand our addressable market and our Aon Impact Model defines our calling mission and the governing behavior and shared values that shape our culture. The full potential of our firm, the idea of Aon United fits at the intersection of these four components. We are committed to working differently and Aon United Blueprint lays out how we are executing on these objectives. We know that when we consistently operate as Aon United and bring the full force of our firm to clients, we strengthen our value proposition, which translates into growth through winning more clients, doing more with existing clients and identifying scalable new ideas to bring to clients. You've already seen the trend of our organic revenue growth consistently improved over the last six years, from 3% in 2014 and 2015 to 4% in 2016 and 2017, to 5% in 2018 and now reaching 6% in 2019. The acceleration today is a proof point that the Aon United approach we are taking to better understand and address the unique needs of clients is delivering differentiated insights that help businesses make better decisions, which is why we will continue to double down on investments in industry defining content and capabilities. These investments allows us to build, buy and scale capabilities that expand our reach and address increasing demand, which we believe underpins our ability to sustainably deliver mid single digit or greater organic revenue growth over the long-term. Our outlook is driven by three categories of growth. First, is continued growth across our core portfolio as we improve client value creation driven by our Delivering and United program. As a baseline and as you've heard us highlight previously, Aon operates in global markets across risk, retirement, and health, each with demand characteristics that are increasing in both magnitude and complexity. Clients today face growing volatility and are confronting greater challenges than ever before. Against that backdrop, the unmatched investments we have made in proprietary data and analytics gives us the competitive advantage that differentiates the insights we provide to clients ultimately allowing them to make better decisions that measurably improve their business or reduce their volatility. And when you combine the power of our analytics with our breadth of expertise and Aon United behavior, we are deepening and further developing client relationships as we offer them more integrated solutions like many of the examples we have used as context during these quarterly discussions. Simply put, we win more, retain more and do more with clients. Our perfect example is the success that we have achieved within our enterprise client group. The enterprise client group dedicates leaders to bring our Aon United efforts to life with our largest most complex clients by identifying and matching our best solutions for their specific business objectives. In 2019 we drove 50% more new business generation into existing relationships with clients in this group as compared to a similar set of clients that we don't get served with a concentrated Aon United approach. And we have more than tripled the number of clients we serve in this way from approximately 50 to over 160 this year. Second, we continue to strengthen our business mix as we evolve our portfolio towards higher growth areas of client demand. We are disproportionately investing organically and inorganically in priority areas that are defined by attractive growth and margin characteristics. A great example is delegating investment management within retirement solutions, which is a $1.8 trillion market expected to grow 10% over the coming years. We have invested both organically and through our acquisition of the Townsend Group and the combined business has grown assets under management at a 34% compound annual growth rate since launching in 2010. Townsend is just one of the 86 acquisitions we made in priority areas over the last five years while divesting 84 non-core businesses. The result is a positive portfolio mix shift as organic growth rates across our priority areas are into the high single and double-digit ranges with significant potential to scale longer term. And the third category is unlocking net new opportunities with innovation of scale. Aon has a strong track record of developing first to market solutions. For instance, we have created a $24 billion premium market in U.S. mortgage reinsurance since 2012. We also created a multibillion-dollar premium market with our fully insured healthcare exchanges, both examples of connecting capital to previously uninsured risks. Our New Ventures Group is central to our success in this third category of long-term growth potential. The New Ventures Group accelerates net new innovation on behalf of clients and expands Aon's addressable market. The Group serves as an incubator to rapidly scale our most significant growth stage opportunities. Let me tell you about our latest addition to the New Ventures Group, CoverWallet, the leading digital insurance platform for small and medium sized businesses. This unique platform offers customers advice, digital application, core comparison and policy management, all online with advisors standing by to lend support. We began our relationship with CoverWallet through a pilot program in the U.S. and Australia. During the pilot, we directed a portion of our net new small business leads to CoverWallet's platform, which resulted in nearly doubling our new business growth, through increased conversion, cross-sell, and the sale of ancillary services. Penetration with existing clients increased by an impressive 20%. Recognizing the success, we are thrilled to welcome the CoverWallet team to Aon. CoverWallet is a great example of investment in differentiated capability that will serve as a building block to unlock net new opportunities in the fast-growing commercial insurance market for smaller businesses, a $200 billion global premium market with less than 5% served digitally today. In summary, we delivered a strong close to a year of significant improvement with momentum heading into 2020. As we continue to strategically position the firm, to bring the best of global Aon to clients and execute against our Aon United growth strategy. The growth profile of the firm continues to improve with further upside longer-term as we identify net new opportunities that increases the firm's total addressable market. Our team has greater conviction now than ever that the progress we have made over the last decade have made us a stronger firm, allowing us to operate differently and leading to better outcomes for clients, colleagues, communities, and shareholders. With that overview I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial progress this year and longer-term. Christa, over to you.
Christa Davies: Thanks so much Greg, and good morning everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered a strong performance across our key metrics in both the quarter and for the full year, as we continue to commercialize our Aon United strategy and demonstrate the growth potential of our firm. In the quarter we delivered 7% organic revenue growth with four out of five solution lines delivering 5% or greater. This translated into operating income growth of 12% and operating margin expansion of 210 basis points. We also delivered an incremental $54 million of restructuring savings in the quarter and have now completed 100% of the charters related to the program. Our strong growth and operational performance have enabled us to continue to fund the significant investments that Greg described across the firm to drive improved financial performance longer term. As I reflect on the full-year results, first organic revenue growth accelerated to 6% demonstrating continued improvement against our historical trend as we deliver on our goal of mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth over the long-term. All five solution lines delivered similar or improved organic growth year-over-year. I would note reported revenue was pressured throughout 2019 by an unfavorable impact from changes in FX in addition to the impact of the divestitures of certain businesses we completed within the year. Most notably was in our retirement solutions business as we continued to shift our portfolio towards the highest growth and return opportunities. Second, we delivered substantial operational improvement with operating income growth of 12% and operating margin expansion of 250 basis points to a record 27.5% margin. We delivered $169 million or a 150 basis points of incremental restructuring savings for the full-year, reflecting approximately 100 basis points of core margin improvement. I would note this includes the absorption of significant investments to support long-term growth, as we continue to deliver client value in the core, shift the portfolio to higher growth and high margin areas, and innovative scales to unlock net new markets. And we expect to continue to invest heavily in 2020 in some of our most attractive opportunities. We translated strong operational performance into double-digit EPS growth of 12% overcoming a headwind from FX translation and a higher effective tax rate within the year compared to the prior-year periods. FX rates continue to have an unfavorable impact on result in the fourth quarter, due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar, which has cumulatively resulted in an insignificant net unfavorable impact of approximately $0.23 for the full year 2019 or a $68 million unfavorable impact on operating income. If currency remained stable at today's rates, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.6 per share for the full year 2020 with $0.05 of unfavorable impact or approximately $15 million of operating income expected in the first quarter of 2020 due to a stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro. Regarding our restructuring program, I'm pleased to report that all charges related to the program have been incurred and the program is now closed. We delivered 529 million of annualized savings in 2019 and now expect to deliver $580 million of annualized savings in 2020, reflecting an increase of $45 million from our last estimate of $535 million. I would note that incremental savings expected in 2020 will be spread throughout the year and reported as part of overall operational improvement. The total program reflects a cash investment of $1485 million and is expected to deliver return on investment of 39% before any reinvestments. There are approximately $200 million of remaining cash outlays related to the program of which $180 million are expected to be incurred in 2020 before declining substantially thereafter. Beyond the formal restructuring program, we will continue to identify efficiencies, drive improved productivity and enable growth of the firm as we unlock additional operating leverage through our Aon Business Services' single operating model. Aon Business Services is our platform to deliver operations, technology and vendor management across the firm, capitalize on the benefits of scale, and drive operational and client service excellence. As an example, earlier this year, I provided insight into our efforts within Aon Business Services to move to a single CRM platform called Aon Connect, which standardizes our client facing sales process and creates a more holistic view of how to best serve clients across our firm. The platform also provides Aon colleagues with a more comprehensive view of each client's accounts, including information on existing relationships and insights in the client discovery process, which allows us to improve our pipeline and jeopardy processes. As we ramped up usage of Aon Connect throughout 2019, our sales pipeline values have increased materially. In some businesses, our pipeline increased 30% year-over-year in Q4. Having a robust sales platform integrated into the business is contributing to increase win rates and penetration across solution lines with existing clients. In 2019 usage of the platform was directly correlated to record new business wins in the U.S. This is an example of how a business platform within Aon Business Services combining technology with best practices is supporting our Aon United growth strategy through enabling long-term growth and improved operating leverage. Looking to 2020 and beyond, ongoing productivity improvements, accelerating revenue growth, and a portfolio mix shift to higher margin businesses are expected to drive continued long-term margin expansion, noting that we've delivered 70 to 80 basis points of operating margin improvement on average per year over the last decade. Lastly, free cash flow increased by $164 million or 11% to $1.61 billion, primarily reflecting strong operational performance. We achieved our target double-digit annual growth despite approximately $130 million of net cash outflows related to certain litigation settlements that will create a tailwind to 2020. As we think about cash flow generation going forward, we are focused on maximizing the translation of accelerating revenue growth into the highest level of free cash flow in three ways; operating income growth, continued progress of working capital initiatives, and structural uses of cash winding down significantly in 2020 and 2021. Declining uses of cash, restructuring CapEx and pension collectively are expected to free up over $455 million of free cash flow by the end of 2021 as shown on Page 24 of our presentation. This adds significant upside to our base of approximately $1.61 billion of free cash flow in 2019, plus when the operating income growth or working capital improvements. Together these inputs give us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit annual growth in free cash flow over the long-term. We have the opportunity to substantial incremental debt capacity while maintaining our current leverage ratios as restructuring expenses are now complete and pension liability continues to improve. This provides significant financial flexibility over the coming years to further invest in value creation or return capital to shareholders. We are diligent about maximizing ROIC and make all capital allocation decisions on this basis. This is highlighted by the 2 billion of share repurchase in 2019 which remains our highest return on capital investment given our free cash flow valuation. I would highlight, return on invested capital continues to improve as we shape the portfolio with 190 basis point increase year-over-year to 23.5% driven by operating income growth and a reduction in capital. I would note the 23.5% ROIC is the highest the firm has had in its history. In summary, full year results reflect strong performance on all four key metrics driven by our Aon united strategy. We continue to accelerate organic growth, delivered record operating margin, and achieved double-digit EPS and free cash flow, all while making significant investments to improve the growth profile of the firm. We have returned nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends in 2019. This success provides momentum as we head into 2020 and supports our expectation of continued long-term shareholder value creation. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Speakers, our first question is from Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Dave Styblo: Hi, good morning and thanks for the questions and for the update. Greg, I wanted to start out with a broader question on ABS and maybe the next set of key initiatives that you guys are working on over the next two to three years here. Obviously, one of the focal points you talked about on that is, is how that can be used to support your long-term margin goal of 70 to 80 basis points. I'm curious as, how much of that can help support that initiative as well as some of the benefits on the revenue side? I know Christa will start to get at that, but maybe if you could shed a little bit more color on how those efforts can help accelerate the revenue growth from here as well?
Greg Case: Happy to do that Dave and maybe I'll talk at sort of overall level of focus and Christa, you can embellish a little bit on sort of the direct impact on sustainable margins as well. I think Dave it's important to step back. At the core of our strategy to grow Aon has been this conversation that we've been in for a long time around Aon United, and we have the external part of that which is really the parts facing the market, meaning we are more consistently delivering the best of our firm to clients and by the way that's easier to say, everyone says it, it is very hard to do, but it benefits clients and colleagues immensely and you're seeing that show up on the top line. But, to exactly to your point on Aon Business Services, equally compelling is asking the question, how can we be world class to client service. And if you think about it, most of all industries have done this. All parts of financial services, manufacturing, have set out to address this challenge at a companywide level, but no one in our industry has ever done this. And the reason is, again because it is really hard. And in essence we undertook investment to establishing our business services that takes truly proven practice from sectors all around the world and then delivers it into our world and again never really been done. It is a pretty bold step. And if you think about, this is really Aon United from the inside of the firm and delivering Aon United is the external facing piece. But this inside piece you're highlighting is really important. We have absorbed a lot of disruption intentionally, single operating model, single outgo, single brand and in the end there are four things that come out of this. And one is, to your point, better client service in a coordinated way and Christa described the example on some of the client connect piece, but beyond that is greater efficiency for sure, by the way it didn’t start with efficiency, we started with client service. Equally important is accelerated innovation. I mean if you think about it, if we actually found a hypothetically a block chain solution and how long would it take us to implement it, 10 years ago it would have taken us a long time, multiple years. Now actually with Aon Business Services we've got a way to accelerate innovation, but then directly to your point, it's about continuous improvement. This is a platform we've invested in and which allows us to actually get better and better and better over time. And again we could never have done it without the incremental investment and as Christa highlighted we got a 39% return on it, but it wasn’t the return that was important. It was the foundation that is in place and we're very pleased about the progress, more to come, but we're more excited about the potential around margin expansion in 2021 and beyond and also what it can do from a client standpoint. But Christa, we've talked very specifically about some of the opportunities there and in essence and lots of examples too. And maybe before Christa we'll go to Eric just as a quick example to just what shows up every day.
Eric Andersen: Yes, great. It is great to be here. I wanted to maybe tell a quick story to bring to light for you how this actually works in practice and I use our reinsurance business as a way to describe it. Over the last 12 months our reinsurance team has been building a center of excellence within our ABS business to provide cap modeling and advisory services in a low cost location. Now what essentially it has done is it has created a standard across the entire business around the world and it has provided professional high end analytics. It has also allowed the senior advisory team within the teams across the world to spend more time with their clients and it has provided more structuring support, more advice on how actually to approach reinsurance transactions. And so you get a better standard of information and then obviously free up the time of the teams to be able to spend more time with clients. That's driven more retention. It has driven higher new business wins and it has actually been a great value add to the client.
Greg Case: And if I could add, you coming on this too, it is not - that was a reinsurance improvement, but that reinsurance improvement now gets translated into what, order means recommends a risk or would it mean story time, because we're actually learning best practices across the firm in ways we could never before.
Eric Andersen: Yes, that information gets scaled in these by commercial clients, reinsurance clients, almost to anybody that needs that type of analytics.
Greg Case: So that's very different, but Christa, on the margin side, what are you thinking?
Christa Davies: Yes, so Aon Business Services has absolutely enabled us to strengthen the platform and strengthen our ability to drive margin expansion long-term. It has enabled us to drive productivity through our investments and platforms, centers of excellence and third-party partnerships. And one good example of that is, in 2019 we eliminated 600,000 hours of manual effort and also measured this in our centers of excellence and throughout third-party partnerships. And so, we're continuing to make improvement in it and it makes the sustainability of our continued margin expansion even stronger.
Dave Styblo: Okay thanks. Maybe something a little bit near-term on the cost saves, the new $580 million target for this year implies the margin tail one of about 40 to 50 basis points. Is it fair for us to think about margins this year being better than the 70 to 80 basis point long-term goal or are you guys thinking of using a good chunk of the cost savings for reinvestments?
Christa Davies: Yes, it's a really good question Dave. And what we would say is, we're in a much stronger place in terms of margin expansion as a result of the investments we've made in restructuring in Aon Business Services in particular. And so, if you looked over the last 10 years you'd say that our average has been 70 to 80 basis points. Having said that, our gross margin expansion for the last couple of years has been way in excess of that and will be in 2020 and 2021. Having said that, we will invest significantly in growth opportunities because we've got a number of very, very attractive areas of investment and so when we're not giving forward margin guidance Dave, but what I will tell you is the gross margin expansion is significantly in excess of 70 to 80, and then really get netted by investments we make in fantastic growth areas.
Dave Styblo: Okay, thanks. And I know I have asked this before a little a little bit, but the mechanics, so when you're exiting the fourth quarter of 2019 at $162 million run rate and you annualize that, you want to put something closer to $650 million and that's well above the $580 million target. So what am I not understanding about the mechanics there as to why there is a discrepancy between those two numbers?
Christa Davies: Yes, look it's a great question Dave, and I certainly understand the math that you're doing. However, when we think about it, we really think about it in annual savings time. So our cumulative savings in 2019 of $529 million and our cumulative savings in 2020 of $580 million, and so we're driving substantial savings year-over-year as a result of the actions we took in 2019. And so, you've got a $50 million year-over-year benefit. And obviously those restructuring savings as well as the core margin expansion drove record margins in 2019 of 27.5%, which we're extremely excited about.
Dave Styblo: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment please, for the next question. Thank you. Speakers, our next question is from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your line is open.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to start with a comment about buybacks being the best ROIC opportunity. Is that a function of sort of asking prices in terms of M&A being too high or your view of the intrinsic value of your stock price, just some color on that would be helpful?
Christa Davies: Delighted to do it Suneet. So we manage the firm on return on capital, cash-on-cash return. And as we look at the return on capital and all the opportunities we have, whether that's M&A investment or organic investment or debt pay down or pension contributions, return on capital of buyback is the highest return on capital across the firm. And it's really based on our discounted cash flow of the firm and the sustainability of the free cash flow outlook going forward and how much we think that's going to grow. And so, look, we definitely see attractive areas in M&A Suneet. We certainly see organic investment being extremely attractive, and some of our highest return on capital opportunities have been organic investments we've made in the firm, like the healthcare exchanges, like data analytics, like delegated investment management, big three. But what we would say is, it's really about the free cash flow growth long-term and the sustainability of that. And so our DCF values are substantially above where we're trading today which is why the return on capital buyback is still so high.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. And then maybe a quick follow-up on that is, you had mentioned debt capacity as another lever in your tool kit. Given the difference between your DCF value and the current stock price, is the idea of using some of that capacity to accelerate share repurchases something that you would consider?
Christa Davies: The way we think about it, Suneet is, our debt to EBITDA ratio and our current investment grade rating is incredibly important to us. And as EBITDA grows and our unfunded pension liability comes down, we'll add debt keeping the leverage ratio the same. And so, really it's about making decisions on an ROIC basis, and so that could be buyback, that could be organic investment, it could be M&A, but we'll continue to keep that leverage ratio the same based on the importance of our current investment grade rating both to our clients and to our financial flexibility.
Suneet Kamath: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Paul Newsome: Good morning, congratulations on the quarter.
Greg Case: Good morning.
Christa Davies: Thank you.
Paul Newsome: I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the organic growth that we saw this quarter, which I think is better than most expected. Could you talk a little bit about what you see is the tailwind in pricing and maybe focus a little bit on the reinsurance sector, which obviously had a really big increase, were there anything in there that was one-time in nature, any big wins that kind of stuff, both in the reinsurance and across the other businesses as well?
Greg Case: Happy Paul to talk about sort of what's driven sort of the overall growth profile. And again, both Christa and I reflected, that's actually been a trend. It's across the portfolio that's been going on for a number of years. But I will come back to reinsurance, I would say reinsurance obviously is the smallest quarter by far we have. We'll come back to the overall piece, and we'd actually reflect on the overall year. And to start off with, the impact from pricing as you highlighted is evident, but not material, again evident, but not material in our full-year organic of 6%. That's true in reinsurance and that's true in commercial risk. And if you think about it, half of our revenue base is not impacted by pricing at all and certainly on the risk side, the retirement business, the health, the data analytics business, so take half of it out against the 6%, completely. And then you sort of say the remaining piece that's left on the risk side, a third of that is fee-based, so two-thirds commission, one-third fee-based. And by the way some of those commission-based revenues, particularly in larger clients are capped, so it's more like a fee. So in essence, you start with the impact overall, is evident as I said, but not material. Equally important is, the work we do, I mean, we are built to serve clients in changing rate environments and the work that we do really changes their behavior. So there is not a direct linear correlation at all. What we would say, if you step back, what's driving our progress? Our progress is really driven around new business, more clients, new clients, retention and rollover. And rollover, by the way, might be the place where the price might show up, but it really is about new business and retention. I ticked a couple of things off quickly and then maybe flip it to Eric and Mike on sort of just any additional thoughts here. But on the reinsurance side, and particularly for the year, again that's 10% for the year. We feel very good about it. But 60% of that growth, call it $89 million, $90 million, was a pure trading net new. And then you got net new on fact and you've got net new on ILS, insurance-linked securities and essentially this is really a net new opportunity with exceptional retention rates. And the same story really across the commercial risk portfolio. I'll pick one -- frankly one sector we could pick it anywhere around the world. In US brokerage we had retention rates at 95% and then $170 million of net new in the quarter, overall for the year it's 10% year-over-year and 17% up in Q4. So this is a net new phenomena for us, a retention phenomena for us. And this is back to the idea of Aon United and what we're doing to strengthen our overall portfolio. And again, I'll ask Eric or Mike to comment on it, but some of these pieces are about how we expand, what we do inside the solution piece versus overall. But Eric, thought on that.
Eric Andersen: Sure. Maybe, and maybe I'll start with sort of some of the market dynamics and then Mike, you can cover off some of the client pieces. I think from a market dynamics, what we're seeing is a bit of a flight to quality. In that, if you think about what we do on the insurance side for these clients, we help them on risk identification first and foremost. We then work with them on risk mitigation, which is how do they actually handle the risk without going into the market to trade it. And we've made a lot of significant investments in the data and analytics side there to help them understand their risk without actually ever going to the insurance market. And then finally, if you do go to the insurance market, our teams global access to capital, our ability to provide insight, structuring ideas, benchmarking, all of the things that we've been talking about over the last couple of years in terms of investment into the business, actually allows our teams to be able to help them manage through what is a transitioning market. And I would say, maybe one last comment before I throw it over to Mike, Greg, on the fact piece, is that the facultative business is tied pretty closely in certain parts of the world, certainly Latin America on how the primary market goes, whether it's the insurers themselves looking to transition some of their portfolio risks on an individual client basis or its clients themselves looking to access the global capital anywhere. Now as Greg said, we're going to build for it and our teams have been working really closely over the last several years to be able to effectively get ready for this moment. Mike maybe a couple of comments on what the clients are actually doing.
Michael O'Connor: Yes, and thanks Eric. And maybe I'd share one in this environment that comes to mind, I think it's really interesting and it brings to life some of what we're talking about of how we bring Aon United and deliver it to a client. And this example is where we actually brought a full range of capabilities from our cyber solutions team to help this client. And as Greg mentioned, our enterprise client leader model that we've rolled out, this is a situation where an enterprise client leader was working with our cyber solutions team and really challenged the team to think about what we could do for this client. This is a pretty sophisticated global financial services client. And the team stepped back and invested the time to understand the clients' posture around the globe, their capabilities, where they were at and said how do we augment and supplement what that client is doing? And we came forward with a global solution around cyber risk assessment, impact, quantification, our ability to help them with security testing and incident response. Net global proposition resonated with this client and left the client in a better position in terms of their readiness to basically respond to any incident that happened. And for me, that’s a great example of our team making Aon United come to life for our client within a solution line and bringing more of Aon to that client to have more impact.
Greg Case: So in that example Mike, literally three years ago if we had to place cyber policy, we had it, it have been great, we would have declared victory, it would have been awesome. And now we literally had a conversation that really is much broader. We're serving the client differently. We're bringing more of the enterprise client leader really asked for all this. The piece and the good news is, even if this client says they don't really want it, they just want a cyber policy, they actually see us differently because we're talking about their holistic business. In this case it worked out much better than that. But in any event, Paul does that give you a sense, I mean, literally, what's driving our - the action here is really net new and retention. Again, we want to reflect the pricing is evident, but it's not material in the overall story and this gets to the sustainability and what Aon United means at the client level.
Paul Newsome: No, absolutely. And this is a related question, obviously Aon United has a piece of here of cost cutting and efficiencies, which I think are pretty easy, relatively easy for us to see as outsiders, but a lot of your examples are sort of essentially cross selling examples. How is it as an outsider should we sort of measure that change? And maybe you could talk about your internal measures as well in that respect?
Greg Case: Well, listen, we'd come back to, I would encourage you again. On Page 6, we've got this blueprint laid out, it's got some pieces to it. One of the pieces, is how do we deliver our firm at the front line delivering Aon United at the front line? We built a tremendous amount of infrastructure to try to support behind that things that help our colleagues understand the firm Aon IQ. The client tracking piece that Christa described, all these things go into sort of how we make it easier for our colleagues to deliver the firm. The translation of that is really simple, growth. So you're looking to grow and at the end of the day we're not actually serving clients more effectively and doing more with them, what are we doing? And by the way that's got to be value-driven. That's not a price driven effort, that's a value-driven effort. How do we create more value for clients? We create more value. They understand it. We're going to do fine against that. So in essence, you look at the top line and understand what we're doing on top line and how that's evolving over time. And then, you basically then look at Aon Business Services, Christa described it and we described it as well, that's another means for us to actually be better, the cap [indiscernible] example that Eric gave, was really into how you serve clients better. Those clients are actually getting better content than they've ever gotten before. Our colleagues have to be comfortable and trust that over time and see a build and now we're actually getting better and better. So clients are seeing better content, again back to growth. And then Aon Business Services obviously creates operating leverage because it creates efficiency and that means we can invest more back into the business. But the translation, when you think about the question of how we're doing, it really is the simple things Christa was describing, organic growth, the operating leverage we have in the business, which translates into the margin improvement. And then you follow our story. It hasn't changed. Its free cash flow generation and delivering on our double-digit free cash flow growth year after year after year and as Christa highlighted, the Aon United effort has substantially strengthen our ability to deliver on that promise, which is going to be great for our clients, great for our colleagues and of course we think very, very good for our shareholders.
Paul Newsome: Thank you and congratulations on the quarter.
Greg Case: We appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Mike Zaremski: Hey, good morning. Christa did you talk about the tax rate? I'm thinking into 2020 and I see it was, it was lower than expected this quarter and maybe that had to do with the incorporation to Ireland?
Christa Davies: So Mike, what we would say is, we don't give tax guidance going forward. As I look back historically, exclusive of the impact of discrete items, which can be positive or negative in the quarter, our historic underlying rate has been 18% for the last three years. And what you saw in the quarter Mike, was some positive discrete and the change in the geographic distribution of income. But really 17.5% for the full year, which is dangerously close to the 18% we've seen for the previous three years. The Ireland move will be concluded on the 31st of March and it's really about preserving capital structure and financial flexibility.
Mike Zaremski: Okay. And just to think about free cash flow on tax too, is the cash tax rate, is that - should be similar?
Christa Davies: It should be similar, yes. You're always going to have a slight difference in timing Mike between your GAAP tax rates and your cash tax rate because of settlements with tax authorities around the world. So there'll be some disconnect in timing, but in general it is the same.
Mike Zaremski: Okay, great. And my last question is on, maybe CoverWallet and small to mid space at a higher level, does CoverWallet take balance sheet risk like a carrier or is it essentially a broker? And I guess strategically, it sounds like Aon would like to do more in the small to medium space. So is that a kind of strategic priority M&A wise, and would you consider kind of getting into the more plain vanilla – small mid U.S. brokerage space, like some of your competitors are in?
Greg Case: We will start with the balance sheet, Christa.
Christa Davies: Yes, so Mike, let me just take the balance sheet piece and then I'll hand to Greg to the sort of more of the overall growth opportunity, which we think is fantastic. So Mike, as a company we do not take balance sheet risk. So this is in the same brokerage MGA space that we play in every single day and so, we're professional services firm. We're in the business of delivering great service to the clients and getting rewarded through performance fees, through straight fees, and through commissions and we do not take balance sheet risk in this business or in any other part of our business. But Greg, over to you on the small business opportunity, which is fantastic.
Greg Case: Right and that is highly consistent Mike. We have already been and that's what we're going to do. We love bringing content and capability. We're then essentially matching capital with risk around the world and the capital we match is obviously insurance capital but all types of capital. So if you think about a changing world, whether it's small businesses or to climate change, do anything you want to think about, intellectual property wherever it is, we're matching capital at risk and using content to do that. That's the essence of what our firm is all about. And the beauty of that is – that demand on that is getting higher and higher. That brings you to CoverWallet and CoverWallet is just a wonderful example of really high, high end, high quality content capability that addresses small and mid-sized businesses and again this is scalable capability. In essence it's initially the application against $200 billion small commercial market growing at 6% less than 5% or so digitally and the opportunity to really grow that market over time. Although the expectations are that a quarter of that market might be digital by 2023. So this is a massive growth opportunity to serve clients in an effective way, CoverWallet is going to be central to that in terms of sort of, what we're up to and what we're doing and we're looking forward to that. You also asked about mid-market, I would say listen, 80% of what we do around the globe is mid-market. So in essence, we've always been mid market, continue to drive mid-market and certainly this has applications in that realm as well. We're serving large companies medium-size companies and smaller companies and then CoverWallet is really a means for us to sort of dig into that in a very, very strong way. And then the digital assets that are brought to bear too we think have applications, much broader. So this is a great example of content and capability that's scalable. A lot of our acquisitions that Christa was describing really M&A if we're going to be, buyback because of our view of relative undervalued stock, if we're going to beat that return on invested capital, it's actually not getting bigger, it has to be getting better and CoverWallet helps us get better. I mean, this is content that we can scale and that actually has a very high return on invested capital. So that's the essence of it in terms of where we are and the overall perspective. Did that make sense?
Mike Zaremski: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question is on free cash flow. So it is my understanding, I guess, you're looking for double digits in 2020 double-digits growth sorry. Is that off of – if we adjust the 2019 free cash flow level for all the restructuring cash that ran through? Just trying to get a sense of the base that we should think about using as you look to grow double-digits this year?
Christa Davies: Yes, great question Elyse. So it's up to $1.61 billion base for 2019, which is essentially sort of the GAAP cash flow statement, cash flow from operations less CapEx, that's your starting point. And so we’ll grow double digits in 2020 and we'll grow double digits in 2021, driven by three key things. The first is operating income growth. The second is working capital initiatives. And the third is declining uses of cash, which you see on Page 37 of the PowerPoint.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, that's helpful. In terms of organic growth, as we think about 2020, you guys seem pretty bullish on the growth prospects. I'm just trying to think, is there any seasonality that we should be thinking about with any of the quarters that growth might be skewed heavier either earlier or later in the year relative to any of the four quarters?
Greg Case: There are patterns that we can highlight. What we need to come back to Elyse it's really the overall year and the portfolio. So we start with our growth thesis its overall year and the portfolio. So in essence this is the 3%, 3%, 4% 4%, 5% now 6%. And what we've essentially said is we want to achieve mid-single digit or greater growth over the long term. And we've put in place a number of things to make that happen, that we think will continue to improve and grow and strengthen our ability to do that in our position to do that. Obviously, some of our solution lines have different patterns in terms of sort of where we go back and forth, which we can highlight Christa maybe you want to highlight some of those. But net-net, what we're essentially saying is we want to grow at mid single-digit or greater, and we're investing to do that, and you've seen that track record continue to play out.
Christa Davies: And Elyse, in terms of quarterly patterning Q1 and Q4 are our strongest quarters, Q1 being our largest quarter of the year since revenue recognition and Q1 is really much more reinsurance and EMEA strong quarter and Q4 is really a U.S. Retail and Health sort of strong quarter. So there the three biggest quarters will be Q3 is our seasonally weakest quarter.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, that's helpful. And then my last question, following the reincorporation to Ireland, I think you said that's going to take place at the end of March. I'm just trying to understand, will there be anything preventing you guys from issuing intercompany loans out of Ireland? I'm just wondering if there's any kind of - anything that we need to pay attention to there?
Christa Davies: Elyse, really the move to Ireland is really about maintaining a stable corporate structure and financial flexibility. It won't result in any change to Aon's current business operations. The move is really about remaining in the European Union single market. And so, it won't change any of our debt structuring internally or externally, or any of our operations.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning, everybody. My first question probably ties into Elyse's previous question on free cash flow. So how confident are you in the ability to achieve the double-digit annual growth in 2020 considering that projected year-over-year improvement in cash uses, it's actually declined by almost $250 million relative to the initial expectation?
Christa Davies: Yes Yaron, we're extremely confident about achieving double-digit growth in 2020 and 2021 and beyond. If you think about 2020 in particular you have $130 million of tailwind from legacy litigation that's flowing into 2020 for a start. And then you do have declining uses of cash of pension and restructuring into 2020 as you can see on Page 37 of the PowerPoint. So, just those two numbers alone are substantial that's before you get to strong operational improvement and working capital initiatives, which drove the majority of the growth in 2019.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And was that the litigation, would that still be the same answer?
Christa Davies: Yes, absolutely.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And then I guess going back to Paul's previous question, is there any way to quantify how much of a cross-sell opportunity Aon United is driven maybe as a percentage of the 6% organic growth for the year?
Greg Case: Yes Yaron, again we would suggest we would come back. This is less - we don't think about it as cross sell. We think about it as client leadership and client development. And again a lot of the conversations we have aren't about sort of the next product. It's about how you understand client need more effectively, address client needs. Sometimes you sell product, sometimes you have a great conversation and the client sees you differently and retention changes. Sometimes they see you differently, they don't buy that, but they buy something else or the current stuff, they actually feel better about the value you bring and you actually deliver greater value, they understand and pay you more for that. So this shows up in many, many different ways. You get this behavior in the water and watch our team do what they do and it's wonderful to see. We know this works. We know it's incredibly powerful. It works on new. It works on retention, it works on rollover and Aon United is all about how we scale it and actually how we put the mechanisms in place to do it more and more across the firm and then continue to keep better and better at it. And then at the end - you're going to – it shows up in top line revenue and it shows up in operating leverage because it shows up in Aon Business Services as well. And you see it in top line, do you see it in margin and you see it then in the translation to free cash flow. So that's how we'd like you to think about it. That's how we think about it. Obviously, we've got more detail behind that operationally, but that's fundamentally as what we're all about and what we're looking to try to do. And in our view, in the end this is what's driving sustainable mid single-digit growth over time and now pieces around that. But Eric and Mike, in terms of how it shows up in the field?
Eric Andersen: Yes, I think a great tangible example of it is the enterprise client group. And this is a group of client leaders within Aon across the world actually invest heavy time to understand the ins and outs of each individual client and then they work within all the solution lines to either to be able to craft products or services Greg, as you mentioned or they work together to create something different and something new to add real value to the client. So again, it's hard to quantify based on each individual solution line, but that interaction with the client really could be very special and add great value for us with that relationship.
Yaron Kinar: Just looking at the overall organization, is there any way of thinking of the move from 3% to 4% to 5% to 6% organic growth, how much of that has come through Aon United specifically?
Greg Case: We don't want to, we don't want you to do that. Aon United is what we are. It's not a separate thing. It’s the fabric of the firm. It's the nature of the conversation. So the 3% to 4% is part new, by the way, net news-record, new record in terms of reinsurance, new record in terms of commercial risk on the retirement on the health side. Aon United is about retention, clients we might have lost, we're not losing now. By the way the conversations we're having with clients around, if you're out of RFP, why are we better, it's a different conversation. By the way, anybody can say what we're saying, but who has done single OpCo, single brand single – basically single operating system, who is doing Aon Business Services? The answer was no one. So if it has value, clients go wow! This actually makes a difference. So we don't want this to be separate. We want this to be integral to what we do every day. And then if it shows up in top line and margin, and it shows up in free cash flow, our hope is you'll be very comfortable with that overall outcome.
Mike O'Connor: Yes. And Greg, maybe I'd add, the example you brought, which I think really brings at the life for me is, think of the situation where we bring a new idea to a client. And it's a great conversation, exciting solution that can help them with a material issue, but they - actually it's not the right time, they don’t buy it. Our team comes back and celebrates that. Our team comes back into the clients looking at us differently, are thinking about it differently. And ultimately that helps us long-term that's delivering Aon United, and for us, we do that time and time again and good things are going to happen for the client in terms of us helping them and helping us grow with that client return.
Greg Case: But the hard metrics are literally net new, retention, rollover, and then everything sort of is derivative against that, that drives overall top line, and it cuts by the way across solution lines and then within solution lines. And by the way, a lot of Aon United is doing more with clients in risk, doing more with clients and retirement, doing more with clients and health, and then occasionally understanding their needs and their issues and thinking across our solution lines. So these are that the types of things the team is doing and we're doing more and more momentum around it.
Yaron Kinar: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS. Your line is open.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. I've got two questions, the first one, Greg. I'm just curious, if we look at retirement solutions is clearly the one that's been lag from an organic revenue growth, and I understand there's some structural headwinds in certain parts of that business. But I guess my question is, could you get that business to a mid-single digit plus organic revenue growth rate kind of sustainably, and if so, what is it going to take to get it there? And what are the things that you're doing to get it there?
Greg Case: Well listen, we do. In all of our solution lines we believe in the end, our mid-single digit are greater over time. And I would just start high level and maybe Christa you could get your thoughts on this as well. But step back is about fundamental demand Brian global world retirement, 20% of the world is ready for retirement, 80% is not. Fundamentally, this is a massive, massive sort of pool of demand that if you can address on behalf of clients, you can make a huge difference. And we've talked about it before when you juxtaposed retirement and health. All of our clients, have employees, their employees almost by definition on average are overspending on health and understanding on retirement, and that's an incredibly in city set of behaviors that over the course of a decade or two makes a difference in the life of the family. Now if we could actually help them adjust that, one or two degrees. Hugely, hugely powerful and then there were pieces inside of what we're doing on the retirement side, like delegated et cetera that are incredibly powerful and actually we're investing very, very heavily behind, but Christa thoughts on that as well?
Christa Davies: Absolutely right, Greg, that's where I was going to explain Brian. I think there is an enormous portfolio mix shift going on within retirement. What you really see is we divested a lower growth talent business earlier in the year that was a drag on organic through the first half of 2019. We've been investing heavily in high-growth areas like delegated investment management, which Greg talked about, which is growing double-digits for us, and in human capital, which is again growing high single to low double digits for us, and as these scale will become a bigger part of the mix in retirement overall and for Aon overall, and we're really confident that retail will become a mid-single-digit growth or greater part of our portfolio over time.
Brian Meredith: Got you, thank you.
Greg Case: And maybe one last comment, Christa because I agree the human capital business has really performed well in the second half. There are also things that are happening legislatively like the Secure Act, which actually gives opportunities especially in North America around multi-employer grouping to be able to do more efficient pension opportunities that we actually think there is great opportunity for them especially in North America going into ’20 and ‘21.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then my second question Greg, Aon United has done a great job in delivering extra value or more value to customers and I guess my question is, have you been able to boost yield or at least what you're charging for your service. As I know that there was a conversation several years ago. We were talking about trying to do that. Has that happened? How much of that is contributing do you think to this organic growth and do we think that could be a tailwind going forward?
Greg Case: Yes, this is Greg. I really appreciate that because this is really at the heart of what we're trying to think about and it really is about a value conversation with our clients. No kidding, value. And in essence, if we use the example, of we cost a dollar, and we actually create value for clients that translates into $2 of value, and somebody else comes in and says, I can do what you're doing for $0.50, but it translates into $0.52. If our client understands the value, really understands by the better operating performance, stronger financial position less volatility, whatever the source of value, Brian if it's quantifiable, clients understand it. There were thrilled to pay for it, because it creates real value for them. If we don't do a great job and we're not adequate in describing the value, shame on us. Right? That's the issue. By the way, that's a high bar. And that's what Aon United is all about. How do we get a little better every year at describing value? By the way, asking ourselves, are we really providing the value if we're not investing behind it? And this is where we are back to kind of we're investing in content, intellectual capital, the CoverWallet example, [indiscernible] and these are content laden investments that we can scale the clients to create more value. We create more value and we get better at articulating it, we're going to get paid for it. And clients are going to be happier. And there are countless examples of that, Brian. We know it works. Question is how do we scale it? And that's how Aon United is different. And look, we're making a decision. We're doing some things different. What we're doing and delivering Aon United at the front line is different. It requires different behavior. What we're doing on Aon Business Services is different. It requires different behavior. Turns out that behavior has tremendous benefits for clients and great economic leverage if we can scale it. And if we do, we can continue to do, we will get better and better. But that's how we thought about it. And we've had great success at the micro level, what we want to see is more and more success over time at the macro level across the firm. And that's the essence of the evolution of Aon United.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning and most of my questions were answered. But just to clarify, you gave the rationale for the domicile change to Ireland being capital and operational flexibility, but should we assume any benefit on your tax rate or does the tax rate or would it not change at all?
Christa Davies: It will not change at all.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay, and then on pricing, you mentioned that it's been a little bit of benefit recently. Obviously a lot of your business is dependent on pricing, but what are you seeing out there in both the commercial and reinsurance markets? It seems like brokers commentary has gotten more positive recently, but how broad based do you think the pricing improvement is by region and/or by line?
Greg Case: And again, we don't view it as positive or negative, we viewed it sort of it is a price per unit, and we understand it and then we react to it. And we reacted on behalf of clients. So in essence, when price changes or per unit cost changes per unit of risk, we're helping clients understand how to change programs to lifetime programs Eric mentioned, this is exactly what we're built for. The data analytics we have allow us to change programs, relay our programs, bring in different markets, think about risk differently. So in essence, we're constantly adapting to that on behalf of clients. And that's what we said for us the impact on pricing was there, was evident, but it was not material.
Jimmy Bhullar: And but what are you seeing just as an observer in the market that sort of is an unbiased viewer of the market, what are you seeing in terms of pricing trends overall and how it evolved as 2019 went, as you went through 2019?
Greg Case: You're seeing pressure here and there were there have been specific cats, where there have been specific issues over time. But remember, there's others. When you think about macro supply and demand of capital, there's a massive amount of capital out there that continues to be in the overall marketplace. So, globally across the market, a lot of capital out there. By the way, our view is ironically, there is a lot more risk out there, that’s been addressed. So there's opportunities to sort of help clients and support their needs, but there's pressure of late based on some of the things that are happening around the world and the catastrophes around the world, but net-net, we see an abundance of capital and an opportunity to help clients address their risk needs.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open.
Meyer Shields: Thanks, good morning. I had a question about CoverWallet and the context is that, in the U.S. direct to consumer auto insurance is that much lower penetration than we've seen in the number of other countries. And I'm wondering whether that's a constraint at least in the near-term on CoverWallet’s growth?
Greg Case: Yes, Meyer, this is broader than direct to auto. This is really sort of if you think about small companies, small businesses, and their broad based set of risk needs, how do you address those risk needs more holistically, and then how do you do it with an incredibly efficient platform underpinned by world class data and analytics. So that really is the thesis. And we've actually as I described before, we spent a great deal of time with CoverWallet in pilot mode before they actually became part of the overall Aon family. And we're quite optimistic about the opportunities here to help smaller companies succeed in ways they haven't before, understand their risk better, mitigate their risk more effectively, and that really is the essence of what CoverWallet it's about.
Meyer Shields: No, I understand that and it's helpful. I'm trying to get a sense of to whether they are kind of sort of like cultural impediments domestically to adopting direct to in this case enterprise insurance distribution?
Greg Case: No, I think it's less about cultural impediments is more around, is there a compelling value proposition that a small business would understand, would value and would pay for. And if you get that combination, right, and I said, well, this is a great way for me to understand risk in my business, get an overall solution that's actually very cost effective that I can understand that by the way delivers when I need it, and then I get to go back and do what I do, which is run my business, we think that's going to be reasonably attractive.
Meyer Shields: Okay, No, that makes a lot of sense, thanks. Second small question, was there any timing from maybe first quarter of 2020 capital markets issues that contributed to the reinsurance segment organic growth in 4Q?
Greg Case: Go ahead Eric.
Eric Andersen: No, there was not. I am sorry, the Q4 number was really driven by some cap bonds that actually were just expiring and we're renewing, so it was not necessarily new issuers or new buyers, but it was just traditional expiring that had to be replaced. But there was a significant amount of facultative business that essentially matches the timing by which the risk is placed either in the primary market or renewal of a fact placement. So there was no timing back and forth.
Greg Case: And really Meyer, the issue or the question on reinsurance we would suggest is an annual question, it is a 2019 question, it's not the 17% in the quarter, which by the way, good, team did a great job on a smaller quarter. When you think about the 10% over the course of the year, and the root cause of that driven by - so much of that driven by net new as I described before, treaty alone explained over 60% of the difference. And I also explained, a lot of the differences are described before as did fact. And so, it really is the 10% organic for the year, which is really a powerful story. You know, and the retail market was driving more opportunities and our reinsurance colleagues were picking those up. So, all of these things are sort of happening. But to deliver 10% organic for the year was really remarkable effort by our reinsurance colleagues.
Meyer Shields: 100%. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: I just want to say thank you to everyone for joining us, and we look forward to the next quarter. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may disconnect now.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-25 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc’s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer of today's call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements as that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2019 results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc. Please go ahead.
Greg Case: Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. In addition, we have our two Co-Presidents, Eric Andersen and Mike O'Connor, joining the discussion to help lead our Q&A session with their frontline perspective of client impact that illustrates the results we’re achieving with clients through our Aon United growth strategy. Like previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website, so we can focus our time on these quarterly calls to provide you more insight into longer term view for the firm. First, let me start by recognizing the remarkable dedication of my Aon colleagues around the world. Their collective efforts continue to strengthen the firm and create long-term momentum, reflected through strong performance in the third quarter. We delivered positive results across each of our key financial metrics, including 5% organic revenue growth, and I’d highlight, organic revenue growth on the year-to-date and trailing 12 months basis of 6%, reflecting continued acceleration of our historical trend, substantial operating margin expansion of 350 basis points, and 11% EPS growth, overcoming FX headwinds in the quarter. We're driving a continued progress this year with momentum headed into last quarter of 2019. And this is a direct reflection of the strategic investments and actions we continue to take to achieve our potential operating as one united global professional services firm. Last quarter, we touched on valuable insights from our global risk management survey, highlighted how clients face growing volatility and complexity in today’s evolving world. Nearly every organization, industry and economy are confronting greater challenges than ever before. And most of these risks are underserved, if addressed at all, because they’re not well understood with less historical experience and use of available data to predict, measure or manage these challenges. More concerning is that these challenges are very likely to grow in intensity over the next few years as emerging risks become even more prominent, threatening the ability of our clients to continue driving growth, protecting their assets and developing talent. Against that backdrop, we are responding with actions to bring the full force of our firm to clients by developing innovative solutions and applying data and analytics to better inform and advise them for their future. This approach is at the core of our Aon United growth strategy and establishes the commercial foundation upon which we drive innovation, deliver expanded client value and accelerate the growth of our firm. Beginning in 2017, with the divestiture of our outsourcing business, we have taken a series of important steps, designed to remix our portfolio, to achieve a faster growing higher margin set of offerings that better reflect the expanding needs of our clients. This approach is best evidenced by the $4.8 billion disposition of our outsourcing business and a subsequent $1.5 billion reinvestment over the last two years, and middle market and back office service innovation. That reinvestment included the creation of Aon Business Services, an important step toward modernizing infrastructure and creating a common technology platform that simplifies repeatable elements of client service and allows colleagues to spend more time on the highest value aspects of their client relationships, while supporting sustainable margin expansion for the firm. In parallel, we took steps to reduce structural barriers that prevented colleagues from delivering the best of the firm to clients, which in 2018 included a shift to a single global brand and a creation of a single global operating committee, creating a forum for Aon United decision decision-making that has accelerated growth in our core business. Last year, we also created the New Ventures Group, which is driven by a team of global leaders that command the capital and supporting infrastructure necessary to function as a growth stage development platform. This group is developing a portfolio of cutting edge client solutions on topics like intellectual property and public sector partnerships, which further accelerate net new innovation on behalf of clients and expands our addressable market. The Aon United actions we have taken at the global level have unified our firm and further strengthened our capabilities, which is proven out by our performance through 2019. With this momentum, we announced the next phase of our Aon United growth strategy earlier this month, outlining two key components that translate our progress at the global level and how we go to market locally, allowing us to more effectively bring the full force of our global firm to clients. We describe the first component as delivering Aon United because it includes a series of steps that will improve sales effectiveness, strengthen our segmentation strategy and further increase collaboration across solution lines, all of which means more value creation for clients and further acceleration of organic growth. The second component is about the expansion of our industry-leading Aon Business Services platform. Aon Business Services has already proven that it helps capitalize on the benefits of our global scale to deliver world-class client service and provide colleagues additional capacity to deliver more value to clients, which is why we’re expanding our Aon Business Services footprint and establishing client service hubs, leveraging technology platforms and new capabilities to accelerate our ability to deliver the best of the firm to clients while driving further operational excellence in our back and middle office services, which will drive greater productivity in our operations and contribute to sustainable margin expansion. These moves create a common baseline for Aon United and the experience of Aon United in our local geographies, including how the firm articulates our value proposition to clients, delivers repeatable elements of client service, develops our colleagues, and measures return on invested capital. At the end of the day, all these steps come back to how we can most effectively bring the best of our firm to clients so that we can help them improve their operational performance, reduce volatility or strengthen their capital position, which is why will continue to take steps to connect our firm, leverage our global scale and strategically invest in industry-defining content to amplify the value we can provide on their behalf and increase our relevance in today's evolving landscape. For your reference, I'd like to highlight one example of how our colleagues came together with the real business partner approach to address the clients’ unique need, to give you an idea of how our Aon United efforts translate into value at the frontline. A global agricultural firm was facing operational losses due to cash flow volatility throughout the year, based on seasonal crop yield. That could be impacted at any given time by weather-related events or other variables outside their control. We believed we could help this client with insight gained through data and analytics that would guide a strategic choice. Our team brought together commercial risk, reinsurance and data analytics capabilities. Then, we analyzed satellite-gathered weather data, applied our proprietary catastrophic impact forecasting model, and overlaid trends with the client’s revenue. Our team was able to correlate patterns that enabled the design of a parametric trigger solution unique to this client’s operational risk. The result was an innovative tailor-made crop risk management program that pays off automatically once a predetermined trigger is reached. This is a more efficient and timely approach, supporting our clients’ competitive advantage in maintaining their prices regardless of harvest quality. They also benefit from cash flow reliability, operational and capital stability, and improved long-term business planning. And that's just one recent success story of how we're responding to unique client demand with action, truly made possible by greater colleague collaboration and through commercializing our proprietary content and data into an opportunity to deliver client value. But, the application is happening across the portfolio as we scale our Aon United efforts, translating into improved growth profile for the firm as we drive new business generation and create greater retention and share of existing clients. Our trend of organic growth has already improved from 3% in 2014 and 2015 to 4% in 2016 and 2017 to 5% in 2018, and now in 2019, we delivered 6% year-to-date. Further, we expect strong performance in the fourth quarter, resulting in continued progress for the full year against our goal of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth or greater over the long-term. In summary, our clients are demanding that they be better informed and better advised to navigate and address the complex and evolving challenges they face. We continue to build momentum as we strengthen our ability to create value on behalf of clients through investments in industry-defining content and capability combined with greater alignment across our firm, while also achieving strong financial results and increased value to our shareholders. With that overview, I’d like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial progress year-to-date and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we continue to take steps to deliver Aon United, which is amplifying our ability to serve clients distinctively and deliver improved financial performance. We delivered positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first nine months of the year, strong organic revenue growth and increased operating leverage have contributed to substantial operational improvement, which is translating into double-digit free cash flow growth. We’re delivering on restructuring initiatives and funding significant investments across the firm that will deliver improved financial performance long-term. As I further reflect on our performance year-to-date, first the growth portfolio of our firm is improving with 6% organic revenue growth year-to-date and for the trailing 12 months. I would highlight year-to-date organic revenue growth accelerated 200 basis points from 4% in 2018 to 6% in 2019 as we deliver on our goal of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth over the long-term. Reported revenue has been pressured throughout 2019 by an unfavorable impact from changes in FX. Our disciplined focus on maximizing return on invested capital continues to help shape the portfolio towards our highest growth and return opportunities as highlighted by the divestiture of certain businesses in retirement solutions at the end of the second quarter. Second, we continued another quarter of substantial operational improvements, which has contributed to strong year-to-date performance of 12% operating income growth, and operating margin expansion of 250 basis points. Both operating income growth and operating margin expansion have improved on a nine-month basis compared to results six months, while the impact from restructuring savings has remain similar, reflecting increased operating leveraging across our portfolio. We are translating strong operational performance into double-digit EPS growth of 10% year-to-date, overcoming continued headwinds from FX translation. FX rates continued to have an unfavorable impact on results in the third quarter due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar, resulting in a significant net unfavorable impact of approximately $0.20 year-to-date or a $58 million impact on operating income. If currency to remain stable at today’s rates, we anticipate an unfavorable impact of $0.04 or approximately $12 million reduction of operating income in the fourth quarter. We continue to successfully execute against our restructuring initiatives with $32 million incremental savings in the third quarter. Our ongoing restructuring initiatives are driving expense savings near-term, but more importantly they are enabling growth of the firm as we unlock additional operating leverage through our Aon Business Services operating model. Aon Business Services is helping us modernize our infrastructure and create common technology platform. When we simply and standardize repeatable elements of back and middle office processes, we’re finding that our colleagues have more time to spend with clients, strengthening our relationships and identifying expanded opportunities to offer. Looking beyond near-term restructuring savings, we expect to drive sustainable operating performance and long-term core margin expansion annually, similar to the 70 to 80 basis points of operating margin improvement achieved annually over the last decade, net of continued reinvestment and growth opportunities. This is driven by organic growth, portfolio mix shift and ongoing productivity improvements. Lastly, free cash flow increased by $200 million or 25% to $996 million. Substantial growth through the first nine months primarily reflects strong operational performance. I would note, both the prior and current periods include impacts that largely offset each other in total for a neutral impact to year-over-year growth. As we think about cash flow generation going forward, we’re focused on maximizing the translation of accelerating revenue growth into the highest level of free cash flow in three ways. Operating income growth continued progress on working capital initiatives and structural uses of cash winding down. 2018 was a peak year for cash usage as shown in our presentation on slide 26. Declining uses of cash restructuring, CapEx and pension continue -- are expected to free up over $595 million of free cash flow by the end of 2020. We continue to have significant upside to a base of more than $1.45 billion of free cash flow in 2018, prior to any operating income growth over working capital improvements. Together, these inputs give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of double-digit growth in free cash flow over the long term. Further, we have the opportunities of incremental debt while maintaining current investment-grade rating as EBITDA growth, restructuring costs wind down and pension liability improve, providing significant financial flexibility over the next few years to further invest in value-creation, return of capital to shareholders. We're diligent about maximizing return on capital and make capital allocation decisions through this discipline. Share repurchase remains the highest return on capital investment today, given our free cash flow valuation and outlook, highlighted by the $1.5 billion of share repurchase year-to-date. In summary, strong top and bottom-line performance for both the quarter and year-to-date continue to reinforce our Aon United initiative of strategic decision, building momentum as we enter the last quarter of the year, but more importantly, strengthen the long-term growth profile for ourselves. In addition, our disciplined approach to return on capital, combined with our expected significant free cash flow growth and increased debt opportunity over the next few years provides financial flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long-term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'd be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have nine questions in queue for Q&A. Our first question comes from David Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Greg Case: David, are you there? Operator, why don't we go to the next question and we will pick David up later.
Operator: Okay. One moment please. Sorry. [Operator Instructions] Sorry for that. That is Mike Zaremski, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Mike Zaremski: Well, great. Thanks, good morning.
Greg Case: Hey, Mike.
Mike Zaremski: First question is on the commercial insurance pricing environment. A number of large corporations have been talking about fairly significant increases in pricing and/or changes in capacities, kind of starting in April, May and persisting into 4Q. Maybe you can comment on what you guys are seeing, and if it’s helping drive revenues and margins for Aon?
Greg Case: Yes. Mike, from our standpoint, we talk about this on the call frequently. So, I really appreciate the question. Again, for us, remember, pricing really translates into market impact. So, that’s encompassing both rate and insured values. And as we’ve highlighted, market impact for us, I would say, it had a modestly positive impact to our results. Just maybe three observations. When you think about Aon overall, something around half of our world operates completely independent of any insurance pricing cycle. And even within our risk business, a third of it as fee based. And when you think about our overall approach and what we do, our world is really centered around using data and analytics capability to really help clients at an individual level, focus on their circumstances and we get the best results. You will see us modify programs, individual covers based on market conditions. They will fundamentally -- we will help them change behavior, based on market reaction, our market position. So for us, overall, modestly positive impact to results, and our view is that highly client centric approach is one of the reasons we’ve got new business generation and retention levels at an all-time high.
Mike Zaremski: And a follow-up to that is for the one-third that’s fee-based, historically that’s grown at a low single-digit pace or how should investors think about how the fee-based business revenues -- sensitivity?
Greg Case: So, Mike, we don’t break out literally sort of growth at that level. Our view, as we come back, there is really not a difference. This is about how we add value to clients and consistent with what as we described by Aon United behavior. This is how we bring global capability to our clients in our backyard, and when we do it, how we describe the value. So literally, the work we’re doing includes how we describe the value to clients. If we create value, we should get paid for the value; and if we don’t, we should highlight that as well. So, we’re incredibly transparent. And our view is, we are increasing our capability to both deliver value, articulate value and get paid for value.
Mike Zaremski: Okay, great. And lastly, probably for Christa. Interest rates have declined fairly measurably year-to-date and stock market in the U.S. has done well. Any early views on if things don’t change much from here, will the pension, expenses or free cash flows be materially impacted for next year?
Christa Davies: Yes. I mean, it’s a great question. Mike, what I would say is, as we think about our pension on fund liability, we do an annual measurement at 12/31 each year. The balance sheet in terms of our fund of pension liability, Q3 doesn’t reflect changes in interest rate or asset valuation. And we’ve certainly done a lot of work on our pensions over the last 10 years to free the plans and close them and derisk them to massively reduce volatility. So, our result in pension cash contributions in 2020, you can see a show in the chart on page 26, it shows decreasing substantially and we feel really good about that outlook. In term of other impacts and interest rate, our debt is fixed, and so, we don’t see material impact from interest rate.
Mike Zaremski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
David Styblo: Hi, there. Can you guys hear me this time?
Greg Case: We can. David, welcome back. What’s on your mind?
David Styblo: I guess, maybe I give Mike and Eric a chance to chime in on this. But, I’m curious as you guys are going to market with your clients and it sounds like you’re increasingly doing more customized solutions to help them with their specific set of risks. I’d imagine that probably takes more efforts, human capital resources and so forth. I’m wondering, to what extent or how do you get compensated for that? Does that wind up being a higher margin sell for you guys ultimately because you are providing a customized solution set for that client, if they could maybe not otherwise find at the market? Maybe just what does that look like going through the sales cycle?
Greg Case: Yes. When you step back, David and think about sort of what really happens when we bring the best of our firm. In essence, we got -- the beauty of this is, we have the capability, we have the capacity, our colleagues have the expertise, and our clients have increasing need. The question is how do you connect the dots and actually make that happen. And so, we have more and more account situations where we're spending time with the client understanding broad-based needs. Our colleagues have greater awareness of Aon and what they're trying to get accomplished and what we're trying to get accomplished. And so, they actually bring these other colleagues in. They address these issues in ways we haven't addressed before. And the beauty of this is, it not only creates net new areas, but it also very much sort of addresses retention on existing business, and what we're doing from an existing client standpoint. So, the approach we're taking very much sort of leverages assets and capabilities that we've got, and clients respond very, very positively to it.
Mike O'Connor: David, it’s Mike. Maybe I'd give you an example of how we help decrease the perception of volatility from climate change that was impacting our client’s real estate portfolio. So, really, really, I find very interesting example of how we're growing and expanding relationships with clients. So, in this situation, a large real estate client who is an investor, and the team is doing a terrific job around commercial risk, but the team in this case just stepped back and said, what is the real issue challenging this client’s business. And one of the issues they were facing was an overhang of how climate change and other catastrophic risks over a long-term would impact the real estate portfolio. And our team would have done this in the past. They brought together colleagues from around the world. They brought together colleagues from commercial risk, reinsurance, our data and analytics team and said, could we actually come together with the experiences, the capabilities we have in the data analytics, and could we actually put together risk portfolio diagnostic to basically identify and quantify the impact that climate change and other risks would have on this portfolio of real estate over the long term. We were able to share that insight with the client. They were able to take it back to their investors and actually show facts and scenarios and thereby reduce the perception of risk. And for us, this is a whole new relationship with the client. It grew our relationship with them and also solidified us as a real partner to help their business for the long term. That's just an example for us that we get really excited about in terms of what we can do for clients.
Eric Andersen: And Mike, maybe -- Dave, it’s Eric. Maybe I'd just pick up on another one, because you asked about how we bring the teams together. And we use an integrated client planning process. So, maybe I'll just use another example to run through. We had a financial institution client that had been a long-term client, but during that process, uncovered that they were dissatisfied with the product that they were selling through their own distribution agents and were looking to find ways to either revamp either the pricing, the underwriting, the distribution, the claims process, the whole sort of process of offering the product. And they asked us for our thoughts. And we were able to bring our insurance consulting capability, our data and analytics, as well as our experience and knowledge of the marketplace. They'd also asked some other advisory firms for their opinion. But, our ability to tie all of it together sort of enabled us to proceed with the client. And ultimately for the client, the outcome is pretty straightforward, right? They end up with a revamped process that drives more revenue for them, reduces the volatility of the product itself. But, for us, it actually gives us a much deeper insight into the client. It was already a great client. So, really, it was bringing a new capability into an existing market, as opposed to going out to cyber or government de-risking or others we talked about. This is about expanding capabilities within an existing relationship, using that integrated client planning process that I referred to earlier.
Greg Case: And David, one real important point here too, this is -- your question about the sales cycle, this doesn’t elongate the sales cycle at all. In fact, it’s very different than that. We're bringing existing capability and matching it to client need. We’re -- in fact, we’re creating new sales cycles. So, it’s the same sales cycle under traditional products, our traditional areas, and then new sales cycles that we serve another clients but not that client. So, the example, Eric described sort of was literally an expansion. So, the sales cycle and what we expand in into was no longer than ever before. And it just creates frankly tremendous efforts, even if a client says in the end, I don’t really think we need you on it, we’ve engaged in a conversation, which changes their perception of who we are and how we think about them. That actually impacts retention in our core -- and what we’re currently doing them in addition to sort of open up new business and new opportunities.
David Styblo: Got it. Thanks for the color on that. Two quick questions for Christa. Heard your FX comments about the fourth quarter. I’m wondering can you provide us some perspective to help out with modeling for how the FX looks to impact the P&L in 2020. And then, free cash flow, obviously rebounded really nicely, up 25% year-to-date. Was there anything unusual in the third quarter that helps provide maybe a onetime benefit or pull forward? And then, looking to the fourth quarter, you expect free cash flow to be up year-over-year. Are there any other factors there, timing or what not that might cause it to decline?
Christa Davies: Great. Okay. So, on FX, I guess, what I would say is, we did give guidance for Q4 that it’s minus $0.04. It’s really due to a stronger U.S. dollar. In general, we prefer a weaker U.S. dollar across our global portfolio because we’re translating local revenue and local expenses into U.S. dollars. And so, if the stronger U.S. dollar continues, we would expect some FX headwind in 2020 but what we haven’t given guidance.  And then, on your FX -- on your free cash flow question, sorry. So, free cash flow, it’s very strong year-to-date, 25% up year-to-date over last year. We have given guidance on free cash flow. We expect double digits for the foreseeable future. And so, we would expect very strong free cash flow growth for the full year 2019. There were some restructuring cash charges that timed out of Q3 into Q4. If you think about the whole program we’ll finish, restructuring in 2019 and so you’ll see those cash charges come through in the fourth quarter. But, we’re really excited about free cash flow for the full year 2019 and most excited about free cash flow for 2020 in terms of double-digit free cash flow growth plus the declining needs of cash.
Operator: Thank you very much. And our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you. Good morning. My first question, earlier this week you guys announced a regional insurer group initiative. Just trying to get a little bit of additional color there, just in terms of how you would kind of size your business in that regional kind of space today and kind of long-term growth aspirations there, and if that is expanding that type of regional size account offering dependent upon any M&A activity within the U.S.?
Greg Case: Elyse, that’s just another example as we look across sort of the global portfolio and it’s back to kind of as we connect to the dots on opportunities. We saw this as a great opportunity to help a sector that we know very, very well. And it really isn’t about the size; it’s really about what we can bring to the table. So, if you think about walking into this client and helping them with their -- a lot of the things on protecting their balance sheet, which we know very, very well, think about how we can help them on retirement, on health, on the broader base set of things to candidly help them improve their operating performance, strengthen the balance sheet, reduce volatility, and we bring all Aon to bear on that mission. We just love that approach in that sector. And frankly, we’ve seen it happen around the world. This is another example of -- we've seen the movie before, how do we translate what we’ve seen sort of in the client impact in an effective way. And this is just another example of that. We're very excited about it. Our leaders are rallied around the world to do it. And it really is a set of leaders across solution lines who are going to sort of bring the full force of Aon to this structure and we're really excited about it.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then, my second question just in terms of margin, so, 350 basis points this quarter. You still get around 210 or so, if we assume -- kind of adjust for the savings in the quarter. I guess, what I'm trying to get a sense of is what's kind of the sustainable level of margin improvement here. And I know you guys kind of continuously pointed at 70 to 80 that you’ve historically seen. But, it seems that what you're doing with Aon Business Services, should lead to greater operating leverage. So, should we think about the third quarter level being more sustainable relative to the margin improvement you’ve seen in the past?
Christa Davies: It's a great question, Elyse. And what we would say is, year-to-date margin expansion is 250 basis points, of which 110 basis points is core margin expansion, if you take out the restructuring savings. You're absolutely right that Aon Business Services is proving up with incremental operating leverage. It's driving sustained profitability improvements well beyond the restructuring savings into 2020 and beyond. One simple example of that is the fact that we’ve actually automated over 500,000 hours this year through automation, which drives ongoing productivity. So, you can kind of see the improved operating leverage before we reinvest in additional growth opportunities. We do think that the right guidance going forward in terms of margin expansion is 70 to 80 basis points. That is in line with our 10-year historical average. So, we feel really good about that.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then, my last question, in terms of reinsurance, growth is still pretty good, but we did see a little bit of slowdown sequentially. Was there anything in terms of maybe the new business flow? I guess, did you see any kind of change in trends within your reinsurance from the second to the third quarter in either new business or retention that might have impacted the sequential slowdown in organic?
Eric Andersen: Hi, Elyse. It's Eric. Maybe I'll take stab at it. The reality is, no, we have not seen a slowdown on it. The composition of the book is different in the second half of the year. The first half is pretty heavily loaded towards the treaty business. The second half is much more facultative and capital markets. And that business is a little bit lumpy, based on how and when the clients need the cover. And so, I would say, we are continuing to be pretty strong in that space. It's a double-digit growth business for us, especially the pack business, and we continue to see that going forward.
Greg Case: And like everything, Elyse, we look at these things year-over-year when you think about year-to-date progress against year-to-date last year, continued momentum and build in the business, absolutely fantastic, 9% year-to-date. So, continued progress and momentum.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Paul Newsome: The only thing I had was, I was wondering about the divestitures that you’ve been doing. How we should think about the impact on revenue and margins prospectively in fourth quarter and maybe 2020 from the divestiture piece that you've given?
Christa Davies: Yes. It's a great question, Paul. And what I would say is, as we think about managing the portfolio, we’re doing it on a return on capital basis, and maximizing our investment in high revenue growth, high margin businesses, and then obviously divesting lower revenue growth, lower margin businesses. As we think about modeling going forward, you should see a similar impact in retirement due to divestiture of that business in Q2 for the next three quarters, so that will sort of flow through over the course of the year, similar to what you saw in retirement this quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heagerty, Atlantic Equities. Your line is now open.
John Heagerty: Thanks. Couple of questions if I could. Firstly, on the data and analytics division, it looks a little bit like the revenue -- the organic revenue growth is decelerating over the past four quarters. So, I was wondering if we should read it like that or whether it's just that it has much more of a skew towards Q4 and that started to come through again this year?
Greg Case: Yes. I’d step back, John. As you think about sort of growth overall, it just is a lesson for all the solution lines really. It really isn't about any single quarter or even in solution line, we really look at growth across the board. So, we're really looking at sort of Aon results overall and perspective how that progresses year-to-year. So, the lots of things happen within individual solutions lines. And if you sort of look at that perspective, that bucket together, you see really tremendous progress, 5% in 2018, 6% year-to-date in 2019. By the way that's versus 4% in year-to-date in 2018, so up 200 basis points. And really across the portfolio, all solution lines, including data and analytics are sort of up year-to-date, including data and analytics, I may say, when you think about year-to-date. So, for us, we wouldn't focus on any one or particular quarter or the other, it really is about year-to-date progress or year-over-year progress. And we feel very good about where we are against that.
John Heagerty: And then, just on the divested revenues, following up on Paul's question. Just it looks like the amount in terms of revenue divested so far this year is just under $100 million. In terms of cash flow generated from the divestments, it looks like it's only about $43 million. So, what do we -- can you give a bit more detail on what those business were and what sort of margin they we're generating?
Christa Davies: Yes. I mean, what we can say, John, is that they’re lower revenue growth, lower margin businesses. So, it fits with our focus on improving growth and improving margins and focus on return on capital. We haven't given specifics on the amount of cash we received. We feel really good about the overall management of the portfolio, including those divestments.
Greg Case: Just bear in mind, as you think about sort of where we are, this is probably one that's not even year-over-year, really is over multiple years, as you think about where we are and think about our acquisition and divestiture strategy over the last number of years, we are absolutely maniacally focused on improving return on invested capital. So, it's not surprising, the cash flow characteristics of the business we divest aren't nearly as good as the ones we have, nor the ones we buy. And so we're going to be lumpy year-over-year as we think about the right acquisitions. We're going to bring in content and capability we can scale, and that will drive top-line growth over time. But, it really in this case is even more over a period of years it will drive top line growth as you've seen over the last decade. So, hopefully that's helpful. We'll continue to think about the divestitures, when they are helpful to the ROIC and the overall portfolio; and we'll continue to make acquisitions with great capacity to do so when they make sense as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning. First question, just following up on Elyse's margin question. So, just over 200 basis points of core margin improvement in the quarter, 100 or so basis points of improvement year-to-date, is the above run rate improvement also a function of timing and magnitude of investments in the platform?
Christa Davies: It's really about the operating leverage we’re getting through Aon Business Services, which is accelerating our overall margin expansion year-to-date. Because if you look at the nine-month operating margin expansion versus the six months, we've accelerated, and the restructuring savings has remained about the same proportion of that and the core margin expansion has expanded. And so, we are getting real operating leverage in the platform from growth, yes, from leverage in ABS. And we expect that to continue through calendar year 2019 and into 2020. One of the other things I'd say is operating leverage is allowing us to fund greater investment in some whole new markets and capacity. Greg, you might want to talk a bit about that.
Greg Case: Christa described very, very well. This is -- as you think about our margin -- expanding margin, our capability to do so. You've seen us over a 10-year period due to the 70 basis points to 80 basis points that’s been described already, you ask yourself the question, what's the probability we can continue to do that. We would suggest that this quarter and this year to-date’s performance says that probability is going up, not going down. And that's because of the operational leverage Christa described. In addition to that, it's really important for us to convey how much we are investing in future growth for our business. And this is a number of areas. If you think about what we've done in intellectual property, what we've done in the entire area of kind of public partnerships, what we've done in small client, what we've done in retirement business, in the health business, all these things are sort of net new things we've never done before. You've seen examples we talked about the World Bank CAP on last time. There is a whole series of things we've done to create net new, truly not just expanding share on what's already out there, but net new, things that have never been looked at before, same in cyber. So, there is a level of investment that is quite high. We're very excited about in terms of future long-term growth, but we're also very committed and making sure we can continue to improve margins year-over-year. And as Christa described, Aon Business Services is a way to do that, but it also has lots of different attributes in terms of what we're doing. The muscle is really, really powerful and we're going to keep working on it.
Mike O’Connor: Greg, maybe I'd share -- it's Mike. Maybe I'd share an example of how Aon Business Services is changing what we do. And I'd use our health care center of excellence that’s delivering better outcomes, as well as getting efficiency and productivity gains. And the short description of this is, we've basically moved our 600 actuaries into a center of excellence model. We're leveraging best practices, we're bringing common tools to bear, and we're driving productivity gains. And we mentioned in the past, we have built an analytical suite of tools and architect, and this group of actuaries is using that as well. We talked about how our colleagues in the field are using, our actuaries are using as well, where we're going from manual calculations using assumptions to AI-driven suite of tools where we can do hundreds of assumptions simultaneously and generate a 0.5 million scenarios for our client, so, we can actually work with the client to pick the best outcome. In addition, you bring the group together in center of excellence and we've improved peer reviews through automated workflows. So, we get all the productivity gains that you'd expect in a center of excellence. We're most excited about the impact we're having with clients.
Greg Case: I really appreciate that example, Mike. So, again, Yaron, the reason we entered it, sort of here, this is here -- you take a step back to your question, fundamentally, our ability to improve margin, the reason we're so excited about Aon Business Services is it creates operating leverage in the business that's meaningful and real. But, no kidding, Mike said 600 actuaries. We had them all around the firm. We are now bringing them together. They are doing things we didn't -- hadn't done before. And instead of giving the client three or four options on the health side, we're giving them a continuum of 500 sort of iterations -- 500,000, I'm sorry, I am being corrected by my colleagues, 500,000 iterations of what we can do, all better than three by the way, and it changes fundamentally our ability to serve clients. So, it builds operating leverage and improves service. And that's the equation we're pulling together when we describe Aon United. That's one big aspect of it.
Yaron Kinar: That's very helpful. I appreciate that. My second question is around intellectual property. So, Greg, you've talked in the past, even just mentioned it now that there is an underserved potential for -- or underserved client needs that that have created a significant potential for the market. Can you and the team maybe help us try and size this market opportunity and IP? And, then also discuss the specific actions, particularly year-to-date that Aon has taken to position itself to capitalize on this opportunity.
Greg Case: You start with literally the fundamental opportunity the potential demand. And it's -- anyway you look at it, it’s incredibly compelling. Just step back, take the estimate, 2018, [ph] how much of the value the S&P 500 was attributable to intangible assets, and it's 80% to 85%. Think about what that means, 20 trillion plus. It’s amazingly huge number sort of attributable intangible assets. That was probably in the low 20s in the 70s, it's now 80s, mid-80s. And so you essentially say, if that's where the value is coming from this is back to the idea of net new. What are we doing that makes a difference for clients net new that doesn't exist and the protection of intellectual property is something we have never done before. And it's why again, we brought in a tremendous amount of capability, some with Stroz Friedberg and 601West, tremendous capability which we've added to over time. And we've got a 100 plus colleagues who are focused on how you think about value in intellectual property and how you provide cover on it, how you protect clients from liabilities that come with it or the IP theft. And so you ask yourself, how big could that market be. And this is a market that should be much bigger than cyber. This is $100 billion plus market over time. If we help clients understand how to address and protect intellectual property, trade secrets, all the things that come with that, our view is this is a tremendous opportunity for the industry, and candidly, a tremendous opportunity for our clients. And the other piece, and I'm sorry to get off on the IP, but I can't help it. One of things about IP that's so cool is, a lot of what we do is protecting the house. And as in cyber something bad happens, how do you protect, something happens in a plant or equipment or something happens in a portfolio on the retirement side, these are protecting downsides. Intellectual property is about creating upside. You can actually help clients create net new value that they already have but didn't really know it. When you can actually help a client value a portfolio, by the way the valuation comes from the fact that the insurance markets actually back it. So, that creates the implicit value, all of a sudden you're creating opportunity. So, we're pretty bullish on this, as you can tell. And really in terms of sort of the idea of net new high-margin, high-margin because it's high value to clients. We're providing this kind of value to clients. We're doing things that no one else has been able to do. And the opportunity we think is substantial, and you will see us investing heavily behind it. Back to the question around maintaining 70 basis points, 80 basis points improvement and investing this heavily, how do you do it? Again, the 100-plus colleagues, how do you do it? You do it within Aon Business Services and other means to sort of create operating leverage in the business. And that's the equation we've got.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you for the comprehensive answers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is now open.
Meyer Shields: Greg, I was hoping you could walk us through the opportunities and challenges of Lloyd's Blueprint One on I guess, revenues and margins there?
Greg Case: Yes. Listen, we spend a lot of time with our partner in Lloyd’s John Neal, and Bruce and team, trying to offer thoughts and views and perspectives. We are absolutely focused on and delighted to be supportive whenever we can because it's important to our clients. And our guidance has largely been around sort of the following types of things. Whatever blueprint comes out to be, whatever incarnation comes out to be, you ask yourself the question, has it helped our clients? How has it done things for our clients that they don't get elsewhere in the world? Is there more innovation in a way that sort of benefits our clients? So, for us, it's all about that. And that's the test of relevance for all of us, and it's a test relevance for Lloyd's as well. And so, everything we've done around it is sort of how do we help them, see what has to be true for -- add value in a distinctive way. And then, we come back to, if you're adding value in a distinctive way that has real beneficial aspects for margin. If you are adding value in a way that's much more commoditized, then it's -- it should have much less attractive margin characteristics. So, for us, we don't -- this isn't about us, it's really about our clients and sort of how we can help Lloyd’s understand sort of what has to be true to help our clients. And we're very hopeful, John and Bruce and team have worked very hard to sort of -- to take some steps to sort of really drive this market forward. And we're excited about the possibilities and want to support in any way we can to support our clients.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. Is there any validity to the idea that this could be sort of a revenue headwind but improve the bottom line by even more?
Greg Case: No, I don't think that really -- at the end of the day, we haven't really thought about it in that way at all really. This is -- Lloyd's is a source of capital and capability for our clients. We want to apply it anywhere we can. John and Bruce are very well aware. There are other options out there as well, and we have access to all of them. So, we’re in essence essentially saying we still always come back Meyer to the question is what's the client need and how are we supporting and serving it. If we do that distinctively, our margins and growth take care of themselves, and we love that nice edge, by the way. That means we have to continue to improve. And if we don't, we suffer the consequences as does everyone else. Our view is, the opportunity is great. There is lots of capital choices out there to support our clients to the extent that's helpful and necessary. And that's how we're going to pursue it. So, we don't really see -- we're really not sort of seeing sort of any short-term, long-term sort of implications that would be we driven by the Lloyd's Blueprint.
Meyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. Another one small question for Christa. The press release notes that geographic distribution of earnings impacted the tax rate. Does FX itself have a tax rate impact?
Christa Davies: No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't, Meyer.
Meyer Shields: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Your line is now open.
Brian Meredith: Yes. Thanks. Most have been answered, but just want to hear -- Greg, I noticed in your survey, the number one challenge that I think corporations talk about is economic slowdowns/slow recovery. Could you give us some insight as to kind of what you're seeing right now? And also, is that at all a concern for you guys as far as your organic revenue growth going forward here if we do get some economic slowdown?
Greg Case: Yes. Brian, I would say, I appreciate you're referencing the risk survey. We find a lot of insight into that as we’re asking clients around the world what's most important to you, what's on your mind. Most -- sailing of which is, when you look at sort of the top 10 risks, most of them are -- don't actually have an insurance related answer, actually five have none, a few have partial and then a few have something. So, our view is that’s massive opportunity to sort of help clients. And to the extent slowdown becomes number one, how do we help clients do that. By the way, Eric and Mike both gave examples that would sort of lean into the headwinds of what would be a recession. As it relates to Aon, listen, we -- let's say, we feel fairly fortunate. If you think about sort of what's happened to us, if you go back to the recession of ‘08 and ‘09 and what happened in essence, you know the story well. We were largely flat in terms of sort of where that was. What you've seen us do in the first nine months of this year as everyone has talked about sort of issues and concerns is, grow 6% year-to-date versus 4% last year. So, we're up 200 basis points versus -- year-to-date versus last year, incredibly positive. Remember, a lot of the revenue is non-discretionary. So, 85% is renewed business and retention rates 90% plus on average. And so, it's a very unique kind of demand characteristic. By the way, that demand characteristic is true in commercial risk, it's true in reinsurance, it's true in retirement, it's true in health, incredibly powerful in terms of where we are. And then, if you think about where we were in ‘08 and ‘09, which is basically flat to the world and improved margins at the same time during the last recession, we're a very, very different and stronger firm now than we were then. Now, you actually have all the things that we had back then plus all the net new. So, we didn't have IP, we didn't have cyber, we didn't have some of the health advancements that Mike’s talked about, some of the things we've done on the retirement side. So, it's a much stronger firm in which we're creating new addressable demand that didn't exist before. And in many respects, we hope creating markets in which Aon will benefit and certainly others will too, competitors, everyone will. We open up $100 billion IP market that will benefit everyone. Same on cyber. We all know cyber is anemic, it's small compared to what it should be on behalf of clients, huge opportunity against that. So, for us, we’re always going to be vigilant. But, we feel very good about our ability to support clients. And in many respects, the demand grows in times of volatility or in times of stress for them. And to the extent we help them improve performance or strengthen their balance sheet or reduce volatility, that in on itself is actually going to create an interesting play. And then, the final thing I would say is sort of in recession, there is a bit of a flight to quality in terms of sort of making sure you can deliver on behalf of clients, and we believe we’d benefit from that.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then, one other quick one, one’s been you’re looking at the survey responses, and one’s political risk. And I think you may have commented about this a couple of quarters ago, but just maybe remind us, if indeed we do see Medicare for all, what impact would that have on your health solutions business?
Greg Case: Well, as we described by the way, this is again, you kind of come back to fundamental, what we're talking about here on sort of the health world overall. This is an incredibly dysfunctional part of the global economy as we all know. And the population around the world is becoming less healthy and per unit cost of healthcare is going up. So, net-net, we think there is going to be massive demand in the context of this. Remember, if you look at half our health business is in the U.S., half outside the U.S., and that outside the U.S. is actually more akin to the single payer world. And we've done exceptionally well. We are growing faster and margins are going up. There is a lot of opportunity on just beyond the core but also on what you do from an elective standpoint on top of it. So, as we look at economies around the world, we would say the demand is real, our ability to address it is real, and we like we like that opportunity. The final thing I would say is, without any political commentary on whether that's a good solution or not, let’s assume you actually went to that solution, the transition to that solution would create huge turmoil with our clients. And our ability to sort of support them in the transition would also be a source of opportunity. But, net-net, long-term, we love that health space. I think there is tremendous opportunity to help clients in what is really stressful world. And one of the things you look about it, it's not just the health side, it's the health and retirement, because our clients’ employees are overspending on health on average and underspending on retirement. And imagine, Brian, if we could actually help them tweak that 1% or 2% for their employees, our companies would have done a huge service to the families of the employees who work for them. So, we're pretty bullish on sort of what's out there in the stresses for our clients and our ability to address it. 
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Josh Shanker: Good morning. Just a couple of numbers questions really. The first one -- and David Styblo kind of asked some questions about it. I'm wondering if you can talk to a little bit what the normalized free cash flow would have been in the first nine months of 2018 or maybe how you think about what is the normalized growth that you've enjoyed here in the first nine months of 2019 or maybe the first -- I know, you're talking about 2020, but maybe we talk about where normalized free cash flow growth has gone over the past 12 months?
Christa Davies: So, the way we think about it, Josh, is really our free cash flow growth for first nine months of the year is 25%. We are on track for a strong free cash flow growth for full-year 2019. We've given long-term guidance of double-digit free cash flow growth for the foreseeable future and we feel like we are on track for that. And we're particularly excited about 2020 where we will have underlying free cash flow growth of double-digit, plus a declining use of cash, as we see on page 26 of the materials, through decreased cash usage on pension, CapEx and restructuring.
Josh Shanker: But, you can't say normalizing for restructuring spend and whatnot, what the 2019 versus 2018 free cash flow trend has been?
Christa Davies: I mean, you can see the restructuring cash yourselves, but we're getting double-digit free cash flow growth.
Josh Shanker: Normalized, do you think that's normalized?
Christa Davies: Josh, I mean, what we would say is we feel like we have double-digit free cash flow growth year-to-date and long-term.
Josh Shanker: Okay. And the other question also numbers based. In the health care solutions sector, can you talk about the dollar value of non-recurring headwinds you had in the quarter on revenues and how much revenue has been moved from 3Q into 4Q?
Christa Davies: Here's what we'd say on health solutions. We feel really good about where we are in terms of health solutions. We delivered 5% growth year-to-date, it's accelerated from 4% growth year-to-date in 2018. And we have all lines contributing, all solution lines contributing to mid single-digit growth or greater for the full year 2019, and we're looking forward to a strong Q4.
Josh Shanker: But, there is no guidance around those two items you cited in the press release?
Christa Davies: No.
Josh Shanker: Okay. Thank you very much.
Christa Davies: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: I just want to say to everyone, thank you very much for joining. And we look forward to the conversation next quarter. Thanks so much.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc’s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today’s call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2019 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. In addition, we have our two Co-Presidents, Eric Andersen and Mike O’Connor, joining the discussion to help lead our Q&A session with their frontline perspective of client impact and Aon United at work. Like previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website, as we focus our time of these quarterly calls to provide you more insight into longer-term view for the firm. I’d like to start today by acknowledging the tremendous work of my Aon colleagues around the world. Their collective efforts continue to strengthen the firm and create long-term momentum, reflected through strong operational results in the second quarter, including 6% organic revenue growth; I would highlight this is the fourth consecutive quarter of achieving 6% organic revenue growth, reflecting continued acceleration of our historical trend; substantial operating margin expansion of 240 basis points; 13% operational income growth; and 9% EPS growth, overcoming further FX headwinds in the quarter. Our results reflect continued progress this year and are in direct reflection of the strategic actions we’ve progressively taken to drive Aon United and achieve our potential, operating as one united global professional services firm. As we’ve previously discussed, we’ve been laying the foundation for Aon United for over a decade, evolving our portfolio, investing in new content capability and breaking down internal barriers, all focused on increasing our relevance and strengthen our ability to serve clients. Helping the client improve operational performance, reduce volatility or strengthen their capital position is at the core of our mission. In today’s evolving world, nearly every organization, industry and economy are confronting greater challenges than ever before, while at the same time many organizations report that they are less prepared than ever before. This is what we’re hearing from CEOs and other business leaders across the globe. And it was validated in the global survey Aon conducts every two years. The latest report released in April was informed by the largest number of respondents to ever participate, reflecting insights from more than 2,600 clients across 33 industries, spanning small, medium and large organizations from 60 countries around the world. One critical insight is that organizations must be more prepared for a broad range of traditional risks, such as a slowing economy, damage to brand and volatile global trade conditions, as well as emerging risks such as cyber attacks, intellectual property and business interruption from non-physical risks that threaten their ability to continue driving growth, protecting their assets and developing talent. Further, a list of the top 15 ranked challenges within the survey reveals another insight. Most of these risks are underserved, if at all today, because they’re not well understood due to less historical experience and data available to predict, measure or manage these challenges. As a result, risk readiness has declined to its lowest levels in 12 years. Only 12% of those responded in the survey reported that they use risk modeling and a mere 24% said they could quantify their top 10 risks. The complexity of the situation our clients face today is substantial, perhaps more concerning that these challenges are very likely to grow in intensity over the next few years. New risks will become even more prominent, including the dynamics of an aging workforce, the impact of climate change, the growing prevalence of cyber-risks and the emergence of disruptive technologies. Reflecting on the implications for Aon, client demand is higher than ever before and clients are pushing us to find new ways to address their growing needs. As we said previously, we must innovate faster than our clients on all these topics to stay relevant and create value on their behalf. The steps we have taken around Aon Untied combined with significant investment and focus on content and capability all reinforce and amplify our ability to increase our relevance with clients. At Aon, we’re responding, we’re focused on brining the full force of our firm to our clients, by developing innovative solutions and applying data and analytics to better inform and prepare them for their future. I’d like to highlight one example that demonstrates how Aon United led to an innovative solution addressing a common challenge that organizations of all sizes continue to face. Managing their ever-increasing healthcare costs will not impact in their ability to attract and retain key talent. I’d also note that the failure to attract and retain top talent was ranked among the top 15 risks identified by the client survey. In response to broad client demand, our team came together with actuaries, data scientists, user design experts, software developers and subject matter experts across solution lines and in combination with the IT capability of Aon Business Services to deliver a data-driven cloud-based tool called Aon Architect. Aon Architect uses machine learning science to help clients design optimal health benefit packages that balance employer financial objectives and employee satisfaction. This innovative tool is a customizable interactive model that identifies the most cost effective and relevant combinations across thousands of different benefit program options based on an employer’s actual population demographics and Aon’s proprietary employee perception data. Aon Architect launched in 2018 has already been used with nearly 100 clients so far in 2019. That’s just one example of how we’re responding to broad client demand with innovation. We’ve also organized focused teams of leaders to dedicate more time to value creation for client-driven solutions that can be applied more broadly and faster with similar clients or industries. Our Enterprise Client Group was formed to lead Aon Untied efforts with targeted clients, by identifying superior tailor-made solutions that address their specific business objectives. And we established our New Ventures Group to accelerate industry-leading innovation, scale our capabilities with greater speed to market and expand our relevance with clients. Last quarter, we announced that the New Ventures Group would formally sponsor our Intellectual Property Solutions business. This quarter, the group announced the formation of a public sector partnership which will enhance our position to serve governments and leading social sector organizations as clients. Obviously, these institutions play a very significant and active role in the global economy. Building innovation at scale to support the mission of these groups at the national, regional and local levels represents a significant long-term growth opportunity. For example, we’re investing in capabilities to help governments more effectively manage natural disaster risk, deliver housing stability and create more resilient public balance sheets. In addition, the work we recently completed for the World Bank is a powerful illustration of potential impact. Bringing together Chile, Mexico, Peru and Colombia, we placed the largest ever sovereign risk transaction in the history of the insurance market using parametric triggers to protect against earthquake risk. Our Aon United efforts put in place over the last decade are translating into accelerated revenue growth, as you can see from the upward trend of 3% organic growth in 2014 and 2015; 4% in 2016 and 2017; 5% in 2018; and now 6% year-to-date in 2019 as well as 6% for the trailing 12 months period. We are confident that these actions were continued to be a driving factor, reinforcing our goal of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth or greater over the long-term. In summary, our clients are demanding, better insight, advice and solutions to navigate and address the complex and evolving challenges they face. We continue to strengthen our ability to create value on behalf of clients through investments and not just industry-leading, but many examples, industry-defining content and capability, while also achieving the strong financial results and increased value to our shareholders. With that overview, I’d like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our progress in the first half of the year and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, the steps we’re taking to drive Aon United in response to increasing client demand combined with significant investment in content and capability, is amplifying our ability to serve clients and our ability to deliver improved operational and financial performance. We delivered continued progress to both the quarter and year-to-date. For the first half of the year, we’ve translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit operating income and earnings per share growth, while also delivering on restructuring initiatives and funding significant investments across the firm that will drive future growth. As I reflect on our performance through the first half of the year. First, as Greg noted previously, organic revenue growth both year-to-date and for the trailing 12 months with 6% overall, reflecting continued improvement compared to our historical trends as we deliver on our goal of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth over the long-term. As mentioned previously, in addition to strong performance across our core portfolio from net new business generation and improved retention. Our disciplined focus on maximizing return on invested capital continues to shape the portfolio towards our highest growth and return opportunities. As highlighted by the divestiture of certain businesses and Retirement Solutions in the second quarter. Second, we delivered strong operational improvement with double-digit operating income growth of 10%, operating margin expansion of 210 basis points, and double-digit EPS growth of 11% for the first half of the year. As we noted in the earnings material, FX rate continue to have an unfavorable impact from results in the second quarter due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar, resulting in significant net unfavorable impact of approximately $0.18 or $53 million impact on operating income. I would also note that the second quarter included $5 million of additional interest expense resulting from the $750 million of 3.75% senior notes issued on May 2, 2019. Going forward, we expect approximately $81 million at interest expense per quarter, reflecting both the issuance of additional term debt and higher average debt balances compared to the second quarter. Additionally, we continue to successfully execute against our restructuring initiatives with $38 million of incremental savings in the second quarter. I would highlight that we provide an update to the restructuring program in this quarter, as we are now two quarters away from the end of the program, and a better clarity into projects and program initiatives. We now expect to deliver $510 million of annualized savings in 2019 and $535 million of annualized savings in 2020, reflecting an increase of $35 million in total expected savings. Total cash investment is expected to increase a $100 million, reflecting a $125 million in cash restructuring charges offset by $25 million decrease in CapEx associated with restructuring program. All restructuring charges will be completed by Q4 of 2019. Our ongoing restructuring initiatives are driving expense savings near-term, but more importantly, they’re enabling growth of the firm as we unlock additional operating leverage through our Aon Business Services single operating model. For example, we’re driving digitization within our centers of excellence as part of our Aon Business Services organization. Our centers of excellence were created to focus on automation of common services across Aon with the goal of increasing process efficiency and reducing manual error-prone activity. More specifically, we are automating the manual aggregation of insurance data from carriers to improve data quality and accuracy. Reducing turnaround time for clients and enhancing the overall client experience. We can apply similar automation to a variety of common services across our businesses to reduce late time, improved quality and accuracy as well as free uptime for our client-facing colleagues to be more productive. We anticipate automating approximately 500,000 hours in 2019. Looking beyond 2019 in our restructuring initiatives, organic growth, portfolio mix and ongoing productivity improvements are expected to drive continued operational performance and long-term core operating margin expansion annually. Similar to the 70 to 80 basis points of operating margin improvement achieved annually over the last decade. Lastly, free cash flow declined $47 million to $255 million. Strong operational performance through the first half of the year and decline in restructuring cash outflows was more than offset by approximately $85 million of net cash payments made in the first quarter related to legacy litigation. As we think about cash flow generation going forward, we’re focused on maximizing the translation of acceleration revenue growth into the highest level of free cash flow through three ways: operating income growth; continued progress on working capital initiatives and structural uses of cash winding down. 2018 was the peak year for cash usage as shown in our presentation Slide 27. Declining uses of cash for restructuring CapEx and pensions collectively are expected to free up $585 million of free cash flow by the end of 2020. With the update to restructuring estimate this quarter, we now expect to modestly higher cash outflows related to the program in 2020, primarily offset by a $35 million increase in annualized savings, resulting in a neutral impact to our strong free cash flow growth outlook from 2018 to 2020. We continue to have significant upside to a base of more than $1.45 billion of free cash flow in 2018 prior to any operating income growth or working capital improvement. Together, these inputs give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of double-digit growth in free cash flow over the long-term. Further, we have the opportunity for incremental debt, while maintaining current investment-grade rating. As EBITDA grows, restructuring costs wind down and pension liability improves, providing significant financial flexibility over the next few years to further invest in value creation or return of capital to shareholders. We are diligent about maximizing return on capital and make capital allocation decisions through this discipline. Share repurchase remains the highest return on capital activity today, given our free cash valuation and outlook, highlighted by the $1.15 billion of share repurchase year-to-date. In summary, our Aon United initiative continue to create momentum as highlighted by our strong top and bottom line performance through the first half of the year, including significant investments to strengthen the long-term growth profile for our firm. Our disciplined approach to return on invested capital, combined with expected significant free cash flow growth and increased debt opportunity over the next few years, provides financial flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long-term. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to the operator, and we’d be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Dave Styblo from Jefferies.
David Styblo: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Greg, I want to maybe start out with a higher level question that the broader management team could answer over the next few years here. So you guys have been running a quarterly organic growth rate of 6% for a year now as you guys mentioned. I know you’re targeting mid-single-digits or better over time. And it seems like you’re already in that range. Curious what has maybe gone better than expected and how sustainable are the results. Maybe in that context you could talk a little bit about the survey work that you did and bringing value to the clients in the areas of risk readiness and what Aon can do different than competitors that allow you more opportunities to serve the client.
Greg Case: Well, Dave, I appreciate the question. Really – it is really very much at the heart of what we mean when we talk about Aon United. In essence, we have an approach, which as we break down barriers and bring our global firm to bear on behalf of client needs opportunities come to pass and they’re very, very strong. But you start really with client need. The survey I described is really quite unique. It relates to survey that goes out every two years. It’s around the world. We actually quantify with our or ask our clients what are the things that are most on your mind, what affects your business. And I’m looking at the survey going back to 2007, and you essentially look at the top 10 risks and ask the question, which one actually are – which ones are insured and which ones are not, which ones can you really match capital. And when you look in 2019, of the top-10 risks, only one, only one is fully insured, 4 others are partially insured and the rest 5 are not insured at all. So the opportunities from a client demand standpoint continue to go up. That means our world as we lean into it from an Aon standpoint is not just winning from – in the current business, which we’re then very, very effective at and very, very fortunate. Win rates are at an all-time high and momentum is very positive. But really it’s also the net new. It’s addressing client issues around cyber, intellectual property and all things that come with that. And in that regard, what we’ve been able to do is actually think about a world in which how can we address client needs more effectively over time. And for us, that is really across every solution line we have, all the pieces and you are seeing progress in each one of those. So our view is we are making good progress as we’ve highlighted. When we describe the impact of Aon United it really is around, truly around client value and growth and greater opportunity for our colleagues. And you’ve seen us drive net new client opportunities from the Aon United behavior. You’ve seen net new ideas and innovations around cyber, IP, mortgage and reinsurance for an example, delegated sort of on the retirement investment side. You continue to see share gains, I described before. And really, you’ve also seen portfolio mix in terms of sort of what we’re doing overall. And when you think about – this really comes back to kind of how our colleagues are working together in a little bit different way. And I’ve used examples, we used examples on the call and maybe Mike, pick an example so that highlights sort of overall, sort of how the colleagues are working together differently and really to Dave’s question, what does it mean at the client level and how does it affect what we do.
Michael O’Connor: Sure, Greg. Maybe I just pick a client, an existing great client of ours, happens to be in the financial services space, and plays in the payments world. This a great client of ours, but with our Enterprise Client Group, we’ve identified a process by which we want to have colleagues take a lead for us and actually have our entire team that was connected around the world step back and think about this clients, really think about the strategic priorities that that client is facing and how we might actually help serve them more effectively. And in this case, they step back and say this client had a couple of things that really popped out that we thought were important. One was they’re in a war for talent. At the end of the day, if you think about the payments world, this is a technology game and they’re actually in a war for talent around technology talent. The second was their core business. How do they drive retention in their payments products and increase spend with their clients. And the third was they’re always in the world trying to think about how they reduce risk and pre-deploy capital. Our team came together across the globe and tackled these 3 strategic priorities for that client. In the war for talent, our health team and our rewards and performance team came together and thought about how can we better optimize the entire proposition to their employee base, whether that’d be existing employees, they can help retain or attract new ones. And working with that client we’re able to improve the actual proposition that they could give to their employees. Our Affinity team jumped in, in their core product, and brought together our proprietary insights around – the analytics around their insurance offerings on their payment products. And by actually optimizing those solutions in the marketplace, we actually improved the client experience around claims and that led to better retention and increase spend on their core products. And lastly, we looked at their retirement plans and said there is an opportunity here to de-risk. In the environment they’re in, we can de-risk and re-deploy the capital. You come away across those three strategic priorities we’re able to touch and improve with that client, their operating performance and make them more competitive. And to us, that’s the manifestation of Aon United and that’s what really inspires our teams to have impact with clients.
Greg Case: And I think, Mike, just to pick up on the point, because I think what you’re describing is our enterprise client network, which is essentially a group of high performing individual client executives who deal with our largest clients. We’ve created a group that actually pulls them all together. So instead of just having one individual insight, we’re able to create the pattern recognition that actually allows us to scale that insight and get it across the globe in a way that brings all of our solution lines to bear on any given particular client problem. So it really does help us consistently improve as time goes on, but also to learn from each individual client experience and get it to all of our leading client executives. So, Dave, all of our questions, I promise we won’t answer at that length. But you’re – this is truly fundamental. This is really what’s happening at the cool phase, which we think is different and we think really changes. It isn’t just about winning in the current world; it’s changing the size of the pie and doing things on behalf of clients that actually help them succeed. So we’re – you can tell, we’re pretty excited about it. We think it’s having an impact. And we think we will continue to build over time. But thanks for the question, really appreciate it.
David Styblo: Thanks. Just a quick follow-up for Christa on the cost savings, can you talk a little bit about what the additional fine there is? And then as I look at the guidance for this year to achieve this year’s $510 million target, the average in the second half would imply a quarterly run-rate of about $140 million, I suspect that would actually be ramping up as you exit the year, but even if we took the $140 million average and annualize that, I get about $560 million of savings for 2020. So my question for that side would be: why isn’t your 2020 target more like the – higher than the $535 million that you’ve established?
Christa Davies: Thank you so much for that question, Dave. So I think your first was quite a long question, so let me try and answer it and you can come back and tell me I’ve missed a bit. So I think the first question was where are the activities coming from that are increasing the program. And I guess, what I would tell you is we’re two quarters away from the end of the program until we got better clarity into the projects and program initiatives, both the projects currently being implemented as well as the addition of certain remaining projects in the program. So to give an example, Dave, a lot of the increases in workforce reduction, we formed great partnerships with outsourced providers to actually outsource significant activities to centers of excellence in India and Poland. And they’re actually improving the quality and standardizing processes for us and reducing error rates for our clients. And so, we’re thrilled about that outcome, whether that’s occurring in shared services in areas of finance or whether it’s occurring in our middle office as I describe with the automation of claims and premium processing for clients. And so, we’re very excited about that sort of – that level activity, because it’s overall improving efficiency and improving quality. Then I think your next question was really around the math of – on the second half of the year. I think your estimates were roughly right in the second half of the year. We’re, obviously, improving savings in the second half of the year. I think your next question was around the $535 million in 2020 and why doesn’t higher. I mean, I guess, you could always ask that question, Dave, but I think we feel really confident about delivering the $535 million in 2020 and we have great visibility to that now that we are two quarters away from the end of the program. And the last thing I would say is all restructuring charges will finish in Q4 2019 as originally anticipated.
David Styblo: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you very much. Good morning. First question is just around the organic margin improvement of just over 90 basis points. Can you maybe talk about some of the moving parts there specifically maybe FX?
Christa Davies: So FX had an immaterial impact on margin in the quarter. I mean, the real – the biggest driver of margin expansion, it continues to be accelerating organic revenue growth, portfolio mix shift as we continue to invest in higher revenue growth, higher margin areas. And then the operational leverage we’re getting from Aon Business Services. Those three drivers remained consistent overtime. I would say that’s contributing to margin expansion in the quarter, in the first half of the year, and frankly the same for 2018, but equally going forward.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, if I look at the free cash flow number for the quarter, not year-to-date, on an underlying basis, I think, there is slight deterioration year-over-year. Can you maybe talk about what has – what’s caused that?
Christa Davies: So what we would say actually is strong growth and operating income growth, which is driving strong growth in free cash flow, both in Q2 and in the first half of the year. And what you’re really saying is strong growth operationally, offset by a onetime payment of legacy litigation of $85 million. If you took out the $85 million, what you see is underlying good growth in free cash flow. The thing, I would also noted, the first half of the year is our seasonally weakest half. And so combined with litigation payment of $85 million resulted in lower free cash flow for the first half. The second half is – free cash is strong. And long-term, we are absolutely on track for double-digit free cash flow growth.
Yaron Kinar: So I think the litigation expense was a first quarter event. I’m looking at second quarter here, I think by my calculation, you have about $350 million of underlying free cash flow in the second quarter, when I just back in the $110 million or so of the cash restructuring costs in the second quarter. And then, I think that is a bit weaker than where numbers were a year-ago.
Christa Davies: So we really think about on a first half basis, I appreciate your second quarter guidance. And what I would tell you is, we see strong underlying growth and free cash flow driven by strong operating income growth. And again, the second half of the year is going to be stronger and free cash flow as it is seasonally every year, and so we’re well on track to strong growth for the year.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, guys. My first question, I guess, just following up on that on free cash flow, I thought that you guys had expected double-digit adjusted free cash flow growth in 2019, when we adjust for the restructuring cash spend. So with that still be the case? And then assuming, Christa, you just add seasonally stronger and half year two. So do you still expect the half year two to drive you guys to double-digit for the full year?
Christa Davies: Thank you so much for the question, Elyse. So what we’ve said consistently is that where double-digit free cash flow growth over the long-term is absolutely our goal, and we are well on track to that. We’ve not given specific guidance in this year, Elyse, but what I would say is, we expect strong growth and free cash flow in the second half of the year and strong growth for the full year. And we are well on track for accelerating growth in 2020, driven by accelerating organic revenue growth, which is driving improvements in operating income growth. A reduction in working capital and a significant reduction in the uses of cash on pension CapEx and restructuring. And so those three drivers are continued to accelerate free cash flow growth and there will be a substantial acceleration of free cash flow growth in 2020, simply driven by reduced uses of cash.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of the share repurchase picked up significantly in the second quarter over $1 billion, you guys also did issue some debt during the quarter. So just in terms of the timing, I’m sure, when the debt was issued versus when the shares were purchased. I’m assuming, I’m sure if some level of buyback was frontloaded from other quarters of the year. Could you just give us a sense of just thoughts around repurchase and the debt and kind of timing when that took place in the second quarter?
Christa Davies: Yeah. So the debt was issued May 2, 2019, that was $750 million of debt at 3.75%. And what I would say, Elyse, is as we think about the overall free cash flow generation of the firm is incredibly strong. As we think about the spend of that free cash flow. We used return on capital, as the way in which we allocate cash between buyback, which remains our highest return on capital activity as you’ve seen first half of the year $1.15 billion invested in buyback. And we continue to see share repurchase as our highest return on capital activity going forward. And so we have strong free cash flow in the second half of the year, as we talked about, and frankly, in 2020 onwards. And we expect a return on capital to drive our cash allocation and share repurchase will be at the top of that list.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then lastly on the organic side, four quarters in a row of 6%, I listened to the comments throughout the call, you guys seem pretty bullish on the growth environment. So should we think about this as just kind of being a 4%, would you expect going forward would at least meet this 6% level, especially as you pointed divesting of businesses also good new business generation, strong pipeline it seems based on your survey work. So should we think of the 6% as kind of a 4% on the organic side that you should see not only the second half of this year, but into 2020 and beyond as well?
Greg Case: Well, I would say, Elyse, listen, we talked about mid-single-digit or greater, and what we try to do is give you a clear view and the tactics behind that, the mechanics behind that, the investments behind that. And we are confident we’re going to achieve that over time. And this quarter and the first half of the year and the last four quarters have done nothing, but underpinned that confidence. So we’re looking forward to achieving that on your behalf.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Paul Newsome from Sandler O’Neill.
Paul Newsome: Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Can you maybe talk about just the organic growth lift you may or may not be getting in the PC Brokers business from the current environment and perhaps the insurance price?
Greg Case: Sure. Happy to do that and just a couple of thoughts on that. First, we would say when you think about sort of the impact on our results. This is Aon. This is sort of single P&L, single op-co, single brand in terms of what we’re trying to do. And you look at overall to, Elyse’s just question around mid-single-digit or greater. That’s we’re on track to achieve, that’s we want to achieve over time, and over half of Aon is really unattached to anything sort of related to the risk market or risk pricing overall. But we would say specifically when you think about commercial risk and reinsurance the impact from pricing was modest for the quarter and for the first half of the year. And remember when you think about pricing, it really is around market impact, which is a function of insured value and a function of price. And from our standpoint the real driver has to start from a client view. We’re essentially matching capital with risk in a way to support their performance. And they react to changes in the marketplace and we help them react to changes in the marketplace, and there’s lots and lots of different options out there to do that and accomplishes work. And so the real driver of our growth is we’ve described is really around client opportunities, Aon United behavior, new opportunities I’ve described before in cyber and other innovations, continued share again and portfolio mix shift. So that’s really what’s underpinned the book of what we do and the impact on pricing really was modest.
Paul Newsome: Maybe some similar thoughts on the global economy and how that is helping you or not helping you?
Greg Case: Again, we’d come back and say, the whole idea on the global economy everyone’s talked about sort of the pending efforts and what’s going to happen on the recession. We have not actually seen that materialize. But beyond the economy, we talked about growth and irrespective of the environment. And I would come back to the kind of the survey that I talked about before, this is truly from a client’s view. What risks are we serving on their behalf and how are those risks changing. And in essence, there is massive opportunity for us to continue to really address client needs, increase our relevance and change what we’re doing. I talked about the New Ventures Group and what we’re doing in many different areas, the work I described in public, the public sector world is very, very different. And just think about an example of sort of what that might be maybe, Eric can just talk about what we’re doing on that front now. This is a net new idea, fully net new idea, Paul, that’s not out there. These are the kinds of things are trying to do to drive growth, and maybe just talk about the public sector piece. Eric?
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg. And maybe I’ll try and tie the public sector piece along with the demand creation and some of the growth questions as well. Ultimate with public sector, we’re seeing the private market tools on the derisking solutions become more available to them. The benefits to the sector itself are pretty significant in terms of reducing their risk profile that helps them with their mission. It reduces the risk of taxpayers, but it also helps them continue on and do what they’ve been set up to do. We’ve talked historically about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the GSEs and transfer that credit risk exposure into the private market using essentially tools that were developed historically in the reinsurance business, but repurposed to be able to bring new demand, new capability to a whole new sector. We’re also doing that and you mentioned before the World Bank bond, but also with the Export-Import Bank and other government agencies both in the U.S. and around the world. So ultimately, it’s taking the analytic capability that we’ve been building and investing in, and being able to create new demand and new opportunity to help a whole new set of clients. So it really does come together with both the investment that we’ve made in the analytic capability, but also the opportunity to bring private market solutions to public sector entity.
Greg Case: And so fundamentally, Paul, this is about us investing in innovation, new ideas. That’s why the spend in data analytics is so substantial, we believe fundamentally. If we innovate on behalf of our clients faster than they do, we’re never going to know their businesses better than they do. But we can innovate faster them on the topics of risk, retirement and health. We do that investments, we do that effectively you create net new ideas, like Eric’s described and that’s what for us is going to be the fundamental driver of growth over time.
Paul Newsome: Great. Thank you for your thoughts.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. A couple of quick question. Greg, I’m just curious, I’m looking into Reinsurance Solutions growth you see in the first half, I think I go back, and it’s probably off sort of the best growth you’ve seen since, call it, 2003 in a hard market, so obviously, some great things going on there. Can you talk a little bit about what’s driving that?
Greg Case: Yeah. Let me just step back a little bit, Brian, just sort of the overall mechanics and again get Eric to sort of offer some thoughts on sort of the general state of the market sort of at the client level. But listen, the Q2 12% was a terrific result. Colleagues have just done some great work, really just 10% for the first half. Remember, also the first half really reflects the 3D book more than anything else, the [one-ones, the four-ones, and the six-ones.] [ph]. The second half is less 3D, and more fact in the ILS transactions. But we’ve talked many of these calls around the win/loss record has been exceptional for multiple years, and this is a place where again back to data analytics point, we spend more heavily in content capability here than perhaps any place else, and that shows up from a client standpoint. So for us, this has been continued progress and support and a good result. And we expect over time will continue to sort of help clients succeed in the category, but maybe, Eric, talk about a client example or so.
Eric Andersen: Yeah. I mean, I think, what I would sort of walkthrough also is certainly there is growth in the treaty business as you talked about, but also in the facultative reinsurance business and the banking business. So we’re seeing good opportunity across all the different capabilities that we have. And I would say a lot of the demand is coming from the insurers, who are looking to use reinsurance capability, whether it’s the analytics in the modeling or the sort of positioning and use of reinsurance capital to help them grow their own businesses, whether it’s in the traditional high risk natural catastrophe areas, but also in the growing areas of cyber and others specialty liability areas. So we’re seeing good growth globally and the demand has been continuing as the carriers look at this marketplace and try and position themselves the best that they can do to help their ultimate clients grow and manage their own risk.
Greg Case: Yeah. I want to be clear. As you think about 12% in Q2, we’re not 12% over there. What we’re essentially saying we don’t look at the quarter-to-quarter for us it’s less relevant. The trend line has been very, very positive. And Eric just described two or three net new areas that didn’t exist before, an example that didn’t exist before driven by data analytics. Our view is there are a number of clients out there, who really want to improve their return on invested capital, and reduce their volatility, as we have solutions to do that. We’re going to continue to grow their business, that’s we’re really excited about.
Brian Meredith: Great. Great. And then, Greg, I’m just curious, and Eric, tell a little bit about what you’re seeing as far as the commercialized pricing environment. And you’re talking with your own numbers, it just a modest benefit. But it was some of the carriers it sounds like things really have picked up quite nicely, and we’re kind of this farming marketplace. Is that what you guys are seeing?
Greg Case: I would say again, I want to emphasize the impact on us we described as modest, we would say modest upward pressure overall maybe a little more on the cat exposed areas are really modest overall. Again we would come back to the real relevant question is market impact, insured values and price, Brian, and as you know well. The real point of view from the question really from our standpoint, every time it’s asked, we believe it has to be repurposed and it has to be from a client view. The work of what we do every day is going to be about matching capital with risk and weighted that supports client performance operationally, reducing volatility, stronger balance sheet, et cetera. Again, you know this very well. That work from our standpoint is fundamental and there are many, many options out there, many, many permutations. And clients really have to be the drivers of that. And that’s where we would say there’s been some modest impact. But this is really a client-driven set of conversations.
Brian Meredith: Right, right, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Josh Shanker anchor from Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning.
Greg Case: Good morning, Josh.
Joshua Shanker: Following on Dave’s question little, but I just want to understand the process of – I guess the restructuring is just a little bit more expensive than you thought it was. And I was interested in hearing from you about like the process, when you identified that going on, what happened, and why should we should be confident there’s no more restructuring charges in 2020 and beyond.
Christa Davies: Sure. So thanks for the question, Josh. The uptight climb just reflects better estimates now at two quarters away from the end of the program. We’ve got better clarity into projects that are currently being implemented, as well as the addition of new projects as we optimize the overall Aon operating model. And so, what we would say is overall we’re delivering $535 million of savings. We’re spending $1.425 billion in cash. It’s a 38% ROIC. We feel really good about that. And so, we are absolutely confident, Josh, to your question that the last charges will be completed in Q4 2019. We’ve been consistent about that from the beginning. We’re very keen to get back to GAAP EPS equaling adjusted EPS and running the business on free cash flow as we always have.
Greg Case: So I notice you had a couple of just points on sort of the restructuring, particularly that’s coming to the close. Remember, this is not about cost saves. There’s a lot of cost saves in concert with it. This is really about fundamentally changing and strengthening our firm. And fundamentals of this is what we’re doing in ABS and sort of – and that engine that’s being created never been done before in our industry. We have the opportunity to step back and invest to do that. And we made real progress against it. But it really is an engine that really we are very excited about that’s going to deliver productivity going forward and client impact going forward. But the piece around this is really sort of on the client side and sort of how they see this and how this comes out. And I figured that Mike could give an example of sort of the ABS front and sort of what we’re seeing and how it’s not just cost, but also it’s more than cost.
Michael O’Connor: Sure, Greg. I mean, I think with Aon Business Services, this is all about improving our effectiveness, our impact with clients, and obviously, on productivity. And there’s countless examples that come to mind. You can think about our single global platform for health. We’ve delivered, rolled this out now into 50 countries and we actually now operate with one single system, able to touch clients around the world in single way. We have one single system that will run and to support our Commercial Risk business, around policy management and the way we actually interact with clients. Our Risk/View platform is what we call it internally. And you think about those that’s changing the way we touch clients every day. It’s giving us a single way a single approach. And for us being able to actually bring all of our data together, which allows us provide insight that we couldn’t do before. So those are just two examples that we’re really excited about.
Greg Case: And it’s about cost saves for sure and ROIC. And then, fundamentally, we end up with a stronger firm, which is why were we were excited and we initiated the program to begin with. And we’re looking forward to 2020 and 2021, and the benefits that come with the investment we have made and completed by the end of 2019.
Joshua Shanker: Thank you for the answers. And then dovetailing on Brian’s question a little bit, can talk about the organic growth in reinsurance in the context of, how much of that was taking share from competitors and how much of that was creating new solutions for clients that didn’t exist before?
Greg Case: Well, listen, as we said before it’s a combination and we love both pieces. And in fact, a lot of the a data and analytics investments we’re making out, are really about net new. And think about some of examples that Eric gave that really is around kind of net new ideas in net new areas, and whether it’s sort of in – the areas we describe sort of on the mortgage side or on the cap on side, now with governments, a whole series of things that are happening that we’ve never done before. Our win/loss you know continues to be favorable and strengthening. But it’s more than just win/loss. Our view is the risk needs of clients is more than a zero-sum game, because the industry is fundamentally not – we have not fundamentally addressed a growing set of needs they have. So for us, this is really the opportunity, not just on the reinsurance side, but also on the commercial risk side.
Joshua Shanker: Would it be crazy to say 50/50?
Greg Case: Again, I think it’s less helpful I think to sort of talk about pure win/loss. Eric’s itching to sort of give you that exact answer. Do you want to go on it?
Christa Davies: But I think, Josh, your question really is how much of it comes from whole new areas of growth and how much it comes from win/loss. And interestingly, a lot of our new wins are actually new solutions to clients that we’ve never even done with them before. And so, as it features in our win/loss, it’s actually kind of hard for us to tell candidly, Josh, because we are – our win rates are at all-time highs across the firm, across commercial risk in our top 10 countries, across reinsurance. But a lot of the wins are actually coming through Aon United investments and the investments we made in data and analytics, which allow us to develop new solutions for clients we couldn’t otherwise serve them with.
Greg Case: So just think about, what Christa is really touching on perfectly is when we’re in a tender we don’t show up in the classic way. We can actually show up with new ideas and new insights driven by data and analytics. And so is that a win sort of in the zero-sum game world from a competitor or is that really sort of net new? So really that’s the combination we’re seeing. And then, occasionally mortgage, pure net new. That’s a $10 billion sort of opportunity that’s been developed over time. I think, Eric, 20% of the mortgages in the U.S. now are connected to insurance linked capital. So this is an incredibly powerful net new, but it really is a combination. What we want you to get a sense for is, this is this is fundamentally about delivering more on behalf of clients using data and analytics, and the investment to do that is substantial, but the impact can also be quite high.
Eric Andersen: And I think also part of it is when people think of reinsurance they think of the traditional 3D transfer of portfolios. But there’s also other work that we’ve been creating to help clients and reinsurers think about their own portfolios. And maybe just a quick example is a mid-size reinsurer I’m thinking about, that wanted better insight into how many of their clients would either put them into the market or not renew with them. And we were able to use some machine learning and predictive analytics to help them focus on where they needed to spend their time either building relationships with their existing clients to be able to target to know where they were at risk. And so, just having that kind of insight helps them improve their retention capability, helps them know where to focus their management attention on maintaining the share that they had earned over a period of time in the marketplace. So it’s not just about, hey, we want to transfer this portfolio of casualty or natural disaster risk to a marketplace, but it is actually helping each of the individual players be smarter and how to position their own businesses for growth and success. So there’s a lot to it, but not just traditional share, but is actually bringing new services to the market.
Joshua Shanker: Well, thanks for the answers and congratulations on the quarter.
Operator: Our last question, it is from Meyer Shields from KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. I want to talk a little bit about the M&A environment, so one general question, one specific one. The press release noted that you divested, I guess, a unit within Retirement Solutions that offset organic growth. And I was hoping you could reconcile that with the general approach of actually increasing acquisitions, faster growing units. And then, more broadly, I was hoping you could talk about the opportunity, the M&A environment globally and how it’s been evolving over the last 12 months.
Christa Davies: So what I would tell you overall is we are active managers of our portfolio. We have been over the last 5 years; we’ll continue to be in the future. And so, we will continue to disproportionately invest organically and inorganically in higher revenue growth higher margin higher return on capital businesses. And we’ll divest lower revenue growth, lower margin, lower return on capital businesses. And that’s what we saw happen in the quarter with a small portion of the talent business that sits on the retirement that was divested on June 30. So it did not impact our organic growth calculation in the quarter, but it was lower growth. And so that is what you saw. And then, I guess, what I would say about the overall M&A environment is we – I said last quarter, our M&A pipeline is the largest. It’s been in the company’s history. It is aligned to our highest revenue growth, highest margin, the highest return on capital categories, so we’re very excited about that. And we continue to engage with these companies to actually build long-term relationships to we’re the buyer of choice, because what we don’t really want to be is in an RFP where we’re competing with a whole bunch of people. We actually want to get to know firms that are really attractive in our highest return on capital areas and really bring them into the firm in a way that’s building content and capabilities for clients and enabling a cultural fit that really makes that integration successful.
Greg Case: And in many respects, Meyer, it really is about the content capability and what net new comes to Aon from an inside standpoint, and then how do we scale that. And you’ve seen that in many, many of our acquisitions we’ve brought into the firm. And you’ll continue to see that as a primary driver, because without that, you really don’t get a return on invested capital that beats buyback. And our view is from a discounted casual standpoint, there’s tremendous value sort of in the buyback that’s why it continues to be sort of at the top of the list and sort of everything is measured against that. And it really is opportunities around content capability that really drive that sort of actions.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That’s what I needed. Thank you so much.
Greg Case: Okay.
Christa Davies: Thanks, Meyer.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: Just wanted to say to everyone, thank you so much for joining us in our Q2 call and we look forward to the discussion next quarter. Thanks again.
Operator: That concludes the conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-26 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2019 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc. You may now begin.
Gregory Case: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. In addition, we have our two Co-Presidents, Eric Andersen and Mike O'Connor, joining the discussion to help lead our Q&A session with their frontline perspective of Aon United at work.  Similar to previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website as we focus our time of these quarterly calls to provide you more insight into the longer-term view for the firm. I'd like to start today by acknowledging the tremendous work of my Aon colleagues around the world. Their collective efforts continue to strengthen the firm and create long-term momentum, reflected through positive performance across our key metrics in the first quarter, including 6% organic revenue growth, reflecting a strong start to the year, with an increased rate of growth across all solution lines; substantial operating margin expansion of 190 basis points; 8% operating income growth; and double-digit or 11% growth in EPS, overcoming meaningful FX headwinds.  Our strong start to 2019 is a direct reflection of initial success from the strategic actions we've progressively taken to drive Aon United. As we've discussed previously, we've been laying the foundation for Aon United for over a decade, evolving our portfolio, investing in new content and capability and increasing our relevance with clients. In 2018, we took major steps to reinforce and amplify this progress through structural changes that broke down barriers and began to make it easier to deliver the best of the total firm to clients: 1 brand; 1 leadership team; 1 P&L to deploy capital against; 1 operating model under Aon Business Services; and most compelling, a new united global professional services firm, all focused on increasing our relevance and strengthening our ability to self serve clients more effectively. We also organized focused teams of leaders to dedicate more time to value creation for client-driven solutions that can then be applied more broadly and faster with similar clients or industries, with the formation and the development of our enterprise client group to lead Aon United efforts with our largest clients by identifying superior [indiscernible] solutions that address their specific business objectives. And our New Ventures Group to accelerate industry-leading innovation and scale our capabilities with greater speed to market.  During Q1, we announced our first commitment to develop our innovation portfolio with Intellectual Property Solutions. As businesses recognize a paradigm shift from tangible to intangible assets, IP is more important than ever, with the tangible assets now comprising the majority of assets on the balance sheet. Our clients need to both identify and manage risks surrounding business-critical and proprietary data and develop and execute strategies for maximizing shareholder value from their IP portfolios. Beginning with the acquisition of 601 West in 2018, the IPS team has already developed a set of consulting, evaluation and risk transfer offerings that establishes Aon as the trusted global authority in the intellectual property asset class, an area of opportunity that we believe will be substantial for Aon over the long-term.  With our strong start to 2019, we are truly in the era of Aon United. The foundation we've been putting in place, combined with our more recent actions, have already demonstrated accelerated revenue growth. As you can see from the improved trend of 3% in 2014 and 2015, 4% in 2016 and 2017, 5% in 2018 and now 6% to start the year in our largest quarter. And these actions will continue to be a driving factor, reinforcing our goal of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth or greater over the long term. This improved growth outlook for the firm is predominantly driven by 3 key areas. First, as a baseline, we operate in core markets with attractive long-term growth globally. Risk continues to increase around the world in both magnitude and complexity. Health care has significant cost inflation in most geographies with deteriorating wellness. And many of the world's pension plans are underfunded with employees unprepared for retirement. Our core businesses across these areas are characterized by high recurring revenue of approximately 85% in primarily nondiscretionary markets, with strong client retention rates of approximately 95% on average across the portfolio.  As the world increasingly faces political and regulatory changes or economic pressure, we find our clients needing our advice and core competencies even more as they navigate challenges and uncertainty across the topics of risk, retirement and health. This view is reinforced by the data and analytics insight of our Inpoint team, a team comprised of more than 300 data professionals across 3 innovation centers globally. Through unique insight into the global commercial P&C market, our team has developed a standardized data set which describes the size and segmentation of commercial lines insurance, unique in the market today. For example, our research, which segments the global market in detail by product, industry client size, estimates that global premiums totaled approximately $625 billion in 2013, $730 billion in 2017 and will increase to nearly $900 billion by 2021, reflecting an increase in market growth rate to more than 5% annually. Using this proprietary data, we are identifying unique insights across solutions, industries and geographies for clients and Aon as well as prioritizing capital towards these highest growth opportunities.  Second, our strategic focus was reinforced by the divestiture of our outsourcing business in 2017, with proceeds from the transaction directed to our high-growth areas of client need. In 2018, we delivered a record level of organic revenue across the portfolio, with that momentum continuing in the first quarter of 2019, drawing from many of the areas where we continue to invest heavily, delivering double-digit growth, including cybersecurity, transaction liability, delegated investment management and voluntary benefits to name a few. While other areas of the business are just beginning to emerge, such as intellect our property and data and analytics applications. While many think of cyber in the traditional sense of risk transfer of premium, we're working well beyond that with some of the technology industry's leading participants, with solutions like Side Queue, a software assessment tool critical for implementing cyber resilience across their product portfolios.  And third, we're creating new opportunities with clients through our Aon United model. With a business partner approach, we're looking more effectively across geographies and solution lines to help clients in ways that improve their growth profile, reducing volatility or strengthening their balance sheet. And while I've already noted colleagues working together through formed groups, like our enterprise claim group and our New Ventures Group, I want to highlight the spirit of Aon United through 2 colleague examples, both of whom have already won accolades from clients as perineal players on the power broker list. It's not that Aon has more industry recognized colleagues than anyone else or the accolade itself for their specific industry expertise, it's the underlying behavior they exemplified to solve unique solutions for clients. The first example highlights work with an autonomous vehicle startup, where there was no loss data to model. With no protection, there was no future for this client. Our colleague was able to bring together capability across the firm, encompassing cyber and product liability, resulting in protection, capital and a future for the client. My second example highlights the work of a colleagues on an M&A transaction for a client. The seller was unwilling to identify specific major tax liabilities identified by the buyer. No solution, no deal. Working with colleagues across the firm to understand the risk, our colleague was able to bring 13 carriers together in one of the largest tax insurance programs ever placed, ultimately enabling the deal to get completed. Quite simply, this is the power of our colleagues and our Aon United approach. Our clients are driving this and our colleagues are responding.  In summary, our results reflect increasing strength from our Aon United initiatives as highlighted by increasing growth. We continue to strengthen our firm through investments in industry-defining content and capability, while delivering strong financial results and increased value to our shareholders. Our team is excited about the future outlook for our firm, which is amplified by the considerable momentum we have built together. With that overview, I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our progress and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a strong operational and financial performance in Q1 to start the year. Q1 results were highlighted by strong organic revenue growth that translated into operational improvement, while funding significant investment across the firm and overcoming an unfavorable near-term impact from FX translation. As I further reflect on the quarter, first, organic revenue growth accelerated 6%, continued improvement compared to our historic trend as we deliver on our goal of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth over the long term. In addition to accelerating organic revenue growth, discipline around capital allocation continues to shape the portfolio towards our highest growth and return opportunities as highlighted by the divestiture of certain businesses in our talent practice after the close of the quarter. While financials were not disclosed, the divestiture of these businesses provides Aon with capital that can be reinvested, while enabling the buyer to create value for clients.  Second, we delivered solid operational performance with total operating income growth of 8%, operating margin expansion of 190 basis points and double-digit earnings growth. As we noted in the earnings material, FX was modestly worse than previously anticipated due to a stronger U.S. dollar, resulting in a significant net unfavorable impact of approximately $0.13 in the quarter or a $38 million impact on operating income.  Looking beyond 2019 and our restructuring initiatives, organic revenue growth portfolio mix and ongoing productivity improvements are expected to drive continued operational performance and long-term core margin expansion annually, similar to the 70 to 80 basis points of operating margin improvement achieved annually over the last decade. We continue to successfully execute our restructuring initiatives, with $45 million of incremental savings in the quarter before reinvestment, placing us well on track to deliver on our total commutative savings of $500 million in 2019. These initiatives are driving expense savings near term, but more importantly, they're enabling growth of the firm as we unlock additional operating leverage through our Aon Business Services single operating model.  In addition to core restructuring activities, another Aon United initiative I'd like to highlight is sales process standardization. As a firm that was initially built through acquisitions and then organized around multiple businesses and segments, our colleagues routinely found it challenging and time-consuming to understand who our clients were and how best to serve them across Aon. With Aon United and a single operating model under ABS, our colleagues spent the last year standardizing our client-facing sales process. With global agreement from colleagues to cover every sales process across the firm, we undertook an in-depth process to dissect and reassemble very disparate sales data into 1 instance. We began with 1.3 million accounts, and through mastering account data and clean up, we eliminated more than 800,000 accounts, reducing the total to 500,000 client accounts in a standardized approach and process. Our client facing colleagues are now more productive, with increased time for clients as well as greater operating leverage through simplification of our sales process. A great example of our colleagues working together across the firm to drive long-term growth and operational leverage.  Lastly, free cash flow was $17 million for the quarter. Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter from a cash flow standpoint due primarily to incentive compensation payments, with results further impacted by approximately $85 million of net cash payments related to legacy litigation. As we think about cash flow generation going forward, we're focused on maximizing translation of accelerating revenue growth into the highest level of free cash flow through 3 ways: operating income growth, continued progress in working capital initiatives and structural uses of cash winding down. 2018 was the peak year for cash usage, as shown in our presentation Slide 24. It was the peak year for restructuring cash outlays and certain discretionary pension contributions. Declining uses of cash for restructuring, CapEx and pension collectively are expected to free up roughly $620 million of free cash flow by the end of 2020. This adds significant upside to a base of more than $1.45 billion of free cash flow in 2018 prior any operating income growth or working capital improvements. Together, these 3 inputs gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of double-digit annual growth in free cash flow over the long term.  Further, we have the opportunity for substantial incremental debt as EBITDA grows, restructuring costs wind down and pension liability improves, providing significant financial flexibility over the next few years to further invest in value creation or return of capital to shareholders. We are diligent about maximizing return on capital and make all capital allocation decisions through this discipline. Share repurchase remains the highest return on capital investment today, given our free cash flow valuation and outlook. In summary, our Aon United initiative continues to increase momentum as highlighted by our strong top and bottom line performance in the quarter, including significant investments to strengthen the long-term growth profile for our firm. Our disciplined approach to return on invested capital, combined with significant free cash flow growth and increased debt opportunity over the next few years, provides financial flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Speakers, our first question is from Dave Styblo of Jefferies.
David Styblo: I just want to take a look back at the margins here for a second. And so the restructuring savings accounted for 140 basis points of the 190 basis point margin expansion year-over-year, which leaves about 50 basis points related to more core expansion. And I think you guys have typically characterized that that's net of reinvestments in the business. So I just want to make sure I've got those moving parts right. And then, if you could direct actually talk about maybe how large those reinvestments were this year? And if there's anything else impacting the margin line, including FX, did that affect the margin at all this quarter?
Christa Davies: Dave, as we think about it, it was a terrific margin expansion, total margin expansion in the quarter, 190 basis points. As you highlighted, we have been investing significantly back into the business into high-growth, high-margin, high-return-on-capital areas. That was significant in 2019 Q1 as it was for the whole year of 2018. And so what you're seeing with the restructuring savings of 140 basis points contributing and then your core. The core is really net of significant investments in the business. And so we really think about this, Dave, as 190 basis points of margin expansion. And then I did mention in my prepared remarks, for the last 10 years, we've delivered 70 and 80 basis points a year of core margin expansion, and we expect that trend going forward post the restructuring. So we're very excited about the margin expansion in the quarter and for the calendar year 2019 outlook.
David Styblo: Sure. Okay. And then just on the reinsurance. Maybe taking more of a longer-term approach and understanding how the sales reorganization is helping that business to whatever extent it might be, but obviously, the business has been running in the high single digits organically for a year plus now, which obviously is quite strong relative to historical levels. I'm wondering if you can talk about if there's -- how durable that business is. Oftentimes when we see growth that high, we think of one-off items maybe being spiked out and helping it, but it's been consistent for a longer period of time at this juncture. So maybe you could talk about some of the underpinnings of the market there from what you're seeing in the pricing side to capital supply to demand.
Gregory Case: Dave, I appreciate your raising the question. I think, actually it's inappropriate really to talk, even without Reinsurance, for sure, but more broadly about really the drivers of growth in Reinsurance because they really are consistent across what's happening across the portfolio for Aon. We need to step back and think about it. And Reinsurance colleagues did a phenomenal job and have for quite some time in the core treaty business, the fact business and what we're doing on insurance like securities as well. But if you think about consistent with Aon growth overall, the team is really doing a great job. The solution lines -- every solution line we have is up over the comparable period from the prior year, and this is the third consecutive quarter with Aon at 6%.  So there's a lot going on here, and it's not driven by one-offs, it's not driven by market conditions. It's driven by, fundamentally, sort of how we're approaching the market frontline, client, leadership and the commitment really to Aon United. And it really is bringing the best of our firm to our clients, innovative things that are happening that haven't happened before. And we're strengthening our ability to scale that innovation more effectively across the firm. And as I described in my comments, in essence, if you think about the core markets we operate in, these are markets with high recurring revenue, strong client retention, and fundamentally, the demand is up. And we still operate in a world in which we don't serve clients in a complete way.  We, as the industry, and all of us have opportunities, and we're trying to take advantage of that. So these are core markets with great opportunity. And then our investments that Christa just alluded to, both organic and by acquisitions, are really focused on higher growth demand areas from clients: cyber, IP, delegated, health, talent, et cetera. And in the end, what happens here is we're expanding markets and we're increasing relevance. And in doing so, we're winning more with clients, more with existing clients where our rollover is high -- at the highest levels and improving. We're winning net new clients, where new business generation is as high as it's been and improving. And again, we're back to creating net new areas to serve clients. Think about mortgage, ACT, delegated, health exchanges, World Bank, cat bond, MVG. And if you think about it, all of these areas really connect back to data and analytics. It's an absolutely vital piece of that overall equation. But maybe -- again, just because this idea of growth is so fundamental to what we're doing, Eric and Mike, let's go through a couple of examples that will sort of bring to life what's really different and what's really driving the fundamental underlying growth.
Eric Andersen: Sure, Greg. Why don't I kick it off and then Mike can follow. But just staying with the reinsurance theme, one of the areas where we're really focusing our teams is being able to use our data and analytics capability to be able to provide actionable insight for our clients, whether insurance or reinsurance partners. And one of the key areas is, by providing that insight, they're able to alter their strategy. They're able to look closely at their capital allocation capability around how they drive product and the geographies, et cetera. And just to maybe pick a simple example, we're working with 1 reinsurer who had some challenges in their property portfolio and we were able to use our world-class capabilities along with our team to be able to help them understand what was going on inside the portfolio and then make decisions around how they entered the market, where they entered the market and how they allocated capital towards those risks. So it affected their strategy as well as affected their capital allocation strategy, and honestly, created a great result for them.
Gregory Case: I mean, a fundamentally different kind of conversation than we've had before, beyond the placement, it was about the corporate strategy of the firm.
Eric Andersen: Ultimately, the placement is the last thing that we're doing. It's all the work that's done upfront around helping them understand what the risks are and how it's working, and then, how do you allocate capital to those risks.
Gregory Case: Look, Mike, do you want to throw one in?
Michael O'Connor: Yes. I mean, Eric covered risks, so maybe I'll touch on other parts of our business. And a recent example that I thought was quite good, actually, and I found it inspiring. We had a client in the technology services space which we were serving across risk and health, doing a great job, great client. But the team stepped back in a really Aon United's fashion and said, "What's the biggest challenge that this client has?" And the biggest challenge this client has was talent. The growth of that firm, the growth of this client, the success of this client is going to depend on can they actually attract and retain talent. So our team said, "What can we do to help?" And we rallied. We brought together colleagues from health. We're brought together colleagues from talent rewards. We brought together the whole firm and sat with this client and said, "What can we do differently?" And we reached back and grabbed the data and analytics that we have in all these practice areas and said, "Can we use this to actually improve performance?" And on the health side, last year, we rolled out a set of tools, and we called it Aon Architect, which we built in our innovation center in Singapore. And that doesn't happen without bringing together our actuarial team, our data scientists and our practitioners to say, "Can we pull together all the data, all of our experience from around the world and house it and use it?" And what we ended up building was a cloud-based, data-driven machine learning tool, which has an algorithm that draws upon all that data that says, "If a client gives us sort of parameters that they want to build their health program around, can we optimize it? Can we actually improve it?" And that's what we brought to bear with this client. And with a click of a button, we can run thousands, even millions of simulations to come up with the optimal answer. Now that's interesting. But what's even more interesting is we've coupled that with an employee perception database. We went and did research around when we make changes to a health program, how will different populations of employees react. Will they be excited? Will they be actually annoyed? Or will they be indifferent? And that combination allowed us, for this client, to bring not only an optimized answer but be able to show them how their employees would react at different levels of the organization, different populations of their employees. That was insight they didn't have before and allowed them to improve the offering they had and have more impact with their colleagues. We coupled that with our Talent & Rewards practice, who said, "Listen, we've got to make sure that our rewards and recognition for this client are as competitive as they can be. We need to know what's going on in the market, and we've got to think about, with the investment they can make as a client, how can we best optimize that answer for their employees." We coupled that, an improved health offering with improved rewards and recognition. And this client was able to go to market with a more compelling offer to attract clients -- or attract employees into their firm and also retain them. And for me, it's just a great example of utilizing data and analytics to have real impact with a client.
Gregory Case: Okay, I know a little bit of an extended answer, but we wanted to give you a sense on sort of, again, back to the spirit of what we're trying to do with these calls, this is about the long-term future of the firm and what we're trying to accomplish fundamentally underpinning everything we're doing from a growth standpoint, starts and stops with clients, and it is really a much, much broader approach and picture than anything we've ever taken before. So hopefully that gives you some background.
Operator: Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question, just on the free cash flow that you guys saw in the quarter. I know that Q1 is typically your low -- lower cash quarter, but you did have a legacy litigation-related payment. Was this contemplated when you guys had set kind of the double-digit growth on an adjusted free cash flow basis for the year? And you can just kind of give us an outlook on the growth trends over the remaining 3 quarters.
Christa Davies: Thanks, Elyse. Yes. We definitely are on track to double-digit free cash flow for the full year 2019, and legacy litigation was encompassed in that guidance, Elyse. And what we would say is exactly what you said about Q1. It's our seasonally smallest this quarter. We had big outflows of cash. We always have big outflows of cash in Q1 due to annual incentives. In this quarter, we had additional outflows of cash related to legacy litigation and restructuring. And so what you see is we're on track to double-digit free cash flow for 2019. And we're really excited about the free cash flow growth over the course of '19 and particularly '19 and '20, given the declining uses of cash in restructuring CapEx and pension adds $620 million of free cash flow just in the next 18 months.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then in terms of organic. Last quarter -- last Q1, sorry, there were some timing where some business in a few of your segments had shifted from the Q1 to Q2. Was there any kind of timing impact on organic this first quarter that we should think about when thinking about Q2 or any other quarters of the rest of the year?
Gregory Case: There really wasn't, Elyse. And so we described before the fundamentals of the drivers of growth are what we're talking about in terms of how we're interacting with the clients and the things we're bringing to the table. So there is no -- there was nothing that affected it in Q1.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Great. And then in terms of you guys mentioned you've done some acquisitions that have helped your organic growth. As we sit here today, can you just give us an updated view on the deal flow that you see out there and types of things and sizes and geographies of deals that you guys are looking at and contemplating?
Christa Davies: Yes. I mean, Elyse, we are incredibly excited about our M&A pipeline. It is the largest we have had in the company's history. I think I mentioned that on the Q4 call. And it is 100% focused on our highest revenue growth, highest margin, highest return on capital areas. It mirrors the areas we have been investing in organically and inorganically in the last couple of years. So it's things like data analytics, health elective benefits, Affinity, delegated investment management, cyber, intellectual property. And so we're incredibly excited about the M&A pipeline, Elyse. Having said that, we continue to be really disciplined about return on capital. And I would say, on a return on capital basis, that's exactly how we allocate cash across the firm. And share repurchase remains the highest return on capital across Aon. And so we're very excited about the share repurchase outlook for Aon in the balance of the year.
Gregory Case: And these are really starting, Elyse, as we think about sort of these opportunities, these are opportunities to bring in content capability that we can scale. This is back to kind of the data and analytics piece that we've talked about in terms of how we take this and how we actually broaden it out from a client standpoint. Or actually, we're seeing action now. We're seeing clients who've asked us for this kind of insight. And that's a direct response to that are some of these acquisitions that we've done to bring in content and capability. And particularly as you think about some of the things that we've done in cyber and things that we've done in the health side and the talent side and the risk side, they've really started to make a difference. Again, just in the spirit of the call, a couple of examples sort of come to mind, I was thinking about, Eric, we talked about it a couple of days ago, maybe we share it with the group and [indiscernible].
Eric Andersen: Sure. There was a -- Sure, Greg. There is a -- just a quick story just to underscore some of the points around how we're trying to globally integrate and use all the different solution lines to drive new outcomes for clients. We had a large European manufacturer who had a sizable Latin American presence but was having volatile challenges around the pricing of their health care for their employees in Latin America. And we were able to use the European client leader, the Latin American teams, who then drew upon the global solution capabilities. And we were able to provide a solution that reduced the volatility and helped them better manage the outcome, with an added benefit of being able to actually collect the health data on their Latin employees, which will ultimately give them the tools that they need to improve wellness. And so that ability for our own employees to be able to work collectively like that, really exciting for them and really gets them going. So it's been a -- was a great example, I thought.
Gregory Case: Again, Elyse, trying to help you understand, this is really about content we scale, and when we scale it and it responds to client needs that's -- and we're taking an approach which is fundamentally different around bringing colleagues together in unique groups. These are the kinds of outcomes driven by clients. So that's really what's driving our acquisition appetite.
Operator: Our next question is from Greg Peters of Raymond James.
Charles Peters: I'll take a swing at two questions. First, in your comments, you talked about organic growth driving margin expansion beyond 2019. I think you mentioned, if you look over the last 10 years, you have an annual average increase of 80 bps to 90 bps. I'm just curious if you guys have a view about any type of structural ceiling that might exist on margin expansion, considering that many of your competitors are running at lower margins?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, for the question. What I would say is we see substantial margin expansion over the long term for Aon, really driven by 3 key things. The first is accelerating organic revenue growth. The second is a mix shift to higher growth, higher margin businesses. And the third is the productivity we're building into the business through the Aon operating model, driven by ABS. And to your kind of margin ceiling question, one of the things that we're observing is as -- due to the investments we made in data and analytics, $400 million a year for the last 11 years now, we are getting greater operating leverage in the business because we're really driving greater value for clients. And data analytics is at the heart of that and these data analytics solutions are having a huge impact on clients in terms of the value they provide.
Gregory Case: If you really back into it, Greg, and thinking about sort of the definition of client need and how we respond to client need, in the examples that Eric and Mike have gone through today really aren't traditional examples. They're sort of net new examples that are out there. And they're very high value-added examples with content and capability that really create a way for us to add value in ways that clients recognize and, frankly, we get paid for because we're adding meaningful value to clients. And for us, we think there's -- this is a massive opportunity. Again, back to the growth drivers in the quarter. It's both kind of net new opportunities. We're creating new markets. You think about what we did in mortgage, that's net new market. What we're doing in cyber, taking a $4 billion business and driving it forward to more of a -- hopefully, a $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, $50 million, 100 -- $100 million business over time. This is a very, very substantial net new opportunity. So for us, as we add value to clients, we believe we're going to continue to be compensated for it and margins are going to continue to go up.
Charles Peters: Okay. I realize your health business is a global business. And it also, in the U.S., there's been a lot of attention around the political arena and recently Medicare For All. And I'm curious about your perspective on the health business in North America. I know you guys have been a leader in a bunch of different initiatives, including private health insurance exchanges. And considering the political landscape is changing, I'm curious about your long-term perspective on that business.
Gregory Case: For us, health comes back, as does everything else, to clients and client need. And when you think about sort of what's really happening with all these different options, are we fundamentally addressing questions around our -- is the population becoming healthier and are we decreasing the premium or cost of health care. And really nothing is addressing that at this point in time. But if you think back to your broader question, start with Aon, we've got a -- the broadest set of solutions globally serving clients of all sizes, segments, industries, the full spectrum of funding choices out there. As you said, roughly half our business is outside the U.S., including, frankly, very, very productive strong growth in areas that support clients today in existing single-payer systems like the U.K. and Canada. So let's assume that all happened, we've operated extremely successfully in those markets. Why, because were helping companies help their employees succeed and do better on the health side. And that demand is going to continue and we can succeed in that marketplace. Our U.S. business, as what you could describe it, is really broken into two pieces. One, addressing the question you're asking specifically, clients who -- advice and solutions for medical and dental. And the other, serving clients with advice and solutions around voluntary benefits, executive benefits, global benefits, et cetera. So we see a tremendous opportunity to help clients help their colleagues or help their employees on this really, really difficult topic of health. We will always come back to if we can help clients inject choice, transparency and accountability for their employees, we're going to improve the situation, and we are very confident that we're going to have success in whatever end state sort of that ends up. I would also observe, if anything this monumental, and obviously, it would be monumental, happened, the transition also creates massive client uncertainty and ambiguity, which we would be in the breach trying to help them sort through. So in the end, we are very confident in the end state, and we're confident in the transition.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski: First, I have a follow-up. In terms of the Intellectual Property Solutions and mortgage, which are areas that Aon is pioneering insurance demand for. What do you estimate is the size of insurance for those lines of businesses today. And maybe you can help us frame how to think about their long-term potential size.
Gregory Case: Well, let's start, actually, with intellectual property. I think it's a good one to start with. Because, again, back to the whole idea sort of net new on the horizon, step back in time and think about kind of intellectual property has always been out there, but in 1975 it was 20% to 25% of the overall kind of assets on the balance sheet. Today, it's more like 80% plus. And if you asked the question, how has our industry responded, how have we helped clients think about that? And the answer is it's actually quite, quite limited. This is why -- back to kind of our New Ventures Group identified this as a priority area. We've got assets around this focused in ways we never have before. We're doing things to help clients understand how do they value their intellectual property, how do they think about it, how do they assess it. We've also helped them understand sort of how to benchmark it and understand how they create value against it , and obviously, how you protect it around liability, cover for patent copyright, trademark infringement, et cetera. Thinking about IP as collateral. If it's truly an asset, how do you actually get value out of it? And then, if someone does something bad to you, if they steal it, how do you protect yourself against it. So for us, this is a -- we think, a massive emerging opportunity, largely underserved. And I want to be really clear, we've got -- we're in the market now. We've got clients, ready-made clients sort of that we're actually doing real work with in a very meaningful way. Again Eric and Mike, you guys are living this every day at the front line. Pick a couple that you think are interesting to talk about.
Michael O'Connor: Sure Greg, maybe I'll start. And then Eric, if you have any that you want to add on. I mean I think this, as, Greg, you noted it, if you think about IP and step back, the reality is this is relevant to all our clients all around the world. And when you actually start to engage with the clients around it, you realize that this needs to be top of the agenda for a lot of those clients. And I'd just use one example, a very sophisticated financial services organization, we sat down and talked to them with our IP Solutions team, and it was really interesting. The dialogue really was in two buckets. One was around offense and one was around defense. On offense, that firm is literally spending their time and their IP organization within it just thinking about how do they actually define the spaces where the business can grow. How do they actually map the landscape. And we were really engaged in a strategy conversation.  We were talking to them about what their current IP was, how strong their portfolio was and where there was whitespace. And that, to me, is really interesting in building really strong client relationships. And that's all about their offense, how they get stronger as a firm, how they grow. Then we flip over and talked about defense. That team, internally, had a responsibility in that client to defend the IP they had to basically make sure they were actually managing risk. And that quickly turned to how do we actually think about the risk they have. How do we quantify that with them, and then ultimately, do we transfer some of that. And last year, we stood up an industry leading IP liability solution in London. And the client quickly said, "This now is relevant. The capacity you've brought, the sophistication of the underwriting community that you've brought together is different than it has been in the past." And it quickly led to, we should transfer more risk. And to me, that's a perfect example of us engaging with clients in an Aon United way, helping them play both offense and defense.
Gregory Case: So again, so you see us, Mike, there from that standpoint, how many companies around the world have this issue? We would say most. What are the real solutions in the market today that help them address it? And they're minimal. And so, we see this is a true kind of emerging area that we think could be substantial. Just quickly on mortgage. If you think about it, once upon a time, mortgages sort of were funded and originated in a certain way. We had some trauma in 2007, 2008, 2009, created some need. We came in and actually helped bring insurance capital to bear on behalf of the U.S. mortgage instrument, which is the single largest financial instrument in the world, and in creating what literally is, over time, a market that's greater than $10 billion in premium, really phenomenal, and it was really on single-family. And we are about to sort of roll that now into multifamily sort of in the next wave of that. So these are opportunities that bring real solutions, reduce volatility, bring real pricing insight into this marketplace and another example of where you can bring insurance-linked capital sort of to bear on behalf of a client to reduce volatility or to improve operating performance.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. One follow-up. In February, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority published their wholesale broking practice study and essentially okayed the industry's practices for most part. Do you feel that will speed up the trend towards risk facilities?
Gregory Case: Yes. We don't really look at it that way. In essence, what -- the market overview, the work that was done, frankly, for us, just reconfirmed what we see every day. This is a highly competitive market, a transparent market. Our focus, our objectives remain exactly the same. And that is to match capital with risk around the world in any way we can. And that's traditional-based capital from the insurance world but also the nontraditional capital as well. And so for us, it really didn't change our point of view in any way, shape or form. We are absolutely focused on helping clients understand, measure and mitigate risk and bringing to bear solutions in any way we can. So really it didn't change anything.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith: I'm just curious, Eric and Mike, I'm wondering if you could talk about what's going on in the commercial P&C market, particularly E&S? There's been a lot of discussion recently that things have kind of really picked up with respect to pricing in E&S markets, given some stress at Lloyd's and other carriers. Are you seeing the same things? And kind of what's your take on what's going on in the market right now, commercial market?
Gregory Case: Just quickly, Brian. So I will come back on pricing. Same conversation we've had really for the last number of quarters. When you think about pricing overall as it relates to sort of the results for us and where we are, pricing has had minimal marginal impact, if at all, really, from the standpoint of sort of how it's affected us. This is really about market impact overall. It's insured values and pricing on top of it. And the pricing piece has really been -- it's been marginal. The fundamentals of growth, from our standpoint, really have to do with the factors we've talked about in the call today. It really is around sort of the underlying things we do with clients every day, and that's really what's driving overall performance. And sort of that's the overall market view. Eric or Mike, anything else you'd like to add to that?
Eric Andersen: The only thing I would add to it, Greg, is that we take a client-by-client approach, and they look at their own risk portfolio and their own risk program. A lot of work goes into risk managing as opposed to risk transferring. But ultimately, when they risk transfer, they make the best trades for them. That make sense?
Michael O'Connor: And I think the only thing I'd add, Eric, is we've enabled our field with data and analytics to basically dive deep into each client and be able to actually represent that effectively. And the second part is we have a global network. We will find the right solution and match capital with need wherever it is in the world.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then Greg, my second question, I just noticed in the presentation you talked about double-digit growth in China health care. Could you just give us a sense of where you are in China? How big is that as a percentage of your kind of overall business? And kind of what are the opportunities there for you all?
Gregory Case: There's a tremendous set of opportunities there, Brian, as you might expect. We've been in China for well over a decade, a very successful joint venture sort of in China with our joint venture partner, COFCO, and a tremendous opportunity. And we're making substantial investments. In fact, our New Ventures Group is focused on China as one of the key areas we're looking at. And we see the opportunities, by the way, on the risk side. We see opportunities on the health side, on the talent side, on the retirement investment side. So it really is across the board. And while not a big part of the overall results today, we see tremendous promise going forward much like intellectual property, not a big part of the results but with huge, huge upside and opportunity for us going forward, and China continues to be a big focus.
Operator: Our next question is from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker: Two questions basically around the same area. I'm trying to just get a better sense of understanding how your working capital needs are going to change with regards to a cash flow over the next 9 months and into the 2020 year? And also, looking at the market rally in the first quarter of the year, trying to understand how to think about contributions to pensions above expenses in the income statement.
Christa Davies: Sure, Josh. Firstly, on working capital. We see opportunity for improved cash flow from working capital. As I've said it previously, we've got about $500 million of excess receivables in working capital sitting on our balance sheet. We do believe that we're going to get to working capital neutral over the long term. And so there's about $500 million of excess cash coming from working capital over that period of time. So we do see the opportunity to improve cash flow from working capital. There's no need for increased working capital, if that was really your question. And then on pensions, you can see on Page 24 of the presentation. Our pension contributions are coming down significantly. You saw, in 2018, which is the peak year of pension contributions, $252 million. They're coming down to $117 million in pension cash contributions by 2020, so a substantial drop. And obviously if interest rates were continued to rise, the impact of the discount rate, you could see that come down even further.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Molloy of Bank of America.
Andrew Molloy: My question follows Elyse's question really and is really focused on financial and balance sheet policy. We've seen a pickup of debt financed M&A in the space recently and wanted to know your thoughts and philosophy on the M&A pipeline using balance sheet to finance the potential deal flow and commitment to the 2 to 2.5 leverage rage that's in your presentation.
Christa Davies: Great. Thanks so much for the question, Andrew. Our current investment grade rating is incredibly important to us. We do have opportunity for more debt, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, given growing EBITDA are driven by growing revenue, operating leverage, disciplined expense management and decreased restructuring expense keeping leverage levels the same. We think about the right leverage levels as debt-to-EBITDA in the 2.25x on a GAAP basis. So we absolutely see the opportunity for increased debt as EBITDA grows, but leverage will remain the same. And as I mentioned in terms of how we utilize the substantial free cash flow we're going to generate, we're deploying that on a return on capital basis. And we're optimizing share repurchase, organic investment and M&A based on return on capital. Share repurchase remains our highest return on capital opportunity across Aon given our free cash flow valuation of the firm.
Operator: And your last question is from Sean Reitenbach of KBW.
Sean Reitenbach: Obviously, Aon has posted strong organic growth recently. Would organic growth or margin expansion, for that matter, be stronger without Brexit as an overhang?
Gregory Case: Yes, Sean. When you think about Brexit, it has tremendous, obviously, trauma and implications for our clients around the world, and we've gone to great pains and efforts to sort of protect them sort of in, frankly, whatever scenario. And if you know, then let us know what that's going to be, but we've protected every scenario around that on behalf of our clients. It's been an added expense for us, no doubt about that, added level of investment, and frankly, has drawn attention from our senior leaders down to our frontline leaders in every way. But net-net, we want to be prepared for our clients, and we're going to work through it in every way we can. For us specifically, we feel very good about our ability to work around that.
Sean Reitenbach: Okay. That's helpful. And then, finally, on share repurchases have decelerated it looks like each quarter since first quarter '18. I know you have mentioned it as your highest return on capital investment, so just wondering what's driving the deceleration whether you expect it to pick back up for the rest of 2019.
Christa Davies: Thanks for the question, Sean. We certainly do expect it to pick back up in the balance of the year. And as we think about Q1, it's our seasonally smallest cash flow quarter. We traditionally have big outflows of cash on our annual incentives in Q1. And this Q1 specifically, we had additional cash outflows on legacy litigation and restructuring. We are on track for double-digit free cash flow for 2019, and share repurchase remains our highest return on capital opportunity, so you'll see share repurchase pick up for the balance of the year.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory Case: I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us this quarter and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you and that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.  It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc. Please go ahead, Greg.
Gregory Case: Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. In addition, we have our two Co-Presidents, Eric Andersen and Mike O'Connor, joining discussion again this quarter to help lead our Q&A session with their frontline perspective of Aon United at work. Like last quarter, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website as we increasingly focus our time on these quarterly call to provide you more insight into the longer-term view for the firm. I’d like to start today by acknowledging the tremendous work of my Aon colleagues around the world. Their collective efforts drove a strong Q4 and finished the year with positive performance across each of our key metrics in the fourth quarter, including 6% organic revenue growth despite a strong comparable in the prior-year quarter, substantial margin expansion of 280 basis points, 16% operating income growth, and 19% growth in EPS. And a similar performance across key metrics for the full year, highlighted by organic revenue growth of 5% for the overall portfolio, our strongest level of organic growth since 2006. And EPS of $8.16 for the year delivering on our near-term target to exceed $7.97 in earnings per share, a target set nearly two years ago with the divestiture of our outsourcing business and the acceleration of our Aon United journey. Our strong results in 2018 are a direct reflection of initial success from the strategic actions we’ve progressively taken to drive Aon United. As we’ve discussed previously, we’ve been laying the foundation for Aon United for over a decade, evolving our portfolio, investing in new content and capability, addressing client demand, all focused on increasing our relevance and strengthening our ability to serve clients more effectively. In 2018, we took additional major steps to reinforce and amplify this progress through structural changes that break down barriers and make it easier to deliver the best of the total firm to clients – a single leadership team, a single P&L, a single brand, a single operating model and, most compelling, a more united global professional services firm.  We also organized focused teams of leaders to dedicate more time to value creation, with the formation of our New Ventures Group to accelerate industry-leading innovation and identify ways to better scale internal abilities with greater speed to market. An Enterprise Client Group to lead Aon United efforts with our largest clients to identify superior, tailor-made solutions that address their specific business objectives, both of which are unlocking significant value for clients and creating new solutions that can be applied more broadly and faster with similar clients or across industries. As we now look ahead to 2019, we truly enter the era of Aon United. These actions taken together have already translated into accelerated revenue growth to date, as you can see from the improved trend of 3% in 2014 and 2015 to 4% in 2016 and 2017 and now 5% in 2018. And we will continue to be a driving factor toward our goal of mid-single digit organic revenue growth or greater over the long-term. We’re excited about the improved growth outlook for the firm, which is really driven by three key areas. First, as a baseline, we operate in core markets with attractive long-term growth globally. Risk continues to increase around the world, both in magnitude and complexity. Healthcare has significant cost inflation in those geographies, with deteriorating wellness. And many of the world’s pension plans are underfunded, with employees unprepared for retirement. Our core businesses across these areas are characterized by high recurring revenue of approximately 85%, in primarily non-discretionary markets, with strong client retention rates of approximately 95% on average across the portfolio. And as the world increasingly faces political and regulatory changes or economic pressure, we find our clients needing our advice and core competencies even more as they navigate challenges and uncertainty across the topics of risk, retirement and health.  Second, we continue to strengthen our business mix. Our strategic focus was reinforced by the divestiture of our outsourcing business in 2017, with proceeds from the transaction directed towards high-growth areas of client need. In 2018, we delivered a record level of organic growth across the portfolio. In fact, we generated approximately $500 million of organic-related revenue, drawn from many areas where we continue to invest heavily, delivering double-digit growth including cybersecurity, transaction liability, delegated investment management, and voluntary benefits, just to name a few, while other areas of the business are just beginning to emerge, such as intangible assets and data and analytics applications. And third, we are creating new opportunities with clients under Aon United. With a business partner approach, we are working more effectively across geographies and solutions lines to help clients in ways that improve their growth profile, reduce volatility or strengthen their balance sheet. One example of this work in 2018 was when our data and analytics team joined forces with our reinsurance and commercial risk colleagues to develop a new solution for an existing client. Having already worked with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop the US mortgage market for single-family homes, which created $10 billion of new capacity and now accounts for 20% of the single-family mortgage market, our Aon United team brought their shared capabilities into the multi-family home market. This is a truly great example of colleagues coming together to create new solutions for clients and create new markets for Aon. And here’s how this unique solution was developed. Our reinsurance team worked with our data and analytics colleagues to develop proprietary analytics that translate the complex multifamily exposures into risks that the reinsurance market could price, effectively creating a standard and making a new market. Our commercial risk team then made the transaction possible by creating a financial vehicle that translated the reinsurance capacity into a primary insurance policy that could be purchased. And that’s the power of Aon United, creating new solutions for clients, brought together by collaborations of colleagues from across Aon, all driven by the insight from new industry-leading data and analytics capabilities. In summary, 2018 was another year of delivering on our commitments and meaningful progress. We took several substantial steps to strengthen our firm, all while delivering strong financial results and increased value to our clients. As we begin 2019, our team is excited about the future outlook for our firm, which is amplified by the considerable momentum we have built together. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our progress this year and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg. And good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered a strong operational and financial performance in Q4 to finish the year. Q4 results were highlighted by strong organic revenue growth that translated into substantial operational improvement. Core operational performance contributed 10% of the 16% operating income growth and 100 basis points of the 280 basis point increase in operating margin. Turning to the full year, I’d like to start by discussing the achievement of our near-term EPS target of exceeding $7.97 per share for the full year. I’m pleased to report that we delivered $8.16 of EPS for the year, far exceeding the $7.97 threshold. As Greg noted, we set expectations two years ago at the time we announced the divestiture of our outsourcing business to hold shareholders neutral from a dilution standpoint. Over the course of the last two years, we’ve had some items move in our favor, noting a positive impact from FX translation and the tax rate a bit better than when we set the target; and some items move against us, noting unfavorable impact from FX balance sheet evaluation and the implementation of new revenue recognition standards. Strong organic revenue growth, core operational improvement, successful execution against our restructuring initiatives and effective capital management have enabled us to exceed the target, while also enabling a significant amount of investment to position the firm for future growth. As I reflect further on full-year results, organic revenue growth accelerated to 5%, continued improvement compared to our historical trend as we deliver on our goal of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth over the long-term. In addition to accelerating organic growth, M&A is continuing to contribute, both improving the mix and driving total revenue growth of 8% for the full year. We delivered substantial operational improvement with operating income growth of 18% and operating margin expansion of 220 basis points. Core operational improvement contributed 10% or more than half of the operating income growth year-over-year and 60 basis points of operating margin expansion, noting that this includes the absorption of near-term investments to support the long-term growth initiatives that Greg mentioned. We also continued to successfully execute against our restructuring initiatives that not only drive expense savings through the three-year program, but, more importantly, create greater scalability, productivity and operating leverage beyond 2019. I would highlight that we provided an update to the restructuring program this quarter as we are now in the final year of the program. Total estimated savings increased by $50 million to $500 million in 2019, with $150 million increase in cash spent and an additional $50 million increase in non-cash charges. We do not expect any further adjustments to the total estimated program costs or annualized savings through the remainder of the program, which will be completed in Q4 of 2019. Looking beyond 2019, ongoing productivity improvements, combined with accelerating revenue growth and a portfolio mix shift for higher margin businesses, are expected to drive continued long-term core margin expansion. We have delivered 70 basis points to 80 basis points of operating margin improvement on average per year over the last decade. Reported free cash flow increased substantially year-over-year to $1.45 billion, reminding you that the prior year included cash tax payments related to the divestiture.  Strong operational improvement, combined with working capital improvements in both receivables and payables, contributed to year-over-year growth, partially offset by $80 million of discretionary pension contributions and certain costs related to our restructuring program. I would note that 2018 was the peak year of restructuring-related cash usage. As we think about cash generation going forward, we are focused on maximizing the translation of accelerating revenue growth into the highest level of free cash flow through three ways – operating income growth, continued progress on working capital initiatives, and structural uses of cash winding down. As I noted previously, 2018 was the peak year for cash usage, as shown in our presentation slide, as it was the peak year for restructuring cash outlays and certain discretionary pension contributions. Declining uses of cash for restructuring, CapEx and pensions collectively are expected to free up roughly $620 million of free cash flow by the end of 2020. This adds significant upside to a base of $1.45 billion of free cash flow in 2018, resulting in $2.1 billion of free cash flow prior to any operational income growth or working capital improvements.  Together, these three inputs give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of double-digit annual growth in free cash flow over the long-term. We have opportunity for substantial incremental debt as restructuring expenses wind down and pension liabilities improve, providing significant financial flexibility over the coming years to further invest in value creation or return capital to shareholders. We are diligent about maximizing return on invested capital and make all capital allocation decisions on this basis. This is highlighted by the $1.4 billion of share repurchase in 2018, which remains the highest return on capital investment, given our free cash flow valuation. I would highlight return on invested capital continues to improve as we shape the portfolio, with a 380 basis point increase year-over-year to 21.6% in 2018, driven by operating income growth and a reduction in capital. In summary, we delivered on our full-year commitment to shareholders, while making significant investments to strengthen the outlook of our firm going forward and returning over $1.4 billion – $1.8 billion directly to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends in 2018. The success we achieved this year provides momentum as we head into 2019 and supports our expectation to continue to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long-term. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to the operator and we’ll be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Dave Styblo: Thanks and good morning.
Gregory Case: Hi, Dave.
Dave Styblo: First question just would be, picking a head just for 2019 – and appreciate the additional color on the cost savings. Those are obviously tracking ahead. So, maybe not at all surprised that you guys increased it, but the incremental $140 million for 2019, how should we think about that growth amount, how much of that might drop to the bottom line as you guys look at investments or have you made already a lot of large investments that you had planned on doing in the business already?
Christa Davies: Dave, as we think about the restructuring program overall and the $500 million of savings we’ll deliver in total in 2019, we are absolutely reinvesting a portion of those savings as we think about return on capital as the metric we use to allocate all forms of capital usage. And so, we haven't given specific guidance about the amounts of the $500 million we will reinvest, but you should expect us to reinvest given the substantial opportunities we have for organic investments across our portfolio. And, really, the way you can track that is you should expect us to continue to expand the operating margins long-term based on the investments we’re making.
Dave Styblo: Okay. You guys had made comments of what you've done over the last decade. As the margins have increased over time, is it getting to a point where it’s harder to replicate that same level of margin expansion or you guys continue to look at the business for accelerating organic growth and these operating efficiencies and productivity? Is margin expansion along those lines sustainable?
Christa Davies: Yeah. So, Dave, we actually think we have substantial room for further margin expansion over the coming years really driven by three key elements. The first is accelerating organic revenue growth. The second is portfolio mix shift. We’ve done a huge amount of work on portfolio to actually continue to invest in higher revenue growth, higher margin businesses. And the third is the work we’re doing on the Aon operating model overall, which of course is delivering the $500 million of savings in 2019. But much more important than that, Dave, it’s actually driving productivity improvements in each year after that. And so, we feel really good about the opportunity to continue to drive margin expansion going forward.
Gregory Case: And when you think about it, Dave, when we described Aon United and the impact it’s having on our firm, we principally talk about this as it relates to client-facing capability, which is we think exceptional and strengthening. And I gave one example in my comments. I can talk about more today if it’s helpful. But it’s good to describe. This is not only external in our client-facing world, but also internal and how we think about how we go to market, how we actually create effectiveness, benefit going to market, but also efficiency in the context of doing that. And ABS is really an opportunity to take a look at our firm in a way we’ve never ever done before and actually create this opportunity. So, it really is – it’s new news when you think about productivity and operational leverage that has started to already show benefit and continue to play out. I don't know, Mike, if you want to give an example of sort of what ABS is about and how you see it show up in the marketplace.
Michael O'Connor: Sure, Greg. Maybe – and there is countless examples. But maybe one that’s very easy to relate to is our call centers. We are touching clients every day. And in the past, each of our solution lines across any geography would actually do that and do it exceptionally well. The reality is with Aon United, we looked across the geography. And during 2018, we took our North American call centers and basically said, listen, if we actually think about this in an integrated way, if we think about it across solution lines, what’s possible? And the reality is we started to integrate those capabilities across the geography. And I think as we come out of 2018, we have two things. We have an improvement in effectiveness, which we can track; and secondly, we reduced our total cost by almost a quarter. So, for us, it’s just one example. And we can, obviously, take on the road around the world, but that’s an example of where we are bringing Aon United to life, increasing the effectiveness, improving the client experience and, ultimately, driving productivity and efficiency.
Dave Styblo: Great, thanks. The last one I just had was, Greg, one of the biggest pushbacks I get or questions from investors is the goal mid-single-digits are higher. Can you maybe try to unwrap that a little bit more as you go forward over the next several years and talk about those drivers? How you do that in an environment where GDP is materially lower than that? And, obviously, there are these new opportunities in cyber and flood and so forth, but they still seem pretty small relative to how they might contribute to the overall top line? So, can you help maybe investors and we understand a little bit more how you could possibly reach the higher end of the target there? 
Gregory Case: Dave, this is a terrific question. Really appreciate raising. This is really at the heart of Aon and what we are about in Aon United and what we are so excited about. If you step back and sort of what’s the basic foundation for this progress – and, again, if you look back over the last number of years, you've seen the progression, right, against sort of good markets and lesser markets, good economies, lesser economies, 3% growth, 3% growth, 4% growth, 4%, now 5%. And, fundamentally, it’s based on market share gain in the core business and you’re seeing that all around the world, all across our solution lines. You’re seeing, as Christa described, a portfolio mix which has stored faster growth areas. So, literally, as we think about reinvesting the substantial capital we generate, it’s in higher growth areas fundamentally and you’re seeing that play out in areas of client demand, data analytics solutions, etc. I think, frankly, the exciting piece is net new opportunities across the system. And it’s that combination is what gives us confidence to say, kind of irrespective of kind of economic changes, we are committed to and excited about continuing to progress toward mid-single-digit or greater. And maybe, again – these are interesting maybe to top line, but if you kind of dig in a little bit, the example I gave on net new with Freddie and Fannie – maybe, Eric, talk a little bit about sort of how that played out. And that literally created net new capability in a net new marketplace for us.
Eric Andersen: Sure. Let me go a little bit deeper on the mortgage market then. As you said, we are working with our clients and capital providers to make a new market. What we did was we took unique data sets about the mortgage industry, its risk factors and then we played the role using our data and analytics capabilities to be the bridge that actually creates the risk construct that the insurers and reinsurers can put their capital against. It creates an alternative funding source for our clients and it creates a new risk pool that the insurers and reinsurers can invest. But the reality is, it all started with pulling the team together across reinsurance, across commercial risk and all the various capabilities using those cutting-edge analytics and structuring expertise to be able to build that new risk area. And it really is a new market.
Dave Styblo: Helpful, thanks.
Gregory Case: A very specific example in terms of sort of where we are. Again, this is such an important area, we want you to have confidence in our ability to kind of change the way we go to market and evolve that. ACT is another example that might be worth just talking about for a second in terms of sort of how that’s fundamentally different and how that’s involved.
Michael O'Connor: Sure. And you’re talking, Greg, about Aon Client Treaty. And for us, this is a groundbreaking solution and we’ve mentioned it before where we created new solution in Lloyd’s and 20% of any eligible order there. We can actually match capital there on best-in-class terms and conditions, pricing and follow-on claims. So, truly a distinctive client value proposition. That doesn’t come about without us being able to integrate the capabilities, the data and analytics and the propriety data that existed both in our commercial risk and in our reinsurance teams. And you bring those two teams together, then we had to do more. We actually went out and collected distinctive data on over 6,000 different risks. That’s exposure, loss information, risk attributes. And being able to bring that together, integrate it and actually digest it and then actually be able to present that to capital providers to our carrier partners, that’s how we got capacity behind the solution. And it’s been absolutely terrific for our clients. If we look back, it’s been in place for three years. And if you look at 2018 alone, we saw over 20% growth in the clients who took this solution up to use. And it allows us to fundamentally think about different solutions. So, we’re excited about continuing to use this to help clients. We are in the market today, binding risk. And I think, more broadly, for us, we step back and say, from that experience, from those capabilities, from the combination and integration of capabilities across commercial risk and reinsurance, we’re going to continue to work on bringing those capabilities to new markets and try to innovate with carrier providers to new solutions and new geographies.
Gregory Case: Not to pound it too much, Dave, but you get the idea. This is both market share gain, it’s portfolio mix and it’s these net new opportunities, and I think it’s worth exploring them in terms of sort of what it can mean for us. It’s not the be-all and end-all, but these net new areas are pretty exciting, pretty fundamental.
Dave Styblo: Helpful, thanks. Thanks for those examples.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Peters of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Greg Peters: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First, I was looking at the results in your data and analytics segment. And, obviously, strong organic in the fourth quarter. But for the year, only up 3%. I’m wondering if Inpoint is housed in that segment. And I’m just curious, of all the segments, that’s one area where I would anticipate growth would be accelerating and it doesn’t seem to have borne out at least for the full year.
Gregory Case: Yeah. Great question, Greg. Listen, we talked in the first couple of quarters about a challenge sort of in the first half to sort of influence the overall results for the year in the flood business and a contract that was transitioned and the recent – we actually exited that part of the overall business. That’s really influencing the numbers you are seeing. If you look at the last half of the year, and particularly the last quarter, you’re starting to see the momentum that’s there. Inpoint is, in fact, in this arena. By the way, in the back of the deck we posted this morning, it sort of breaks all that out. But the transition in the second half and what you’re seeing is really kind of where the power is. And there’s just a tremendous amount here. We are very, very optimistic about sort of the efforts in data analytics. And I would highlight again, data analytics for us, this is standalone data analytics that we sort of bring to the market, separate from what we do in the business. But in the business, there is a tremendous amount that goes on across the firm. And again, maybe picking on Mike and Eric for a second, not only do we have client examples, we just talked about Aon client treaties and what we did with Freddie and Fannie in the multifamily mortgage market, we also have fundamental platforms that are emerging here that are very different. And a couple come to mind. Maybe start with risk here just for a second in terms of sort of what that looks like as a platform in the future.
Michael O'Connor: Sure, Greg. And when we think about our health business and our commercial risk business, we’re really focused on institutionalizing data and analytics across our network. When we think about making that come to life every day, there’s two things that would have to happen. First is, we’ve got to capture global transactional level data and adjust that into our innovation centers. And we’ve been doing that for years and we think we have truly a distinctive data set on which we can draw upon to support our colleagues and support our clients. And the second part of that, as you highlighted is, we’ve got to build a platform that actually hosts the data and analytical tools we have and allows our colleagues to be able to access that data set in our innovation centers. And we’ve rolled out a solution for our health business, which is our total benefits solutions, and we’ve got one for our commercial risk business, which we call Risk/View. And if you just look at the progress we’re making and you look at 2018 as just one example and you take Risk/View as an example, we had over 6,000 active users as we exited 2018. And we view an active user as someone who is touching the data every day, who is actually using the tools we have available to solve client needs. We had over 100,000 different solutions actually provided to the clients through 2018. And when we think about the momentum we have in our colleagues and our clients using this platform, we are growing at almost 250%. So, we are excited about what we’re doing for clients and supporting our colleagues today. We’re even more excited about the future.
Eric Andersen: And just to pick up, Mike, I would say on the reinsurance solution line of the business, there is also a global platform that organizes all types of client data, reinsurer data, placement data, that actually provides our brokers with more insight and our clients with more insight to be able to make better choices between risk and capital. I would also say that information, tying back to the question around Inpoint, that information actually feeds and works with our Inpoint teams to provide the front-end business consulting that our clients are looking for around their own strategies to grow, to build into markets, etc. So, it really does all tie together.
Gregory Case: Again, Greg, back to your question, we are very, very excited, bullish on the solution line, how it evolves over time. Again, the one transaction I described sort of influences the results for the year. But we are very excited about the momentum going forward as you suggested.
Greg Peters: Thank you for those thoughtful answers. I’d be remiss if I didn’t try and get Christa into the conversation. The IRS issued a bunch of new regs towards the end of last year. And you had a very effective tax management strategy. I was wondering if you could update us on what your views on tax are on a consolidated basis for 2019 and 2020 in the context of the new regs that were issued?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg. I really appreciate you thinking of me. So, in terms of – obviously, in December 2017, US tax reform legislation was enacted. As we noted then, we expected additional clarifications as you described, Greg. And in November and December, in 2018, there were specific proposed regulations in five key areas – [indiscernible], anti-hybrid, interest deductibility, and foreign currency gains and losses on certain repatriated earnings. We are a UK-domiciled company. We do run a global capital pool. And as we look at the proposed regulatory changes, we feel good about where we are. We previously gave guidance of 18% for 2018. Given the impact of favorable discrete items, primarily in Q3 2018, the full-year 2018 tax rate was below 18%, coming in at 15.6%. As I look back historically, exclusive of the impact of the discrete items, which can be positive or negative, and really difficult to predict, our historical underlying rate over the last three years has been approximately 18%. And we’re not going to give guidance going forward. So, I hope that helps answer your questions, Greg.
Greg Peters: It does. I was wondering if you could just follow on with a comment around share repurchase and your views towards that versus investment in your business?
Christa Davies: Yeah. So, as we think about share repurchase, we start with a cash base of $1.45 billion. If you add the declining uses of cash between now and the end of next year of $620 million, you’ve really got a kind of $2.1 billion starting point before you grow operating income and working capital. So, huge cash generation capability. Plus increased debt as we think about restructuring expenses and pension coming down. So, good cash flow and opportunity for incremental debt. Then the use of cash, we really allocate on our return on capital basis. And share repurchase remains our highest return on capital opportunity across Aon, given the DCF valuation we have of Aon today, which values are substantially above where we’re trading.  Having said that, Greg, what I would say is, we have real opportunities to invest organically in the firm in a lot of data analytic capabilities, as you’ve heard describe from Mike and Eric and Greg today. And we’ve got a significant M&A pipeline. Actually, the biggest M&A pipeline we’ve had in our history. And so, we’ll continue to actively manage return on capital in terms of share repurchase versus M&A versus organic investment, and optimize those on a return on capital basis. And you can see the progress we’ve made on return on capital. The growth we’ve had in return on capital this year, 21.7%, which is our return on capital for 2018 is the highest we’ve had in Aon’s history. So, we are managing that very actively.
Greg Peters: Thank you for your answers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Mike Zaremski: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Just one question, but it has two parts. I was hoping you could offer some insights about what data points investors can think about to help size up the long-term growth opportunity for two business segments. The first is delegated investment solutions. For example, I’ve been asked many times by investors if that business growth opportunity is tied more to capital markets levels or perhaps you have a low level of market share and you’re using your relationships in the defined benefit space to grow. And the second area I was hoping you could offer some context is the overall data analytics services segments. Investors have asked me if that growth rate is most correlated with commercial property and casualty insurance demand. That’s my question. Thanks.
Christa Davies: Sure. Mike, I might take the delegated question and Greg will do data analytics. So, on delegated, it is one of our highest growth, highest margin, highest free cash flow opportunity across the firm. And you’ve seen us invest organically significantly in that business and inorganically in fantastic acquisitions, like Townsend, which is integrating really well into the firm and driving substantial opportunity for us going forward. As we think about the growth rate of that business, it’s absolutely a double-digit growth rate business. And the reason we say that, Greg, is because – sorry, Mike, is because we look at the opportunity for a whole bunch of clients who are currently managing this themselves. And they have two or three people managing their investments. They are substantially smaller in scale. If you think about the $150 billion of assets we have under management, and so we can really manage that opportunity much more effectively for them. We understand the liability side of that balance sheet already and we can match assets to get the pension outcomes for clients around pension expense, pension unfunded liability and pension cash contributions. And so, whether it’s the effectiveness of the return on assets we get because we have much greater scale and we can get them into better opportunities or whether it’s the asset plus liability matching to get the pension outcomes for clients, we see substantial opportunity for continued market share gains there. And we love that segment.
Gregory Case: And if you think about it, this is really fundamentally driven on the delegated side for a segment of clients out there, a large segment. We have a better solution. That solution actually works irrespective of kind of market conditions in terms of where it is. It’s actually a great thing to sort of see that evolve and it’s really been a terrific part of sort of what we’ve done over time. Coming to the data analytics piece, it’s really an important – again, back to how we see this growing over time. Your question around, is it connected to the commercial risk marketplace, in particular, and we would really encourage you to separate them. This is fundamentally content and capability that helps us work with our clients, to improve our operating performance, strengthen their balance sheet, reduce volatility in their business. Sometimes, we use insurance solutions. Sometimes we don’t. This is not about insurance. Not about the cycle. In fact, our firm becomes more and more separated from the cycle over time. We just look at our history and what we’ve been able to do. So, for us, the whole data and analytics effort, almost irrespective of the solution line it sort of moves into, and we talked about the applications of commercial risk, we’ve talked about the applications in reinsurance and how they came together in data analytics, it really cuts across all those solution lines. It’s equally true in health. It’s equally true in retirement investments. And maybe I’ll ask Eric to pick one example sort of on the retirement investment side since you raised it in terms of sort of that solution line. But data analytics is really an engine that actually enhances our existing businesses substantially, but also creates literally net new opportunity in terms of sort of what we could do in the marketplace. So, Eric, pick an example in retirement investment.
Eric Andersen: Sure. It’s almost a – it’s a great Aon United story as well. In reinsurance, there is a technology platform called ReMetrica that we use. It actually helps the insurers understand their capital requirements as they are underwriting business. That same system is useful to our investment consulting team as they try and build the right type of portfolio for the insurance company client base. So, it’s just a good example of where we are able to use existing capabilities to help other solution lines drive new capability and new client demand and new client satisfaction. So, there is a couple of them out there, but just to stick with that one, it’s just, I think, a great example.
Gregory Case: So, if you think about it, Mike, this is literally our investment consulting colleagues knowing their clients more and more over time, their challenges, their demands over time, looking across global Aon and seeing solutions that they can actually then apply sort of in their backyard. And then, what data analytics is really doing is really looking across the firm and pulling together our innovation centers, content and capability, A, we’ve never applied across the firm and, B, we never actually brought in additional content to supplement it. So, we’ve got an engine that literally kind of – and the idea of sort of what’s net new at Aon these days. A net new at Aon is the application of data analytics in an Aon United environment. Those are fundamentally different. And as we said before, that has applicability externally in the client stuff we talked about. And, ironically, also powerfully internally, and we talked about Aon business services and sort of how it played out there. So, that’s really for us the power of data analytics and why we talk about the data analytics solution line so much.
Mike Zaremski: That’s helpful. And I just had one follow-up on the same – on your answer. So, for the data and analytics services segment, would your competitors be the other large brokers or would these be other firms or how do you view your competitor set in that segment?
Gregory Case: Again, we certainly respect everybody who’s out there, traditional and non-traditional in every way, shape or form. Ours is really not to focus on them. The beauty in the evolution of this has really been about fundamental client need. What’s going on with our clients, what’s happening in terms of their performance. Overall income performance, balance sheet performance, volatility, what’s driving change in their business they are concerned about and what can we bring to bear. And that literally is what’s driven our data analytics engine. So, Aon Client Treaty, as Mike described, was driven out of the fact that clients came to us and said, we go to London and place our business and we create all these kinds of risk because the syndicates don’t actually always play together all the time, is there a way to actually think about, particularly the tail risk, the last 10% of the syndicates, and the answer is a data and analytics solution actually address that. And so, this is really driven out of client needs. You will see us – and we’re investing 400 million plus a year on content capability and data analytics. You will see us continue to drive that across our solution lines across the firm, and that really is the engine that we really want to try to get better and better at. Hold us accountable to the question of, how are you helping clients succeed through data analytics. That’s really what we want to address.
Mike Zaremski: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Adam Klauber: Good morning. Thanks. Can we talk a bit about alternative capital? Aon has been a leader of bringing alternative capital into the reinsurance business over the last number of years. I guess I’m interested in what’s new and what’s evolving. If you can just give us an example, what are maybe some of the newer structures you’re seeing in alternative capital, number one. Number two, are you seeing alternative capital more moving to primary markets? And overall, is that a business that continues to grow rapidly over the next three, five years?
Gregory Case: So maybe, Adam, I’ll start, but I think Eric and Mike can both provide really interesting color here. Look, our world is – people describe different categories of it. We don’t. We describe matching capital with risk to the extent our clients need it really across the board. And as you’ve highlighted, alternative capital sort of in the reinsurance world with $600 billion give or take in capital and close to kind of $100 million of it, give or take, sort of alternative capital, and I think Eric will describe, a pretty substantial increase sort of over time is important, here to stay, and important part of matching capital with risk. So, we see applicability on the reinsurance side continue to evolve and grow and on the primary side. But, maybe, Eric, thoughts on sort of overall direction of where you see this going.
Eric Andersen: Yeah. It’s a great question. I would say a couple of thoughts. One is, alternative capital is essentially just a different pool of capital, right? So, we call it alternative because it is an M&A from the insurance space, in particular. It is continuing to drive closer and closer to the original client risk as opposed to where it had started which is in the retrocessional market. It continues to be innovative. It continues to be creative to try and drive new solutions in areas where we have historically not been able to create client solutions sort of solving with existing capital basis, whether it’s in pandemic areas or other sort of large exposures. So, they're proven to be very good partners and thought partners to how to innovate. And I know just maybe looking over to Mike, the solutions that it is trying to drive into this market commercial risk market as it tries to get closer the front-end customers, certainly, something that we see continuing in the future.
Michael O'Connor: Sure. And Adam, what Eric was highlighting is exactly what we are seeing every day all around the world, which is that kind of capital is trying to get closer to the client and it’s looking at and starting to think about, can it be applied against emerging risks like cyber and IT and others, but also traditional risks. And I think one of the things we’ve done with some of the structural moves we’ve made internally at Aon is we’re better integrated today. We think about matching client need with capital, and that’s across insurance and reinsurance. And you will see us continue to try to find ways to innovate and find the right capital to meet our clients’ needs. An alternative capital will be part of the solution.
Adam Klauber: Thank you. And just to follow-up, does that revenue typically fall in the reinsurance brokerage or is that spread out depending on where the transaction happens?
Gregory Case: Really, at the end of the day, again, we’re matching capital with risk and it will show up where the transaction ends up happening. Again, what you’re hearing us describe, Adam, is more than just a transaction. There is advice wrapped around it. This is really more of a solution, part of a broader solution. Often, it ends up being a transaction as part of it, but it’s not the only piece. And one thing we would come back to is, remember, we’re talking about Aon United. We are talking about a single P&L. We want to spend less time about where the money goes and more time around have we helped the client or not. And so, for us, you’ll see it more in the early days M&A, sort of in the reinsurance solutions world, but, frankly, over time, it’s going to be across the firm.
Adam Klauber: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question, going back to some of our remarks, you guys have spoken of late about the goal of getting to this mid-single-digit organic growth or greater over the long-term. Now, if we can try to get some commentary to tie that back to how you see 2019 shaping up, obviously, you guys made the point of really strong 5% organic in 2018. So, how do you see your businesses running from a growth perspective in terms of – could we see an uplift from that 5% towards that long-term goal in 2019?
Gregory Case: Elyse, as we described, our objective, as we laid it out is mid-single-digit or greater over time. And so, you can calibrate mid-single-digit and calibrate – or greater. But we see achieving that. And what I described before a little bit was why are we – why is out there and why are we excited about the ability to achieve it. And we described kind of what we’ve done in market share gains, what we’ve done in the portfolio mix shift that Christa described – and don’t underestimate that. We are essentially putting capital in places and categories that are just fundamentally growing faster. That’s a big opportunity and a big tailwind for us. And then, this idea – and we’ve spent a little bit more time on the call today, we know, around a little more granularity on net new because anybody can say that. We are trying to give you some very specific examples of what that looks like. But if you think about these categories of net new, things like cyber, we cavalierly all talk about cyber, but it’s only a $3 billion to $4 billion premium market against the $460 billion connected insured loss in the US alone. Doesn’t include anything in Europe. Over time, with GDPR, the data protection laws in Europe, the entire connected cyber loss may approach $1 trillion and yet we are in the insurance marketplace at $3 billion to $4 billion in premium. Obviously, inadequate. So, for us, we see real opportunity in the global environment. Again, it’s not just market share gain and portfolio mix. It’s sort of the idea of net new. Mike talked about intellectual property and how that’s evolved over time. Fundamentally, 75% of the S&P 500 market cap is derived from intangible assets. That’s massively increased since 1975. So, fundamentally, we've got, we believe, opportunities out there because our clients have needs out there and they continue to go up over time. And the other piece that sort of ties into this for us is the whole idea sort of talent rewards and how that fits in in the overall equation because people, talent, is so fundamental to success for our clients over time. These things start to really tie together in the work we are doing in retirement investment and then talent really fits in in the equation and the work we’re doing in health fits in into the equation. Again, not just to pile on, but if you think about some of the work we’re doing in health and retirement investment, we’ve said before on these calls, there is a fundamental truth in the world, which is our clients’ employees are overspending on health and underspending on retirement. And it really is tragic when you think about it, sort of the impact over the life of a family. If we can modify that by 1% or 2%, have them be smarter about how they think about their health spend and smarter about how they think about the retirement spend, we've actually impacted a family over a 10 or 20-year period. Pretty cool stuff. And so, for us, we look at the world and say, my God, there is so much demand out there that we need to understand better and then be able to effectively address. And in doing so, that’s what brings us back to kind of mid-single-digit or greater. Again, it’s all easy to say. What you’ve seen over the last few years is progress, 3%, 3%, 4%, 4%, 5% and we feel good about progress in 2019 and 2020 and 2021.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And then, my next question is on the margin outlook. So, you guys saw about 60 basis points of core margin expansion kind of away from the saves during the year during 2018. Is that about the right level that you would envision in 2019 or are there some headwinds or tailwinds that might drive that either higher or lower this coming year?
Christa Davies: The first thing I’d say, Elyse, is as we think about total margin expansion for 2018, it’s 220 basis points. So, substantial margin expansion. Included in the 60 basis points of core margin expansion for the year, we are absorbing investments we’re making in future growth. The core margin expansion is really higher than the 60, if you know what I mean, because you are absorbing the investments. And so, as you think about our margin expansion over the last 10 years, we've on average increased margins by 70 basis points to 80 basis points each year for the last 10 years. We are not giving specific guidance on margin expansion going forward, but we did say that there are really three big drivers of margin expansion going forward. The first is accelerating top line revenue growth as we just talked about, mid-single-digit or greater. The second is the portfolio mix shift towards higher revenue growth, higher margin businesses. And the third is the operating leverage from the productivity we’re getting from the Aon United operating model. So, we do have real confidence in margin expansion over 2019, 2020 and 2021.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And then, my last question, in terms of free cash flow with the restructuring charges lower in 2019 than 2018, I know that double-digit growth is a long-term target. But I would envision, given that tailwind to free cash flow, that you would expect to hit the double-digit growth in 2019 or is there something I’m missing when thinking about that?
Christa Davies: Again, the double-digit free cash flow growth is a long-term target. We are not giving cash flow guidance for 2019. If you start with a $1.45 billion of cash in 2018, we are going to, just through reduction in use of cash, free up $620 million by the end of next year. And then, you add on top of that, Elyse, operating income growth, working capital and additional debt, and so you’ve got significant financial flexibility. And then, we will use return on invested capital to drive allocation, with buyback being the highest return on capital across the firm.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you very much for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Kai Pan: Thank you and good morning. So, I want to focus on the commercial risk. The organic growth, 4%, for the quarter is lower than previous two quarters, but for the full year, you still achieved like 6%. Is that because the year-on-year comparison is tougher than the prior quarters? And then stepping back, can you just comment on general pricing environment as well as the exposure growth, in particular in the lending market.
Gregory Case: Yeah. Kai, thanks for the question. Listen, if we think about overall progress – and really, this cuts across the firm. Again, we posted 5% across the firm which is the highest since 2006. We feel good about that momentum. We feel very good about the continued momentum on the commercial risk side. And I’ll add a couple of things sort of I want to just align you too, if I could. One is, first of all, as we said before, this isn’t about quarter-to-quarter. It’s kind of about year-to-year in terms of progress. Now, if you look at commercial risk, I think we do 6% in 2018 and 2% in 2017. So, you should sort of think about the overall momentum, feeling pretty good about sort of where that is. We did have an exceptionally strong fourth quarter in 2017. And on top of that strong comp, another strong quarter in Q4 of 2018. And we highlighted a number of different places where that emanated from. So, this is exceptional, exceptional performance and leadership on behalf of our Aon colleagues around the world. And the second piece I would just highlight, as you think about sort of what drives this going forward, this is not about pricing, as we’ve talked about before. We’d really encourage you not to sort of connect us to pricing per se. This is really, if you want to, market impact overall, which is a function of insured values and pricing. And insured value is actually a more impact in terms of sort of what’s going on in the context of this.  And then, again, as you think about growth, remember, we are talking about taking share which we’ve been doing. Also, when we describe kind of investing in areas, higher growth, higher margin, that’s in the commercial risk arena. A number of different examples in that, as we’ve talked about before. And then, this idea of net new and how that plays out. So, we feel very good about the momentum in commercial risk and feel like the performance of the year really demonstrated that.
Kai Pan: Any change in the London market?
Gregory Case: Say a little bit more. What are you thinking about the London market? What are you concerned about?
Kai Pan: No, just there was a review about the facility in the London market. I just wonder is there – and also, you saw quite a big change in the Lloyd’s market in terms of both pricing and some syndicates pulling out capacities. So, what kind of role does Aon play here and where do you see opportunities?
Gregory Case: Yeah. So, for us, again, remember, our world is matching capital with risk. In the context of matching capital with risk, Lloyd’s happens to be one piece of that. It’s actually, on a relative basis, against institutions we work with around the world, relatively smaller. And then, in the context of that, as it relates to the review I think you’re describing, you’re talking about – the level of revenue we have in that is very, very – it’s a fraction, $50 million or less. It’s a fraction of our global revenue. So, that’s not obviously going to be a major impact either way. For us, it is how we work with Lloyd’s to see them strengthen over time and be better able and capable of serving our clients. So, in that sense, we are matching capital with risk and Lloyd’s will play out over time. But I wouldn’t over focus on that sort of in the context of sort of what we’re doing in commercial risk.
Kai Pan: Okay. This was very clear. Then, Christa, you mentioned your M&A pipeline is very strong. So, what would be your preference? Are you looking more in the traditional brokerage areas or in this new emerging areas you’re looking for higher growth?
Christa Davies: Yeah. Kai, if you look at the M&A we’ve done over the last couple of years, that’s probably the best example of what we’re going to do in the next couple of years. And we’ve really done a huge amount of work on a return on capital basis to identify the highest revenue growth, highest margin, highest free cash flow opportunity areas. And there’s things like health and elective benefits, our affinity area, delegated investment management, data analytics and, of course, you can see some brokerage areas because they are very important to our business. But what we are continuing to focus on is higher revenue growth, higher margin, higher return on capital opportunity areas.
Kai Pan: Okay, great. Last one, if I may. I’m just curious, because you mentioned a lot of examples of collaboration among your colleagues, how are they incentivized including compensation to drive that best behavior?
Gregory Case: So, one of the things, Kai, you come back to, and this is sort of more than compensation, it’s the heart of Aon United and the work we’ve done over the last decade to bring our firm together. And you ask a fundamental question. If we work more effectively together, are we serving clients more effectively? Are we winning more? Yes or no? Are we doing more with clients? Yes or no? Are we able to understand them better in a way in which we can actually bring them net new solutions they haven’t seen before? When was the last time we wowed her client? That is the energy that underpins Aon United. That either works or it doesn’t. If it works, it’s incredible. And we can scale and drive it around it firm and that’s hard to duplicate. If it doesn’t, then you’re kind of back to what have you done for me lately as a personal sort of mission. And that’s not our focus. That’s not what we are trying to do. And so, we’ve taken a number of steps to reinforce the power of what I just described certainly with compensation. Our top 200 leaders, 65% of their bonus, for example, is tied on overall performance. What we do from a long-term compensation standpoint is truly tied around performance of the firm and performance shares of the firm. So, we’ve done a number of things on comp, but we wouldn't want you to take away from this, this is a trick and a comp plan. This is an absolute maniacal focus around how we can help clients be more effective. And it turns out, working together, Aon United is a fundamental lever, weapon in terms of being able to do that and that’s what driving the energy here. And that’s why it’s taken a while to do this, right? This builds over time, builds momentum over time. We are starting to see it play out more and more effectively, but that’s really the energy behind it. And, of course, alignment with comp along the way.
Kai Pan: Thank you so much for all the insight and good luck in 2019.
Gregory Case: Thank you very much, Kai.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Yaron Kinar: Hi, good morning. Two questions. So, first, on platform investments that are fueling future growth, I’m assuming that you took advantage of the economic and then P&C rate tailwinds to accelerate some of that growth in 2018. Is that correct? And if so, would you slow platform investments if these tailwinds dissipate or would you need to continue to invest at this level in order to achieve the long-term growth targets?
Christa Davies: Yaron, one of the things I would say is, as you look at the restructuring program, the core of the restructuring program for us is investing in the Aon United operating model. It’s allowing us to actually bring the firm together. We used to have two segments, risk solutions and HR solutions. We now have one segment called Aon. And we are bringing together the operations of Aon under an Aon United banner and we’ve invested substantially in Aon level platforms, as Mike O’Connor described, with the call center example, but equally on the platform examples we’ve said. And so, a lot of what you’ve seen in the restructuring program has been investments in platforms and bringing together disparate capabilities that used to be in each of the solution lines into one Aon platform. So, that’s absolutely what we’ve been doing in 2017, 2018 and now 2019. And it is forming the foundation for accelerated revenue growth in the coming years.
Gregory Case: Maybe on top of that, Yaron, I’m just going to – I want to make sure – I might have read between the lines a little bit on what you described. But I think you said, given the P&C year, we had more to invest and will that change over time. I do want to come back and just fully build on Christa’s point and disconnect that. We were making 400-plus-million dollar investments in content capability for the last number of years. And our firm is not the cycle, right? It is really not the pricing cycle at all. Our view is we are more and more disconnected from that and we are more connected to how we are helping clients improve their business and succeed in their business. And so, our investment in the platforms that Mike and Eric described, we are seeing real benefit from, and we’re going to continue to drive that. And the beauty of it is, to Christa’s point, we fully have the capacity to do that, irrespective of whatever happens on the pricing side because, as I said before, it’s much more around market impact, insured values than it is about pricing. So, hopefully, you’re comfortable. So, that level of investment, we’re going to continue to make. And again, the check on that investment is return on invested capital. If it helps client succeed, we win more clients. We get a return on the capital. We invest more. That cycle is literally that discipline, is what we’ve got set up as we drive these platform investments in data analytics.
Yaron Kinar: That’s helpful. And my second question, you’ve talked about targeting growth in high-margin businesses with a strong growth profile. Do you also consider the cyclical or non-cyclical profile of these businesses as you’re constructing the portfolio? Maybe can you give us some examples of how you're trying that portfolio from a cyclical perspective?
Gregory Case: Again, we’ve come back to less about trying to do timing and really more around client need, right? This is fundamentally, what are we trying to get accomplished on behalf of clients. So, I come back to what is intellectual property. It doesn’t exist at this point in time. Clients don’t really understand sort of what’s possible. So, the investment we are making there are really trying to help them understand what is their intangible asset based worth, how is it evolving over time, and how are we going to protect that. We see long-term potential that’s substantial. By the way, that’s going to be true regardless of the cycle. And so, for us, this isn’t about trying to time it. It’s basically, fundamentally, what helps clients improve operating performance, strengthen balance sheet, reduce volatility. And more and more of our clients are really trying to understand the cost of volatility and how they factored in their overall performance. And so, for us, it’s about that long-term impact and that’s what’s driving our investment. And again, what I would highlight is, the beauty of this is, this doesn’t have to be a short-term agenda. This is, over time, what are we going to accomplish. And in the context of still doing that, you see us produce the results we just laid down for 2018, which was substantial margin improvement and substantial growth.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Paul Newsome: Good morning. My first question is, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the old rule of thumb of the relationship between margin and organic growth. The thought is that, you need to have 3% or better margin – or organic growth in a typical brokerage operation to get margin expansion. I was wondering if that relationship in your view is changing with the new Aon.
Christa Davies: So, the first thing I’d say is, we understand where that comes from because you basically said the largest expense base we have is people and you have 2% or maybe 3% inflationary push on your people expense base. One of the things we would say is, as we look at the investments we’re making in the Aon operating model and we are driving from productivity, we are increasingly able to get margin expansion at lower levels of growth. And I would note that we’ve been expanding margins for 10-plus years at all levels of growth. And the best example of that is, in 2008 and 2009, in the midst of an economic recession, we reported minus 1% revenue growth and expanded margins 260 basis points over those two years, 2008 and 2009. And so, I’m not sure actually for the last 12 years for us that there has been that relationship in place at all.
Gregory Case: And I would just add to that. Think about Aon. Aon again, just as we’ve sort of pushed – don’t confuse what we do with the insurance pricing, just completely disconnected. This is not about just pure commercial risk. The power of retirement investments and what we do there and how that’s evolved over time, what we’ve done in delegated, very, very powerful. The power of what we have in the health solutions area, really exceptional and growing, big opportunity over time. What you see us doing in commercial risk and reinsurance solutions is not only in their categories, but, as Eric and Mike described, they are cutting across all of the categories. So, for us, this creates real operating leverage in the business and we are, as we said before, committed to improved performance. And you've seen us, as Christa described, able to do it year-in and year-out.
Paul Newsome: Great. And my follow-up question is on M&A. Kind of a follow-up to M&A, earlier questions. Last night, AJ Gallagher had some data that suggests they had the smaller end of the market. Valuations for acquisitions have gone up quite a bit, going from sort of 6 to 8 times EBITDA to sort of 8 to 8.5 times EBITDA. My question is, is that relationship similar in the types of markets that you’re looking at? I realize they’re not necessarily the same always. But do you think a similar dynamic is happening with the overall market that you’re looking at?
Christa Davies: Paul, I think you’re raising a very good point. We are actually, I think, in some quite different areas in terms of our M&A platform. We are very much focused on content and capability and we’re approaching this from a return on capital perspective. As we look at our M&A pipeline, it is 100% aligned with the highest revenue growth, highest margin, highest return on capital opportunity areas across our entire portfolio. And our general approach is to really map out, on a return on capital segment, high return on capital segments, what are the companies that are most attractive, get to know them early, and then really build the relationship to understand and make sure that the cultural integration will work. And we’ve been successful on that. We’ve actually brought in some amazing content and capability, whether that’s the [indiscernible] that Greg described with intellectual property or it’s the Townsend team in delegated or it’s [indiscernible] capability in cyber, it’s been absolutely phenomenal. And so, for us, it’s much more focused on content and capability and return on capital. And we’re seeing very attractive returns on capital outcomes from our M&A portfolio.
Paul Newsome: Great. Congratulations on the quarter.
Christa Davies: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. One short-term and one long-term question. The short-term question is that we are clearly seeing, I think, a better focus on pricing discipline at Lloyd’s, and Kai mentioned this. But I’m wondering if you could talk about the opportunities and risks as Lloyd’s starts to focus on its unsustainable expense ratio?
Gregory Case: So, one of the things that we've – again, we’ve come back to concept. We are matching capital with risk. Lloyd’s is a source of capital. We love to see them continue to innovate, get better, bring new solutions, new ideas, new perspectives. A lot of capital out there, right? $3.5 trillion. Lloyd’s is a fraction of that. So, we want to see them win that game. We want to see them sort of effective in that game. We want to see them become more efficient, more effective, all the things that come with that. But there’s many, many, many solutions out there that we access on behalf of our clients. By the way, just for reference again, $3.5 trillion sort of represents all the balance sheets of the insurance companies added up. The world that we play in in retirement investments on the pension side touches $31 trillion, of which a fraction has sort of come into the insurance world, the $100 billion that Eric talked about before. And so, net-net, it really looks like how Lloyd’s is going to evolve over time. So, for us, we’re going to be supportive of our market partners as always. But for us, we’re not too concerned about sort of evolution. We have high expectations for them and want to support them. But we’re very comfortable we can bring client solutions that involve capital.
Michael O'Connor: Greg, just to pick up on that, I think certainly Lloyd’s is getting a lot of attention and a lot of coverage in terms of its move towards creating more profitable underwriting platforms through the syndicate. I think it’s also worth noting, and maybe not as well covered, that insurers all over the world and looking at their bottom 10% of their portfolios and trying to reposition their business. It’s just not as well publicized. But, certainly, that move is going on everywhere where people are looking at business, where they're not getting an adequate rate of return, and either raising price, changing terms or exiting the solution line.
Gregory Case: Great point.
Meyer Shields: That’s helpful. Thank you so much. And then, longer term, I think this is a question for Christa, does the ratio of investment spend to revenues change? Does it decline over time?
Christa Davies: Sorry. Can you just say more about the question, Meyer?
Meyer Shields: Yeah. I’m just wondering whether – as we look forward, I don’t know, three, five years, and revenues grow organically through acquisitions, does the required level of future-focused growth spend, does that decline relative to higher absolute base of revenues?
Christa Davies: Look, I guess, I would answer it based on return on capital, Meyer. What I would say is, as you think about the investments we’re making, a lot of them are scalable, which I think is the point you’re really getting towards. So, if you think about data analytics, for example, we’ve invested $400 million a year for the last 10 years in data analytics. And so, there is absolute scale in that platform and series of investments. And you can see that because our return on invested capital is at 21.7%. It grew, I think, 370 basis points or 380 basis points year-over-year. And it’s the highest it’s ever been. And so, we continue to manage return on capital to get to these outcomes. And is there operating leverage in our business model? For sure, there is.
Meyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. And just, maybe near term, can you give us a sense as to the maximum level of debt that you will be comfortable with?
Christa Davies: Yeah. So, as we think about leverage, we really think about our investment grade rating. It’s incredibly important to us for financial flexibility purposes and as we sell into global, large corporates. And we are committed to our current investment grade rating. As we think about debt to EBITDA, it’s really 2 to 2.5 times on a GAAP basis, which is really 3 to 3.5 times on a Moody’s basis. And as restructuring charges decrease and pension contributions decrease, you can expect us to add debt 1 for 1 to keep the debt to EBITDA ratio the same. And as I mentioned in my opening script, we do have opportunities to increase debt over the coming years, as you see those uses of cash decline, particularly over the next two years.
Meyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. Thank you so much.
Operator: And the next question is from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.
Ryan Tunis: Hey, thanks for the question. So, I guess, what I’m trying to get comfortable with, the growth story here is, clearly, great. Better organic growth than any of the big brokers last year, also phenomenal. But there’s an awful lot of cash being spent on this restructuring. I’m just trying to get comfortable that that number actually does go down substantially in 2020. And in particular, I’m trying to understand what exactly is in that – the other associated cost pocket for restructuring costs.
Christa Davies: Sure. So, Ryan, certainly, I can say that the restructuring program finishes at the end of 2019. And as we think about the $1.35 billion of total cash generating $500 million of annual return, we think that’s a terrific return on capital for shareholders. And so, we’re really excited about the program and we’re very confident about delivering the $500 million dollars in savings this year and, more importantly, having productivity flow through in 2019 and 2020 and 2021, which will drive improved operating leverage in future years. As we think about the other bucket, your question, there is really kind of three things in there. The first is the separation costs related to our outsourcing business, which was obviously substantial as you're dividing Aon and a substantial portion of our business. The second was termination of contracts as, again, you're splitting Aon and our outsourcing business. And the third is professional services to actually execute the restructuring program. And so, again, we feel really good about the return on capital of the overall program and confident about delivering the savings and improve productivity going forward.
Gregory Case: Remember, Ryan, we undertook this restructuring. This is not your average vanilla restructuring to sort of take out costs. This is really – when we sold the outsourcing business, it was a chance to look at our firm in a fundamentally different way. This is net new news for us. And so, Aon business serves as – really does sort of take a look at our firm, all the restructuring goes through this perspective, really top down. And, really, this is kind of the non-salary, incentive and benefit cost we can look at differently, 2.5-plus-billion dollars in sort of spend. And this is fundamentally what we’re able to look at in technology, in real estate. Go to our New York office, for example, sort of footprint. It’s very, very different. Much more open, much more client focused and client centric. Much more technology capability. You’ll see that around the world. So, for us, this was an opportunity to strengthen the firm through the restructuring. And as Mike talked about before, it’s showing up in terms of quality in what we do with our clients in the marketplace. But also, rest assured, in cost saves and efficiency, that had to meet the return on invested capital test that we do with everything else. And so, we feel good about the return and, most important, feel good about what it might and will mean for Aon going forward.
Ryan Tunis: Understood. I was just trying to get a feel for why that number has been creeping up relative to the original estimate because there’s separation costs associated with the admin deal where I thought you would have known that earlier on.
Christa Davies: So, I guess, what I would say overall, Ryan, as we finalize the program going into 2019, we've added some additional projects which have a terrific return on capital. And, therefore, we increased the total program estimates – $1.35 billion in cash and $500 million in savings. And again, the return on capital, we think, is terrific.
Ryan Tunis: All right. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory Case: Just want to say thanks very much to everybody for joining the call and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.

Gregory Case: Thanks, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. In addition, we are excited to have our Co-Presidents, Eric Andersen and Mike O'Connor, join the call today. As highlighted last quarter, we intend to use our time on the call to provide you with more insight into the longer term view for the firm, with greater transparency into strategic initiatives. Also, like last quarter, we posted our detailed financial presentation on our website. We believe this approach provides a more thoughtful, long-term focus towards operational performance, including examples of investment in growth areas that are strengthening our capability to serve clients. Mike and Eric will be great additions to this discussion to give you another perspective on the power of leading Aon United. With that opening, we'd like to start by noting that our colleagues around the world delivered another strong result for the third quarter, with positive performance across each of our key metrics, including: 6% organic revenue growth; 190 basis points of margin expansion; 18% operating income growth; and 34% growth in EPS; and a similar strong performance across our key metrics year-to-date, reinforcing our continued long-term momentum, which Christa will discuss a little bit more in a bit. This continued momentum is a direct result of the strategic actions we've progressively taken to build upon the idea of leading Aon United and the impact it's having at scale on our business. As discussed last quarter, we've been laying the foundation for Aon United for over a decade, evolving our portfolio, investing in new content and capability and aligning client demand through programs like Aon Client Promise, all focused on increasing our relevance and strengthening our ability to deliver value for clients. More recently, over the last few quarters, we've taken steps to further reinforce and amplify this progress. In doing so, we've truly entered the era of Aon United, through structural changes that break down barriers and make it easier to deliver the best of the firm to clients: a single leadership team; a single P&L; a single brand; a single operating model. Most compelling, a united global professional services firm. Just last week, we announced another reinforcing step in this journey: The formation of our New Ventures Group, a team of leaders from across the firm who've created additional capacity to build on our already industry-leading record in innovation and further accelerate new sources of value for clients, led by Tony Goland as Chief Innovation Officer. The benefits that accrue when our global firm effectively works together are distinctive and unmatched in the industry and are unlocking significant value for our clients through greater innovation and superior, tailor-made solutions that fit their specific business objectives. Let me give you 2 quick examples. The first is an example of how our strategic investment in client-serving capabilities led to connections across solution lines and geographies in our core business that created unique client value. And the second is an example of how we're expanding the marketplace by attacking new business challenges on behalf of our clients. The first example. I was recently with one of our enterprise client leaders, which is a team of business advisers that coordinates Aon's value proposition for a select group of significant clients and a large private equity client. And we were discussing the needs of their portfolio companies. And in doing so, it became clearer that they wanted to put their balance sheet to work in new ways and that they aspired to create value outside of traditional PE opportunities. Our enterprise client leader connected that aspiration to our pension de-risking capabilities, and we began a conversation about the opportunity to apply their capital to help de-risk the pension obligations of their portfolio companies and potentially, beyond that, in the broader marketplace. By doing so, we expanded the conversation from risk mitigation to value creation. This is likely to be a new source of value for the client over the coming years and was made possible by the connection our enterprise client leader made between our commercial risk solutions capabilities and related offerings in Retirement Solutions. This example also demonstrates how the enterprise client group could help us create a templated approach to value creation and that we can replicate across sectors. And more broadly, how that, that team is helping us institutionalize our approach to Aon United growth opportunities and developing best practices designed to make it easier for all of our client-facing colleagues to bring the best of our firm to clients. This second example is all about marketplace expansion, as we continue our focus on expanding the marketplace by developing solutions to our clients' most pressing business needs. In Q3, we continued to invest behind cyber, with the launch of our silent cyber solution, driven by analytics and backed by an evolving reinsurance solution to help carriers respond to expanding cyber risk and regulations. Our actions are translating into accelerated revenue growth. Aon United equals growth, which you can see from both the quarter and the year-to-date in 2018 versus 2017. More important, it'll be driving -- a driving factor toward delivering on our goal of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth or greater over the long term as we expand the market, shift towards faster-growing areas of client demand and continue to increase market share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Christa for our thoughts on our progress year-to-date and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and welcome, everyone. As Greg described, the steps we're taking to lead Aon United drove another strong performance for the third quarter. I would note that our progress year-to-date continues to reinforce both our short- and long-term financial targets. Our performance year-to-date through the third quarter reflects: organic revenue growth of 4%; an acceleration from 3% year-to-date in 2017. In addition to accelerating organic growth, M&A is continuing to contribute, both improving the mix and driving total revenue growth of 10% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margins increased 210 basis points year-to-date and acceleration from our historic average of 70 to 80 basis points a year over the last decade. Accelerating revenue, combined with significant margin expansion, is delivering strong operating income growth of 19% year-to-date, with core operating income growth reflecting 10% or more than half of the year-over-year performance. Core margin expansion year-to-date is up 50 basis points, and I would note this includes the absorption of near-term investments in client-facing capabilities to support the Aon United growth initiatives that Greg highlighted. EPS growth of 29% year-to-date, placing us firmly on track to exceed our short-term target of $7.97 in EPS in 2018. And lastly, reported free cash flow increased substantially, reminding you that the prior year included cash tax payments related to the divestiture. Strong operational performance contributed to year-over-year growth, partially offset by increased restructuring outflows reflecting this is expected to be our peak year of restructuring cash usage. Adjusting for the impacts of the divestiture, underlying free cash flow grew 5% year-over-year, including a discretionary strategic decision to pull forward $80 million of pension contributions into the third quarter. Our continued momentum and long-term outlook are amplified by the investments we're making across the portfolio to support Aon United growth objectives of mid-single digit organic revenue growth or greater over the long term, and in our Aon United operating model to drive ongoing productivity improvements. As Greg discussed, we're investing organically and inorganically, in both talent and in capabilities across the portfolio in the highest return on invested capital opportunities, which are often driven by areas of client demand, where we find new ways to add value or more effectively service clients' unique business needs. One example is the operating leverage we're creating in our Affinity business, by designing and building an application that will create a differentiated solution for small businesses who prefer digital channels to help navigate their buying process. Through the creation of our next- generation global business services model, we're creating greater scalability, productivity and operating leverage, including the continued expansion of captive and outsourced service delivery centers, which will contribute to the substantial cost reduction. This is just one example of productivity improvements from our single operating model that will continue beyond the near-term restructuring program. Ongoing productivity improvements, combined with accelerating revenue growth and a portfolio mix shift to higher-margin businesses, are expected to drive continued long-term core margin expansion. More importantly, an accelerating growth profile, increased operating leverage and continued progress on working capital initiatives gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of double-digit annual growth in free cash flow over the long term. As I mentioned before, 2018 is expected to be the peak year of cash usage related to the restructuring initiative. Declining uses of cash for restructuring, CapEx and pension are expected to free up $650 million of free cash flow by the end of 2020, significantly increasing our capital flexibility to invest in value creation opportunities. With an expectation of strong free cash flow growth, combined with an opportunity for substantial additional leverage in 2019 and 2020, we're diligent about maximizing return on invested capital and make all capital allocation on this basis. This is highlighted by the $1.25 billion of share repurchase year-to-date, which remains the highest return on capital investment given our free cash flow valuation. In summary, we continue to accelerate revenue growth through significant investments in client-facing colleagues and capabilities to deliver Aon United, and we're driving substantial free cash flow generation that's expected to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg.
Gregory Case: Thanks, Christa. As mentioned earlier, we are glad to have Mike and Eric join us on the call to help provide further insight into how Aon United creates value for our clients and drives growth for the firm. Now going back to questions from our Q2 call, several questions revolved around the very topic, around creating value day-to-day. And today, we want to pick up on that line of questions from the last call and kick off today's discussion with a perspective from both Mike and Eric on this topic. However, before we turn to that question, I'm going briefly talk about each of these leaders and their importance to our firm. Eric has spent over 20 years at Aon and in that time, he's led and contributed to virtually every part of our business: he's held regional leadership roles in our commercial risk and health businesses; he's taken on the global leadership role in Reinsurance Solutions; he's most recently added Retirement Solutions, working with our colleagues to create connections between our insurance clients and our Investment Solutions. And of course, all those solutions are incubators for some of the most innovative uses of data and analytics. So he's had the opportunity to support this portfolio and understand the power of the insights we deliver to clients through data and analytics. Eric is also very well-known and trusted by our market partners. And perhaps most important, Eric's been in the ring as Aon has evolved over the years and has a unique appreciation for the importance and potential of our Aon United growth strategy. Mike has been with Aon for over a decade. His background in client service, coupled with excellent operational leadership, provides unique perspective on how we develop and commercialize insight and most effectively connect it to client need. Like Eric, Mike has held a broad range of leadership roles at Aon, most recently as CEO of our Commercial Risk Solutions, Health Solutions and Affinity Businesses. In that role, Mike championed an M&A agenda that has seen us build new capabilities related to emerging risks like cyber, intellectual property, both of which are consistent with our commitment to create new sources of value for clients. It's also worth noting that Mike spent a great deal of time in London working out of our global headquarters, which provided him more global perspective on the firm and a more nuanced understanding of the Lloyd's marketplace, and that's important to our clients. Now back to the question on Aon United and its impact at the front line of our firm. Eric, can I ask you to take the first cut at addressing that, and Mike, you can follow on.
Eric Andersen: Thanks, Greg. It's a privilege to be here with you and Christa, and thank you for the great question. Before I begin, I just want to echo Greg's comments on Mike and tell you how excited we are to be working together. As Greg referenced, we've known each other and worked together closely for over a decade, and that collaboration has been a great foundation and is really the spirit of Aon United. So on the Aon United question, where to begin? This is just something that has become so fundamental to the success of our firm. When I talk about the unique benefits of Aon United with our clients, I always start with our colleagues because that's really where the value originates. Our colleagues are incredibly engaged by the potential of Aon United. They have seen us systematically bring down the structural barriers over the last few years, and they have leapt at the opportunity to work closely together for clients. They were always inclined to work together, but sometimes we made it more difficult than it needed to be. By making it easier for them to bring the best of the firm to our clients, we have helped them create deeper, more meaningful relationships. And that's a good thing because ultimately, we're getting paid for value. And Aon United makes it easier to deliver more value for clients. In return, that strengthens our financial performance, with greater retention in our core business and increased relevance with clients through advice and solutions. Let me give you an example. If you look at our Reinsurance Solutions business, you'll find that we serve many of the largest insurers in the world. Historically, that was more of a transactional relationship. We were there to support their book of business. But over the last decade, you've seen us become more advice-driven, using data and analytics to better understand our underwriting appetites and more efficiently transfer the risks they were assuming to the secondary market. That success builds loyalty and intimacy. Those CEOs know that we understand their business better than any other type of partner they have. So as we built our investment consulting business, we've earned the right to introduce that new capability to an installed base of clients that already trust us and are conditioned to accept new insights. With 1 client in particular, we had a great relationship in the traditional reinsurance area supporting their book of business. With our investment consulting capability, we were able to help them on the asset side of their balance sheet. Being able to partner with this client across their business, we were able to take our relationship to an entirely new level of interaction where we improved operating performance and strengthened their balance sheet. That's just one example of the depth of our expertise in 1 solution line and our colleagues' understanding and belief in Aon United that translated into an opportunity to introduce a new capability to our clients in a manner that created unique value for them and drove growth for our firm. Mike, I know you see Aon United in action every day and have a few additional examples.
Michael O'Connor: Thanks, Eric. Listening to your description, well, I complete -- I agree completely that Aon United excites our colleagues, and we see that ultimately leading to greater client loyalty and growth. Let me take a moment and describe another example connected to the transportation sector that really reinforces this benefit. Across many geographies today, there's enormous growth around small trucks and fleets being put to work to complete the last mile of delivery. We see demand both from large clients and middle-market clients. However, the growth of these transportation businesses are challenged as there is need for more efficient and effective insurance solutions, both vehicle insurance and health and benefits solutions for their workforce. This client need has spurred within our team a truly Aon United response. Our team stepped back and brought together an array of capabilities: Industry expertise from our transportation logistics practice; operational and platform capabilities from our Affinity business that serves small businesses and consumers; reinsurance expertise to access and support capital providers; our captive team can assist clients that desire self-insured solution. We brought data and analytics expertise from our global risk consulting team for the vehicle solutions and our talent practice that can help assess driver performance. And lastly, health and voluntary benefit solutions for this gig economy workforce from our health practice. The integration of talent and capabilities from across the firm, which does not come together without an Aon United approach, allows us to deliver a customized solution to clients that enables them to operate and grow their business. This delivers an obvious benefit to a client, but these types of opportunities also is what excites our colleagues. They are incredibly engaged and motivated when working across solution lines and geographies to join forces to deliver unique value to clients. And that's been a big part of our journey towards becoming a professional services firm. Eric and I are seeing more and more Aon United efforts across the firm, similar to the transportation example I just shared, where colleagues are working together to create custom solutions, underpinned by insights from data and analytics that increase our relevance with clients and earn the right to provide advice and solution to our clients that help them grow, improve profitability and reduce risk.
Gregory Case: Thanks, Mike and Eric. I appreciate those examples of Aon United has generated impact with both clients and colleagues. Really helpful insight as we work to make -- make it easier really for our colleagues to bring the best of Aon to clients and help us deliver on the growth potential of our firm. And obviously, we can go on with a lot more examples, but let's see what's on the minds of everyone else. And operator, please open up the lines for our next question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Dave Styblo [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: I wanted to maybe continue the conversation with Mike and Eric. And Aon is in a, obviously a very good position financially, the cash flow is strong, going to get better. You've laid out $650 million of incremental savings that you'll get over the next couple of years. You've got more restructuring savings that will be coming through. I guess, as business leaders, how do you, Mike and Eric, see that flexibility being able to benefit the business in terms of investments that you'd make? What are things that you'd like to do that would either enable you to improve retention, improve organic growth, improve margins through your lenses.
Gregory Case: So Dave, it's Greg. And I'll start and then sort of -- we'll flip back and forth here as sort of we interact. First, really appreciate the question. You are really underpinning one of the strengths of the firm, so not only with the financial flexibility and capability, but really have an opportunity to look at client need and the evolution of client need and how it's changing and then react to that. So you've seen us make investments sort of on the acquisition side with Stroz in cyber, across-the-board with Townsend, sort of on the delegated side in exceptional ways. You've seen us make acquisitions with Admix in health and data analytics and ACT and in mortgage and the exchanges, et cetera. So we got a whole pallet of things we could look out across the firm to improve performance, both from an acquisition standpoint and organic standpoint. And I think Eric and Mike have really been at the helm of sort of how we've directed that and how we've driven that. And you're seeing that start to really provide yield in the overall business. Maybe, Eric start with you, just in terms of just places you're seeing it show up every day and I think the point Mike made around our colleagues are reacting to that, not just clients is important, too.
Eric Andersen: Thanks, Greg. And I think really comes down to a couple of big areas. Certainly, we're continuing to invest in our teams. The capability and the development that they have to be able to provide the right insight I think is critical. Certainly, data and analytics is something that we talked about consistently, trying to drive content-driven insight and creating new areas of demand and, essentially, growing the pie in the business is also a major focus. And then obviously, having the right tools to be able to execute for clients. Is -- we see investment opportunities and growth areas across all 5 solution lines.
Gregory Case: Terrific. Mike, thoughts?
Michael O'Connor: Yes. I think, as Eric said, we see opportunities with new clients and existing, and maybe I'd highlight a couple of things that come to mind. First, we're using data and analytics to draw out insight to be able to serve clients more effectively, and a great example of that is Aon Client Treaty. We talked about that before. That is data-driven insight for us to be able to provide better solution for clients all over the world. It's driven by client demand and the ability for us to unite capabilities within our Insurance and Reinsurance businesses to provide a distinctive solution, and we see continued growth and continued benefit for clients. And then there are many parts of the business we are very excited about. Transaction liability, we highlighted, continues to be a real area of client need, and we continue to invest behind that to continue to deepen our team and grow our geographic coverage, both to serve corporates and private equity and investors. So very excited about that space and see continued investment opportunity there
Gregory Case: Perfect.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just a follow-up on the numbers a little bit, may be just for Christa. The restructuring savings. If we keep that flat again in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, you guys are going to be at nearly $360 million of restructuring savings for this year versus your $300 million goal. I guess where is the upside coming from? And is that more something that we should think about as a pull forward,, realizing the savings earlier? Or are we at a point where you start to have some visibility where you think you'd have upside of the $450 million target for next year?
Christa Davies: Yes. So Dave, thank you so much for the question. We're extremely excited about the restructuring program and its ability to invest in building the Aon United operating model that's going to deliver the $300 million of savings in 2018 to $450 million of savings in 2019, but much more importantly than that, productivity gains and operating leverage in each year after that. And I would say in terms of where we're up to, we're very excited about the progress year-to-date, in the program. It's really a lot of investments in real estate, in IT and in people around our operating model. We're not in the business of updating guidance. As we think about this restructuring program, it's a 3-year program which will continue until the end of 2019. What I can say is that we're very excited and confident about delivering the $300 million in savings this year and $450 million in savings next year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just lastly on organic growth, that was really strong across -- especially the commercial book and Reinsurance and in some ways surprisingly strong against the comp, a tough comp. Are you guys seeing more so an uptick in end market demand or is some of this, do you think, some market share gains that you guys are enjoying?
A – Gregory Case: It's really -- it's a combination, Dave, across the board. Again, as Eric and Mike both highlighted, we're look -- in essence, looking at client need, client demand and we're actually driving ways to actually improve and bringing new solutions to the -- to bear on behalf of clients. So some of the things that Eric and Mike talked about in cyber and transaction liability, et cetera, sort of our new opportunities we're bringing to the market. We've been very fortunate from a market share standpoint, that continues to improve. That's improving because, again, candidly, we're bringing better solutions to clients. So that's -- we think that will improve over time. And net-net, you're seeing strength across -- really across the solution lines. And again, look for it not in any 1 quarter in particular but over the course of the year, you're going to see us continue to progress. As we talked about, mid-single digit or greater goal over the coming years is really our focus from a growth standpoint and you're going to see us do that. Obviously, as you sort of think about the quarters, Q4 was a particularly unique quarter last year. So we're going to be pushing against that as we end the year, but look for continued progress and that's what our team's most excited about.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Sarah DeWitt, JPMoran.
Sarah DeWitt : As far as -- one of your competitors recently announced a large acquisition. Could you just talk about how your thoughts on how this could impact the competitive dynamics and how important is scale?
Gregory Case: Yes. So from my standpoint -- look, success in our world is -- fundamentally starts with understanding client need and really understanding client need and how it evolves. And we will come back to -- there's always lots written about sort of the market view or the intermediary view or what have you. But frankly, it's all irrelevant when you compare it against sort of how client need is evolving over time. And our perspective is if you get a very clear view on that, and for us, it's all things risk, all things retirement, all things health, how is that evolving over time? And then very specifically, how are we building a unique capability to address that need, both in the traditional way and the emerging risk way. So I'd come back to, if you think about sort of the investments we've made, in Stroz, that was directly against the cyber opportunity. In Townsend, against delegated. In Admix, against health. In cut-e, in talent. And then organically, the investments we've made in data analytics and ACT and in mortgage and et cetera and the exchanges. So from our standpoint, this is -- has to be absolutely maniacally focused on sort of delivering more effectively for client need. And in doing so, we're creating net new demand and competing in the traditional market we think very effectively. Our view is, that approach to the world, combined with what is unique financial flexibility and a focus on translating revenue into free cash flow, we're not only going to serve clients effectively but also create a set of economic results that we think will be very, very positive for our partner shareholders. So from our standpoint, obviously, elements of scale and size matter. You'll continue to see movements in the marketplace, but it's really that focus, we think, is going to determine victory.
Sarah DeWitt : Okay, great. And then on the restructuring initiative. You talked about how this should then drive improved productivity over the long term. Can you just elaborate on that? Or are you saying that there is potential for expense savings opportunities above and beyond the $450 million that you've identified? And could you just explain that a bit more?
Christa Davies: Absolutely, Sara. So yes it is the answer to your question. We think that if you think about delivering $450 million of savings in 2019, then your run rate exiting '19 is higher than $450 million, so we'll continue to deliver more savings in 2020. But much more importantly than that is productivity and operating leverage built into the platform because when you aggregate your operations under 1 operating model, Aon United, then we are able to apply automation, AI, machine learning and really continue to drive productivity savings in future years in 2020 and '21. And so we're very excited about that future productivity benefits. And that really gives us confidence in long-term margin expansion, driven by top line revenue growth acceleration, improvements in the business mix and productivity.
Gregory Case: One other piece I'd just throw in, Sarah, is Christa and the team have orchestrated this effort. What's also unique about it, it's not just the cost saves now, as you know, and the productivity improvement over time, and this is really sort of an offshoot of Aon United and the leadership approach we've taken. As we continue to connect the firm and see opportunities, this isn't just about cost. This isn't just about efficiency, it's about effectiveness. We believe what we're going to be delivering in service and approach on behalf of clients is going to improve as we get more efficient in the process. So that really is how this is very different than anything we've seen undertaken in our industry and certainly anything we've undertaken before.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: My first question is around organic growth kind of long-term and maybe some thoughts from your perspective in terms of your positioning in the market, especially given some consolidation initiatives we've seen among some of your peers as of late. It seems like your -- with your guidance of kind of mid-single digit organic growth or better over the long term, you're pretty confident in your positioning, but would like to hear more about that if we could. And also maybe a little bit of clarity on the -- kind of what gives you the confidence that over a long period of time, you can achieve organic growth that seems just above and beyond what we've seen others guide to over several years on and across different companies.
Gregory Case: Yes. I'll start with that and Mike and Eric can comment as well. Listen, as we think about this, again, we start with a formulation focused on clients, client need and client evolution in terms of how it's playing out over time. And you see us addressing that need. And what we would remind you of, in the categories we play in, risk, retirement and health, these are highly fragmented in terms of sort of who serves those markets and underpenetrated. So you think about the risk market overall and what's happening in the global economy, of top 10 risks in the world, only 3 really have -- this is, by the way, the top 10 risks based on our client input, only 3 really have great insurance solutions against them. So in essence, the world is becoming more risky, and we have an opportunity to actually keep up. And if you just keep up, we're going to grow. Now, what if we did better than that? What if we actually provided a cyber solution that really provided more insight and helped clients reduce volatility more effectively? Or opportunities to actually protect our balance sheet more effectively. So from our standpoint, we see an underpenetrated risk market in which we can create net new demand and serve clients more effectively over time. And in doing so, ironically, what happens is we do better in our traditional business. So the example Eric described was a great one because not only do we take a great reinsurance client and offer some things from our retirement solutions area, our -- and Eric just talk about this, our reinsurance relationship strengthened and as a result of that combination. So that's really the whole piece. When you think about some the things we've done in government de-risking. The World Bank cat bonds, and I know I talked about it last time, I love this example, because literally, we took 4 countries, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. We addressed their quake risk in a way that's never been done before. It was an actual investment purchased by pension money, orchestrated by the World Bank. And given back -- that money was actually given back to the economies. That is net new demand. Now I would ask you, how many economies around the world that are underdeveloped or developing, would actually benefit from a cover like that. Then you're off to the races on a brand new category. So for us, this is about addressing current client need and addressing net new, and doing so in a way in which we can both go after both -- do this through organic and in M&A and that's all going to play back to organic growth. So just -- thoughts Eric or Mike, in terms of sort of pieces? Eric, you want to...
Eric Andersen: I would just say, Greg, because I thought the way you described it was perfect, but also just to underscore the Aon United strategy within the firm, I think is really compelling. Mike and I both shared examples, but there are dozens of those examples that exist in the firm where, for example, one of our client leaders working with firms out West to deal with wildfires or bringing insurance linked securities, capability to look at that risk in a new way. Or where there's a commercial risk leader that is handling the traditional insurance business for an insurer, was able to underscore or uncover during the Client Promise discovery period a need for additional reinsurance capital in part of their business and made those connections. So the ability to bring all the different solution lines to any given firm should be able to drive us that growth that we're talking about.
Yaron Kinar: So is it that the degree of underpenetration of insurance in the market has been increasing over time? Or is it your capability of addressing that underpenetrated that's been improving over time?
Gregory Case: Go ahead, Mike.
Michael O'Connor: Well, I think it's both. I mean, the reality is, we see opportunities to continue to build capabilities within our solution lines to serve clients more deeply and bring more clients into the firm, and that's underpinned by our investments in data analytics. And it's also crossing capabilities across solution lines. And I think we highlighted Aon Client Treaty where that does not happen without insurance and reinsurance capabilities. And you could think about some of the things we're doing with our retail clients, bringing reinsurance tools to bear like Impact Forecasting where we're bringing real insight through data and analytics to our retail clients. So I think it's both.
Gregory Case: Yes. The other piece, Yaron, just -- and we've talked about this on previous calls. This, for us, is not just conceptual. This is our life every day around the battle for relevance, and it really is a battle for relevance in entire industry. In essence, are we helping companies address volatility in a more effective way? And I think you can make an argument, the answer is the industry as a whole, us in the middle of it, has not. We have not kept up. If you look at kind of claims as a percent of GDP back in the '60s and '70s, it's kind of essentially 1.5%, 2%, give or take. It grows, by the way, virtually every year until the late '80s to about 3%, 3.5%. And then systematically it's come down every year since. So it's back to where it was in the 60s. So net-net, as the global economy has grown -- if you think about another fact, 75% of the market cap of the S&P 500 is driven off of intangible assets. That's fundamentally changed from 1975 where it was about to 25%. And so as that world has changed, we have not collectively kept up. We have not actually addressed volatility. We see that as a huge opportunity to actually help clients grow and drive opportunity for them and reduce risk. You've also seen us, by the way, done -- we've done some analysis with some very large tech companies. And by the way, some of these large tech companies are bigger than our insurers. They don't need the capital to protect their balance sheet, but we've used insurance solutions as a way to actually create demand for them. In fact, they put a demand in the marketplace, so it's way beyond insurance. They're putting a product in the marketplace and consumers are buying it because we've actually provided cover to protect them from cyber risk on their product. And so these are kinds of things we're doing to create net new demand that we think a real opportunity, and frankly drive relevance, not just for us, but for the global -- insurers in the global economy.
Yaron Kinar: Got it. And my second question was just around the effective tax rate, so you're guiding that down for the year, to below 18%. With some guidance expected on the BEAT later this year. Any thoughts as to how the effective tax rate plays out in '19 and beyond?
Christa Davies: Yes. Thanks for the question. We did previously give guidance of 18% for this year, and given the impacts of discretes we saw in Q3, the 2018 full year tax rate will be below 18%. As I look back historically, Yaron, what I would say is, exclusive of the impacts of discretes, which can be positive or negative and unpredictable in any year, our historical underlying tax rate for the last 3 years was approximately 18%. And so we're not giving guidance going forward but I think that gives you some sense.
Yaron Kinar: Just asking about the BEAT tax itself. Any clarifications that are expected this year?
Christa Davies: Yes. So I guess, Yaron, the way we think about it is an all-in underlying rate, and what we would say is if you look at the last 3 years, it's been about 18%. And for 2018 in particular, it will be slightly below 18% really just driven by the discretes you saw in Q3.
Operator: Our next question from Kai Pan.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much for making Eric and Mike available for this discussion. I just want to follow up around the conversation to ask Eric and Mike. What has changed in terms of your day-to-day operations in the responsibility under Aon United. And you gave a lot of good example how the work could drive collaboration and drive growth. But are there any execution risks or potential pitfalls you are worried about in terms of speed of execution as well as accountability?
Gregory Case: We think, Kai, as they respond to their day-to-day piece. I'd start with what are the changes beyond just the copresidents. Remember, we talked about a single P&L. We talked about a single opco and a single brand, all steps that, frankly driven by Eric and Mike and our broader team, sort of really were a catalyst to sort of accelerate Aon United. And has implications, of course, for their day-to-day, which they'll talk about, but it really was built on that foundation. So thoughts, gentlemen?
Michael O'Connor: I can jump in, Greg. I think as Eric highlighted, Eric and I have a long history of working together. And I think it's been -- this is the culmination of that to actually bring to life Aon United. And I think our leadership team has stepped up over a number of years. We have intimacy in that group. We have great connectivity. So I think as we come together and unite the firm, run through 1 global operating committee, have great confidence that not only will we not miss a beat, I think we have expectations we can accelerate our execution capabilities. Eric?
Eric Andersen: And I would just say the connectivity that we're trying to bring to the firm as a partnership, I think is really beginning to get momentum. And Mike and I have been spending a fair amount of time around the world with our colleagues and our clients, just reinforcing the fact that we have to work, work closer together and that the reality is the clients are pushing us to do it. They're looking at the degree of risk that they are facing, and they're looking at the solutions that we have across the firm. And we said earlier about bringing down structural barriers, the ability for us to bring the entire company to help solve a client's problem builds great momentum inside the firm. You asked about risks as well, and I would just say the execution risk for us is speed. The clients problems are here and they're now, and if we don't find a way to solve them and be able to bring the firm together as quickly as we need to do, then they'll be solved by someone else in some other way. So I think what drives us the most is the fact that we see the need. We know we have the tools, it's just how fast we can get it together to get it in front of the clients.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: That's great. My second question and margin front. If you're looking into 2019, your cost saving $450 million versus $300 million this year would be $150 million. That equates about 130 basis points of margin expansion, if assuming half of that flows through bottom line, would be like 60 basis points. And your core margin expansion, underlying core margin expansion, you mentioned year-to-date about 50 basis points. If you can sustain that, you could add up to like, more than 100 basis points year-over-year margin expansion into 2019. Christa, I'm just wondering, is that a right way to think about your margin potential going forward?
Christa Davies: Kai, we don't obviously give margin guidance going forward. But what we can say is we're very excited about continuing to be able to expand margins through 3 key sources. One is accelerating revenue growth, which you've seen in calendar year '19. But you also saw, for the last couple of years, we've been continuing to accelerate organic revenue growth and M&A's contributing to total revenue growth of 10% year-to-date. The second is mix shift. We continue to invest in higher revenue growth, higher margin businesses, both organically and inorganically. And Greg gave some great descriptions of those businesses earlier. And the third is the restructuring savings and ongoing productivity beyond 2019. And so we feel really good about the future margin expansion potential of the firm.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Last one, if I may. It's on your cyber and also transaction liability business. You said it had been growing double digits. I just wonder how big are this business relative to your overall portfolio and specific on the silent cyber initiative you're doing, you worry about it becoming competitor of your clients, not the clients on the insurance side but also you're using reinsurance. Is there any residual balance sheet risk to Aon?
Gregory Case: There's -- just to start with that one, there's no residual balance sheet risk. As you know, Kai, we're not in the business of sort of taking balance sheet risk. Ours is sort of to connect capital with need, and we do that around the world with our insurers and with alternative capital and all the different pieces around that. What we would say on the cyber side, just generally, is look, this is about net opportunity and it really starts again with our recurring theme around client need. Clients, if you think about it -- we've talked about it before. And the numbers are sort of connected to cyber trauma. Incurred $450 billion of pain, of loss in 2017 and against that's -- that's against $3 billion to $4 billion in premium that was written. So we might be the largest and it might be growing double digit and we're very excited about it. And by the way, our team's done an exceptional job. When you think about $3 billion to $4 billion in the context of $450 billion, Kai, that's massive opportunity to help clients succeed. And then remember, that $450 billion as I described on previous calls is really a North American figure. The European figure is close to 0 because they didn't actually need to report cyber. It wasn't required. Until May of 2018. So just a few months ago, the European data laws sort of kicked in, and those are incredibly onerous. So the cyber connected loss, not -- connected loss is going to go to $1 trillion on the dial, and the industry has responded with $3 billion to $4 billion. So for us, we see massive opportunity, for our clients, if we get this right, when we get this right. Frankly, for the industry as well and real opportunity. And so this is back to the idea that Mike and Eric were talking about in terms of emerging real risks that we can help clients succeed. And again, as Eric described, if we don't sort it for them and solve it, they're going to find other ways to do it. We see this as a substantial opportunity.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Okay. How big are they now relative to your portfolio?
Gregory Case: Very small, very, very small. These are kind of new initiatives we've put in place, think good representative examples of sort of steps we've taken but they're very, very small, tiny in terms of the broader overall Aon but we think they have tremendous potential.
Operator: You're next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question. Pretty strong Reinsurance growth this quarter. You guys had pretty -- a tougher comp last Q3, about 10% organic when you adjust for rev-rec, and you have a 20% comp in the fourth quarter, obviously a lot of reinstatements and cap ons after the hurricanes last year. How do you see that? Is that a headwind or is it something that you can kind of offset to a certain degree like you did this quarter? And should we think about that being -- I know you highlighted the 50 basis points of kind of core underlying margin expansion year-to-date. Is that going to be a headwind in the fourth quarter just because Reinsurance is such high margin business or does it help that I guess you have less revenue coming through in the fourth quarter? A - Gregory Case Well, listen, overall, again, you just got to step back and look at the trend line, sort of what our colleagues have been able to do in Reinsurance Solutions and I would just highlight, it's been exceptional. If you look at the last few years and our ability to actually win new clients and do more with clients is actually continuing to progress. And you're seeing that, Elyse, and that's played out sort of in the first 9 much of the year. Look, Q4 -- I just want to emphasize that trend line, that overall progress is exceptional, and the team's been great on the treaty side, on the fact side, the alternative side just absolutely exceptional, and I think we see that trend line. Again, we always come back to sort of those trend line on a particular quarter. As you highlight, Q4 is unique. It's unique sort of in history, it's, by the way, our smallest quarter as you've described. The comp is very unique. We know what was going on last year is going to create a sort of headwinds in the fourth quarter, no doubt, in terms of where we are. But the overall time line and the overall trend has been exceptionally positive. But Q4, the comp is -- there's no doubt, very, very difficult from that standpoint. Eric, anything you'd add to that? A - Eric Andersen Yes. I would just add, Greg, a couple of things, One, we continue to see good success in the build out of the core treaty business in terms of new clients and expanded business with existing clients. Our facultative business in the third quarter was exceptionally strong and we were able also to do new things with some new client groups, whether it's government entities or firms like that, that are a little broader than the normal remit. People think of reinsurance for insurance companies. I think the combination of the 3 has been positive for us all year. And so it's led to a good 9 months. A - Gregory Case I would say -- this goes back to, Elyse -- very specifically, trends, exceptionally positive. Q4, definitely, definitely a major hurdle as we think about sort of the comparison.
Elyse Greenspan: And as we think about a few months forward and as you start having conversation with clients, do you guys have kind of a high level little view on what kind of prices we could expect in the Reinsurance market January 1 renewals? A - Gregory Case As we talked over time, really don't spend a lot of time on the -- talking about sort of predictions on the pricing front in particular, just given sort of our analytics and what we do day-to-day with our clients. Overall, we'd say, Elyse, when you look at pricing against sort of the progress for the first 9 months of the year, it's really sort of continues to sort of being at par, if you will. There's pluses and minuses depending on sort of what you've encountered as a client and what kind of trauma you've encountered. But overall, the overall marketplace for us continues to be relatively stable.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then one on the expense saves. I know we had a few earlier questions. So you guys are at $308 million, the end of your target for this year was $300 million. And Christa, are you implying that you guys aren't, even if you guys get well ahead of that by the end of this year, that you guys won't potentially raise the program again? Or is it just that, that's not something that you kind of looked in to date? I just kind of want to understand how we can tie that all together and our thoughts around that.
Christa Davies: Sure, Elyse. I guess the simple thing I would say is we're not in the business of updating guidance. It's a 3-year program. We've got until the end of 2019, and we're very excited about the progress we've made to date. And we're on track to deliver $300 million of savings this year and the $450 million of savings next year.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And then one last question. Repurchase was a little bit lighter than what we had modeled. Was there anything in the quarter that caused that to slow down a little bit? Or it's just kind of timing, when buyback kind of comes during the year, maybe your stock actually did better this quarter. Did that play into kind of thoughts around repurchasing shares?
Christa Davies: Yes. So Elyse, as you know, we allocate capital based on return on capital, cash on cash returns. Share repurchase remains the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon. What did happen in the quarter is we did accelerate $80 million of pension contributions from future years into Q3. And so that was 1 factor that impacted us. But long-term, we see a very highly valued internal valuation of Aon, which is why the return on capital opportunity is so substantial for us.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Meyer Shields of KBW.
Meyer Shields: I have two, I think, somewhat related questions. The first is based on really, everything that you talked about on this and previous calls, should we expect what you term the market impact to be less of a factor in either direction going forward? A - Gregory Case Again as we come back, we talk about market impact, it really is the insured value part of the world and the pricing part of the world and as we've described before, insured values, sort of if you think about those actually has a more material impact over time than the pricing piece. And all I've tried to highlight is, if you think about sort of what we said on previous calls around the influence of pricing, that hasn't changed that dramatically. But if you think about the long-term view, maybe Eric, you want to start. Mike, you want to chime in? A - Eric Andersen Yes. I would just say, Greg, that the overall structure of the business remains largely unchanged from the beginning of the year. Even with natural catastrophes in Japan, Florida Panhandle, some of the man-made losses like the Genoa bridge disaster. The total cap budgets are largely in line with what the reinsurers and the insurers expected. So our senses is that with the supply and demand that was there at the beginning of the year, that's relatively unchanged. I would say the interesting part though is we try and bring that capital to provide cover for new risk, I think that's where there's growth in the business. A - Michael O'Connor Yes. And the only thing I would add is with our investments in the Reinsurance business and insurance business and data and analytics, we think about this risk by risk. We are spending our time making sure we understand our clients intimately well and can think about the right answer for them, and we will source solutions for them anywhere in the world that makes sense. A - Gregory Case And the final piece, I think to throw into this, Meyer, is the following. Listen, these conversations around pricing in this marketplace are obviously important and relevant, et cetera. We try to put them in context. And again, ours is not about pricing, ours is about client value and how we deliver on that. But what I really want to come back to is, this is about Aon, right? This is about, literally, we put 6% up, sort of in, a though -- in the quarter. It's about progress, and if you think about sort of the overall portfolio of Aon, the retirement side, the investment side, the health side. What we do in data and analytics more broadly. Less and less of our business is even connected to this in any way, shape or form and even in the context of the risk business, less and less -- obviously important, but less and less relevant over time. So I just want to put in the overall context in terms of sort of how this fits into the broader Aon portfolio, single opco, single operating model, single P&L.
Meyer Shields: That's helpful, that's really where I was driving at. So that really clarifies things. Second question, and clearly, I understand the bottom line impact of what you're talking about. But how do you think about areas of technology actually reducing risk. And I guess, autonomous cars, if I mean we could flip a switch and have them tomorrow, would be a good example of one major current risk significantly evaporating. How big of a factor is that? A - Gregory Case Again, this is back to -- if you think about -- sort of -- I think I understand your question. Will technology actually reduce volatility and risk in the world over time? And we would say, listen, we would love to find areas where that's true. More and more of what our clients actually come to us with, and this is a point Eric and Mike were making, they come to us with implications on how technology changes the business model but also changes the risk profile, and in a number of respects, increases the risk profile. And at this point in time, with technology change, even if they think they have it figured it out, there's massive uncertainty. So for us, this is the perfect time to sort of be in a changing global economy in which there is so much change going on, and risk overall is going up. By the way, it's not just risk in the classic risk business. It's risk in the retirement world. It's risk in the health world. So it really is volatility in the world today that we think is greater than ever before. I described intellectual property. All these things are sort of areas that actually are changing over time, and net-net, you'd be very hard-pressed not to say that the basket of risk in the world today is not going up. And to the point we've made on the call already, ours is the question of can we maintain relevance? Can we keep up? Can we bring solutions, either capital or risk transfer solutions that matter, retirement solutions, health solutions that matter, that help our clients improve performance or reduce their volatility? So that's why in the end, this is really about how we evolve and why that evolution can't be the traditional evolution. It isn't just about getting bigger, it's really got to be getting better and bringing higher quality to clients.
Operator: Last question is coming from Adam Klauber [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Could you flesh out the New Ventures Group? It sounds very interesting. So a couple of follow-ups. One, I think you relate that at -- it really has to do with increasing value for a client. You gave 1. Could you maybe give another example or 2 of what those activities could be? Two, could that be an area where you direct more -- do some more acquisitions? And then three, and I think you mentioned your first. Does this area involve more potential activity with private equity and venture capital? A - Gregory Case Yes. So Adam, just to step back. In essence, this is just another step in the journey. We think an important one, but another step in the journey. Mike and Eric both talked about innovation and what we're doing to bring new solutions to clients. New Ventures is essentially saying, listen, we've gone proven approaches. They work exceptionally well. Can we be faster? This is to Eric's point on speed matters. Can we be faster at identifying opportunities and then scaling them globally? So this is an internal effort in which we got a group of senior leaders. Again, one of the manifestations of having the single opco and single P&L and our copresidents doing what they're doing, it's allowed us to free up leadership time to focus really more strongly on this. If you think about sort of what we're doing in data and analytics and all the pieces around that and John Bruno's area. Efforts around -- really across the firm. Ours is really about how we can accelerate those. So that's fundamentally what really New Ventures is about, and you'll see us pick 2 or 3 or 4 areas and we'll have a portfolio in which we're really trying to identify where and how we can accelerate. This is not about third-party investment, private equity investment, it's not about that at all. It's really about how we take ideas and scale them more globally, more effectively. And we've got, I'm not going to go through the portfolio today. We want you to see them evolve over time. I think they're going to be pretty interesting. But -- and reasonably significant but we have to prove it out and we have to drive it. But we know without this capability, it's very hard to actually get enough energy and effort to really scale something effectively. And that's really what New Ventures is about and I think under Tony Goland's leadership, I think with our broader group across the group, it will be a very interesting set of steps that will strengthen the firm.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And then on Health Solutions, a very strong quarter. New business in EMEA region. Is that more multinational clients? Or is that more European or other EMEA-based clients. And I guess is there -- is that a growing pipeline in that type of business? A - Gregory Case Listen, first of all, thanks for recognizing and drawing out health. Again, as you know, we love this category. We think globally it represents a monumental opportunity to assist clients and what is really a frankly, pressing and intensifying set of needs, back to the question on is demand going up or going down? We think it's going up. And what's going on in EMEA, by the way, you're seeing throughout the course of the year, across the world. It's not only serving local clients with what we think are better sense of solutions. It's also serving global clients who want more consistent health beats around the world, very, very important. And in addition, augmenting what they have, voluntary benefits and things that actually make the value proposition stronger. So you're seeing that. In EMEA, in this quarter, you've seen it across the world, and we think it's actually going to continue strongly. And it's, again, one of the reasons we like this category so much.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And you touched on it, but voluntary benefits in the U.S. Strong growth there. Is that your increasing your product set, increasing your capabilities? I guess what's driving some expansion there? A - Gregory Case Again, it's both. Again, back to client demand. Clients really want to see new opportunities, they want to see solutions that actually improve well-being and you go beyond a specific product area. And you've -- sort of you've seen us bring a number of new solutions to markets that have actually served, again, our clients well. And we think have great trends ahead of them.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And 1 final for Christa. On the free cash, I think you mentioned in the range of $600 million plus would be freed up in the next 2 years that had been used in restructuring, if I'm correct. Is that weighted more towards '19 or '20 to the extent you could say? A - Christa Davies Yes. So Adam, what we would say is as you look at the slide deck, I'm just finding the slide. We've actually outlined this. So it's $650 million of cash flow reduction. So a reduction in use of cash on pension restructuring and CapEx. It's Page 23 of the slide deck posted on our website. So $650 million, it's not just from restructuring. It's a reduction in CapEx and it's reduction in pension contributions as well.
Operator: Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory Case: I just want to say everybody thank you very much for joining call, really appreciate it and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect from the call.+s

Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2018 results as well as having been posted on our Web site. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc.
Gregory C. Case: Thanks, Shaun, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. After many, many conference calls, we’re excited to introduce a new approach today all intended to be hopefully more helpful for all of you. Christa and I would like to start by highlighting our colleagues around the world delivered a strong result in Q2 and the first half of the year reinforcing our continued momentum we talked about in the first quarter call as well. Beginning on today's call, what we plan to do is post for your a comprehensive standalone document that provides both financial backup and a commentary on our strategic priorities, and really how are plans are producing results. And we're confident, you will let us know how we can improve the new approach, but we really want to make sure you know what our intend is here, a broader based conversation. Fundamentally the document we posted is meant to provide all that we’d have covered in our initial commentary and more. And as a result, we plan to use our time on the call to provide a little bit more insight into the longer-term view for the firm. This approach will also allow us to describe two or three investment or growth areas that we think are strengthening our capability to serve clients pretty fundamentally and hopefully you get the idea. We hope to give you a better insight on Aon, and important areas around our firm, like our journey to deliver Aon United. And that's really a perfect place to start a discussion today. The idea of Aon United at scale and the benefits that accrue when our global firm works together effectively are substantial. And it's not historically -- never, we’ve covered on this call, but nonetheless it's a very important piece of our long-term success and a real growing strength of Aon. You will see we took significant steps over the last quarter to build on that strength, executing our announced changes to deliver more consistently. On a value proposition, we know our clients like and are demanding more and more, and we know its distinctive. And this is really about how we make available to them. The global capability of our firm tailored to them, fully suiting their business needs and objectives and we will be bringing us together the capability of Aon against client needs in a very broad based way, it is highly effective. Its powerful. It's meaningful. And we call this leading Aon United. More specifically, you saw the thinking and the commitment reflected in our May 15 announcement, which described all these -- the number of these changes, all of which were designed to make it easier to bring the best of the firm to our clients. So you saw, we’re moving around leadership. We establish co-presidents, Eric Anderson and Mike O'Connor, two great colleagues of the firm that will be wonderful in these roles. They will also be overseeing a new global Aon Operating Committee, which also includes direction of global business services, all of which reinforces the single P&L that we announced in 2017 and really encourages Aon United decisions that accelerate growth by bringing the best to the firm to our clients. So a series of moves around leadership. Single brand. You saw us announced that we'd be again retiring the remaining business unit brands, primarily Aon Risk Solutions and Aon Benfield, following on a similar step with Aon Hewitt in 2017. And I would tell you we’re very excited -- very excited about the prospect of 50,000 Aon colleagues going to market as Aon. I'm from Aon. Reinforcing our priority to address client opportunities and innovation and really creating more distinctive solutions. So a whole series of things around a single brand, around Aon. And finally you saw moving around innovation, structural movement. We created a leadership capacity to drive more effort and drive forward on our new Data and Analytics offerings, we expanded John Bruno's role to become CEO of Data and Analytics services and always again designed a focus on investments and strengthen our innovation agenda and drive long-term growth. So in Aon, that’s -- what this is all about, long-term growth. The idea of leading Aon United. For us, this is well beyond improving the value and the power of this idea and this ethic. We see very clearly so many examples of the economic leverage embedded in this pursuit. Now our leadership focus and what you’re seeing us do is how we deliver this more consistently, how we deliver this upscale across the firm. And we believe this is highly relevant for a call like this with our long-term partners as leading Aon United is a source of client value. It's also very compelling for our colleagues. It's really a magnet to attract and retain talented leaders. And I will say we’ve been laying the foundation for Aon United for over a decade, evolving our portfolio, investing in new content capability, bringing those pieces together more closely together through programs like Aon Client Promise, which we’ve talked about before, but a number of others as well. But it's really just in the last few quarters that we truly entered the era of Aon United and taking more structural change to bring that about. And I will just say, again on the spirit of the format here, I will just give you one example. And this is an example discussed last week with our colleagues, the large U.S health system. And the example brings to life, how colleagues come together to talk to clients. And this is historically been a strong commercial risk clients. So imagine we’re in the room with the risk manager and our commercial risk team, historically been a great client as I described before, as part of the Aon Client Promise work, which is a systematic way to understand client needs, our team begin to understand this major U.S health system at a desire and a strategy to begin to have their hospitals really seek out sort of the idea of be getting paid for outcome. So outcome-based payments. Obviously, this is a major trend that this client really wants to lead the way in that and obviously a whole series of substantial operating challenges ahead for them to do that. But our team having heard that stepped back. So this risk team gather capability from around the firm. They brought commercial risk capability together more broadly. They brought our reinsurance colleagues to the table, reinsurance analytics colleagues to the table, and after a few hours together it was really clear. If our clients successful doing what they wanted to, they’re going to inject greater volatility into their business. They may be right in the first six or seven years, but in the eighth year, if something happens to the population, they’re actually trying to support, there's a lot more volatility, in fact, put the hospital at risk. And when we talk to our clients about it, they were absolutely concerned. They really want to understand what we could do. And in the end our reinsurance colleagues bring to table analytic capability to model the risk, to really understand what was on the table for them and then giving them solutions on ways they could potentially transfer the risk. In essence what our colleagues did is we went from a risk discussion on the commercial side to really a more strategy discussion on how we can enable their strategy and lower the volatility and lower their risk. And this was really -- if you think about it, a constellation of colleagues, which we brought together broader commercial risk team with the reinsurance team and a set of topics we never would've talked about before with his client. And this commercial risk capability, the reinsurance modeling access to the markets literally change the discussion with this client. And if you think about it, this opportunity for our colleagues was incredibly compelling. They’re very excited to serve this hospital system in a much more broad based way. Our clients are excited and I don’t need to tell you what that probably does for our -- back to our original relationship. On the commercial risk side, what that retention would look like sort of over time. So very, very powerful in terms of what this could be. So just to reflect sort of on those examples, these are the kinds of things that Aon United leadership enabled us to do.  In terms of financial impact and what this bring for us, we just highlight three overarching takeaways that come out of the first half of the year. The first, continued momentum. And we saw this in our accrual results and truly just continuous to increase the conviction we have to run or exceed $7.97 of EPS for the year, highlighted by a Q2 performance of 5% organic growth, margin expansion of 130 basis points, EPS growth of 31% and free cash flow growth of 17%. So strong momentum for the first half of the year and for the quarter. Second, we are continuing to invest and to generate long-term growth, supported by our strong balance sheet and significant free cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, we believe leading Aon United at scale will translate into stronger organic growth. And we continue to invest in our inorganic opportunities that allow us to innovate faster than our clients on the topics that matter most to them. Then again in the spirit of the new format, the example the World Bank cap on I talked about in the last call, very compelling to think about that doesn't happen without Aon United behavior. When you’re connecting the World Bank, trying to protect Chile, Columbia, Mexico and Peru, from earthquake risk that was here for -- not covered before, and you’re trying to bring together a constellation of leaders in each of those countries and the World Bank, imagine who we had to bring to the table or make that happen. But we have the analytic capability, the data capability to do this, but that wasn't enough. We also have the relationships at each one of the countries and with the World Bank to do it, but that wasn't enough. And it wasn't until we brought this whole group together that we have come up with a incredibly innovative solution of $1.4 billion bond that by the way the World Bank invest back into the country, so it strengthen their economy and protects them from a risk that here before was never, never covered before and a real investment instrument that has ever been brought to market before. So you get the idea in terms of sort of what this means for innovation on top of just client leadership and finally it's important to highlight the long-term productivity improvements from a global business services model, also continue to enable additional investment in emerging client needs like cyber intellectual property. So whole series of things sort of come out of the quarter and come out of the first part of the year that reinforce the momentum and what we want you to try to understand is this context underscores that Aon United is all about growth. So we discuss with our team Aon United equals growth. When we drive this set of behaviors on behalf of our clients, good things happened. Client leadership happens, retention happens, new client opportunities happen, innovation happens. And again it's a simple concept to describe, but difficult to replicate, especially in our industry. And I will just say I’m very grateful to our team for their willingness to take on the opportunity and really excited about the progress we've made in these new expanded roles over the course of the quarter, over the course of the year, and what this means for us as we move Aon forward. So giving you a little perspective on the topic, Again, we wouldn’t have discussed on this call traditionally. For us its fundamental to the long-term growth of our firm and we will drive long-term growth in our firm and we want to give you a little context that you wouldn't have otherwise got to put sort of the results sort of in the perspective. And with that high level summary in mind, I’d like get Christa to offer a few thoughts and then we will open up to your questions. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In the spirit of this new format, I will cover the key metrics, and then talk for example how we’re driving operating leverage and investing in Aon, both organically and inorganically. The steps we’re taking and our strong progress here to date continues to reinforce both our short and long-term performance target. Our performance in the first half reflects organic revenue growth of 4%, an acceleration from 3% in the first half of 2017. In addition to accelerating organic growth, M&A is continuing to contribute, both improving the mix and driving total growth of a 11% for the first half of 2018. Adjusted operating margins increased 200 basis points year-to-date, an acceleration from our historic average of 70 to 80 basis points a year over the last 10 years. Accelerating revenue combined with margin expansion is delivering operating income growth, which was exceptionally strong at 20% year-to-date with core operating income growth reflecting half of the performance. EPS growth of $0.28 year-to-date places us firmly on track to exceed our short-term target of $7.97 in earnings per share for 2018. And lastly, reported free cash flow decreased $52 million year-over-year, driven by increased restructuring, reflecting this is our peak year of restructuring cash usage. Adjusting for restructuring, underlying free cash flow grew 17% year-over-year, reinforcing our commitment to double-digit free cash flow. And even stronger performance when combined with the 6% reduction in shares outstanding. Overall, the strong financial performance and long-term outlook are supported by the investments we’re making in our operating model in an Aon United way, as Greg described. Through the creation of our next generation of global business services model, we’re creating greater scalability, productivity, and operating leverage. One example is the consolidation of all of our North American call centers across our solution lines. We implemented a single industry leading cloud platform with global reach. It resulted in higher support for clients, better flexibility in managing capacity and cost savings of approximately $10 million annually. Another example is consolidating our procurement spend globally. We now manage approximately 80% of our spend or $2 billion across nine major categories in four regional hubs. That’s up from about $1 billion of spend across four categories in our two largest countries. To do this, we implemented a cloud based to pay solutions across 60 countries, supported by an offshore model. And that cloud platform is giving us greater insight into that total spend to be able to manage it more effectively over time. Through this, we’ve delivered $30 million of value in 2018. These are just two examples of the long-term margin expansion that will continue through productivity improvements from our single operating model and the remaining savings from our restructuring program. We are also making investments organically and inorganically to shift the portfolio towards higher growth, high return on capital areas. With a strong discipline against capital allocation and maximizing return on invested capital. An example of investment is in our delegated investment management business where we have added over 50 colleagues and deep research capabilities in our core strength areas of DB and DC while continue to invest and expand capabilities in broader asset pools like insurance, sovereign wealth funds in the nonprofit arena. This is driving double-digit organic growth through new client wins as well as driving significant inorganic growth with the acquisition of Townsend. Since inception, our AUM is growing from 0 to over 150 billion AUM, driven by strong performance, transparency fees and innovative solution for clients. Another example of investment is $950 million we invested in share repurchase in the first half of 2018. This remains the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon, given our valuation of Aon based on our free cash flow growth over time. In summary, acceleration in revenue growth, greater operating leverage and continued working capital improvements of $500 million over time give us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth. Double-digit free cash flow growth combined with a reduction in total shares outstanding will drive significant long-term shareholder value creation. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Sarah DeWitt: Hi, good morning, and thank you for the new format. Given your comments on the growth initiatives in Aon United, where do you see the long-term organic growth profile of the company over time? I mean, clearly a 4% organic growth year-to-date you’re growing faster than the global economy, but where do you see that spread headed over the long-term?
Gregory C. Case: So first of all, Sarah, I hope you like the format, love to get your comments, thoughts, if we can make it more helpful to you, but again we are trying to provide a little more perspective on sort of the long-term underpinning as sort of what's driving results. And this idea on Aon United is exactly at the core of what you're asking about. Aon United is growth for us. It really is about accelerating organic growth, that plus M&A we think is a very, very strong engine. And this idea of Aon United really fundamentally emanates from a client need, client view. They have talked to us about sort of how their needs are changing. They made it very clear when we bring our firm more effectively. It's very, very powerful. And if you think about that, we have done a number of things to reinforce this in an -- organically around the firm. Things like Aon Client Promise we have talked about or the Aon Impact model on how our colleagues conduct themselves. Things like articulating value, a whole series of things. But more recently, you have seen us take structural move. This is the new news. This is the news of the quarter, if you will, in terms of sort of how we're taking something we have done for a while and really accelerating it and it underpins organic growth. So we expect a continued progression. If you think about the last four years, 3%, 4%, and we have got momentum still building on that and we expect it to continue.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just the expense savings, you have done $250 million to date and you target $300 million for '18. So should we expect a meaningful slowdown in the savings in the back half of '18, or are you running ahead of schedule or should we think about that ultimate target of $450 million as maybe being conservative?
Christa Davies: Sarah, what we would say is where we’re up to year-to-date gives us a very strong confidence in being able to deliver the $300 million in savings in 2018 and the $450 million in savings in 2019. And so we're really pleased with the progress and confident about where we are up to year-to-date and we're not updating guidance for this year or next.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Kai Pan: Thank you and good morning. Thank you for the refreshing format. We are still adjusting to it. And the first question follow-up to Sarah's question, organic growth. You have seen acceleration. And could you tell us a little bit more about is -- has the macro environment help you on that? And going forward, is your growth acceleration depend on macro environment improving further from here, or it's a self driven story?
Gregory C. Case: Look, Kai, as we’ve said before, listen, our strategy, our approach is not to rely on market condition. Our approach is to rely on client needs and to address and to deliver on client need. And you have seen us consistently do that quarter-after-quarter. And to Sarah's question, we now believe we have the mechanism in place to accelerate that. And what you saw in the quarter overall from a market standpoint, look, at the end of the day we still continue to see exposures are modestly positive, the impact from pricing on average flat. There are spikes in different places, but on average basically modest. So this isn't about the market per se, this is about what we're doing to gather --- win more clients, retain more with those clients, we call it rollover doing more with them, rollover. So from our standpoint, we're going to continue to build that profile. I just would note, you saw real moment in commercial risk, you saw real moment in the reinsurance world, in the health world, real moment in the retirement world in terms of what we're trying to do. And so for us, what we have in place is designed to drive organic growth. And what we do know for sure is client need around the world is substantial and continues to grow. And so while we may lead a number of these markets, the world that we live in and our set of competitors are massively underpenetrated. So we believe there is substantial opportunity irrespective of market conditions to drive organic growth.
Kai Pan: Okay. That's great. My second question is focusing on margin expansion. I hope you can comment on three particular points. Number one is, the 130 basis point margin expansion in the second quarter, mostly driven by the 160 basis point savings. Since not a lot sort of operating synergy or leverage, I should say, given that organic growth of 5%. Number -- the second item is that in the second half the cost saving, incremental cost saving will be much less than the first half. Does it mean that margin expansion would now be as strong? And the third item is you mentioned little bit in your prepared slides about drag from the recent merger acquisition, I hope you can give EBIT like figures around it.
Christa Davies: Kai, I will certainly try to answer all those questions. So let's start with the facts. We’re up 130 basis points in margin expansion in Q2 and we are up 200 basis points in a margin expansion year-to-date. In any quarter this moment and we would highlight a few underlying drivers such as restructuring and FX as you mentioned, and with these our margins in the core standpoint are up 50 basis points year-to-date, a little more in Q1 and a little less in Q2. That said, there are other impacts as you mentioned in the quarter. We have a minus 60 basis points impact from M&A and a minus 30 basis point impact from FX, and a minus 30 basis point impact from timing from E&O. And so we have got sort of substantial headwinds in the quarter in addition to the investments we're making in growth. And so it's -- while it's easy to strip out certain items in and out of the quarter, we do manage margins overall for the year and that's why we feel very strongly about our margin expansion year-to-date at 200 basis points, and it gives us confidence at our full-year margin expansion and as you described leading to margin expansion in 2019 and beyond. And so, 2018 margin expansion will be driven by accelerating organic revenue growth, mix shift and operating leverage, both coming from restructuring and productivity.
Kai Pan: Okay. Thank you for the detail. Last one, if I may, in the spirit of your new model. You also mentioned potentially inviting the business leader to this conversation. I don’t know if Eric or Michael is on the phone, so I would like to ask them what has changed into the day-to-day operation under the new model compared with the quarter's ago? And any potential -- you talk about the benefit, I just wonder is there potential drawback or downside risk to -- in the sort of implementation of the new model?
Gregory C. Case: So, Kai, they’re not on the call today, but what we will do next is to tee up. We will actually start the call next time on sort of operational implications of Aon United. Eric and Michael comment on those directly sort of all the things that are happening in the marketplace, sort of on a positive way and sort of how they’re leading and managing that and how it's coming through. I think what you're going to find is you talk to them is the opportunity here is so substantial. Again, the client need is great. This is all driven on client need and when our colleagues get around the table and talk about client issues, and those colleague has come from the full complement or capability we’ve got, we create all kinds of possibilities. And even when there is not a commercial outcome, the client thinks about us differently. So fundamentally when we deliver Aon United capability, client perception changes and economics change, growth changes. So I think you're going to hear a lot about that. They can also talk a little bit about sort of the Aon Operating Committee they pull together, that really gives us a chance to sort of think about Aon United types of decisions in a way we have never done before. So a lot of momentum on this. And what we are excited about, I think you will hear it in their conversation is again we worked this for a decade on a number of different things we have done to create the conditions. Now we are taking structural change. Now we are doing things like the Aon Operating Committee, like the co-presidents, like the single P&L, like the single brand. These are things we have never done before that we believe will accelerate a proven concept and drive organic growth. So I agree with you. There will be two highlights, Eric and Mike for the next call.
Q - Kai Pan: That would be great. Look forward to it.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Yaron, your line is now open.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning. First question I just want to, I guess it's more of a clarification point. Christa, the 30 basis points in E&O timing and 60 basis points in M&A drags on the margins, were those year-to-date or for the quarter?
Christa Davies: It was for the quarter, Yaron.
Yaron Kinar: Okay, got it. And then if you look at the second half of this year, you're running up against maybe tougher organic growth comps. You highlighted FX, there's a potential drag as well as currency remains as is. Do you think that -- is margin improvement achievable ex restructuring phase?
Christa Davies: Yes, it is, Yaron. So what I would say is as we look at the full-year 2018 and the second half, we are going to drive margin expansion through organic growth, continued investment in M&A, mix shift across the portfolio as we continue to invest in higher growth, higher margin areas. The operational leverage we're getting in our business both from restructuring and the productivity we are getting from the Aon United operating model.
Gregory C. Case: And I would say, overall, Yaron, sort of we are continuing to build momentum sort of on the organic growth side. If you think about sort of where we’ve come in the first half of the year, very, very positive. The second half, we think we will have continued progress. There are a couple of categories, the reinsurance 8% sort of in the quarter when we have done for the first half. We are also going to be -- by the way up against a high comp in the second half. We also had some events that happened sort of last year that may or may not happen. Assuming they don't happen, there obviously be some -- there will be a little bit of a headwind to get some of those comps. But frankly we are going to continue to push and build momentum there. On data analytics, on the other side of the equation were negative for the quarter as you see when we talked about its due to a single incident and we expect the second half to be more positive. So there are lots of puts and takes through the course of the year, but you can expect us to continue build momentum sort of on the organic growth side.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And Christa you highlighted M&A as potential source of margin improvement in the second half, is that just the timing of the M&A that’s already come in that now becomes accretive or are there other elements there?
Christa Davies: Yes. So what I would say is look I wouldn’t over [indiscernible] on M&A in anyone quarter. I would say over the course of the year, we expect investments we are making organically and inorganically in the business to contribute to margin expansion.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And maybe one last quick one. The $7.97 target, EPS target, is that still in place even with the potential pressures from currency?
Christa Davies: It certainly is, Yaron. So we feel really confident about exceeding $7.97 for 2018, driven by core performance, restructuring savings, the returns on the investments we have made in M&A and allocation of capital.
Yaron Kinar: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Adam, your line is now open.
Adam Klauber: Good morning, everyone. Free cash flow, I believe peaked in 2016 around $2.1 billion. Do you think you will get back there by 2019, just roughly, an outlook for guidance? And then, once you hit that core rate, again, will growth of free cash flow be higher than EPS or more in line with operating earnings?
Christa Davies: Yes. So, Adam, what I would say is we are not giving new cash flow target. What we have said is we are going to drive free cash flow on a double-digit basis. You can see that on underlying basis year-to-date of 17%, which we’re very pleased with. And what you have seen and you will see in calendar year 2018 is we’re at a peak year of restructuring cash usage. So you will see free cash flow on a reported basis accelerate in 2019 and that reported and adjusted free cash flow will start to come together in 2019 as the restructuring cash outlay winds down. As we think about free cash flow growth the longer term, you’re really going to have operating income growth plus improvements in working capital. We really outlined about $500 million of working capital primarily receivable sitting in our balance sheet, that we will free up over the next couple of years that will contribute to strong cash flow growth and strong double-digit great cash flow growth combined with the reduction in shares will dramatically increase free cash flow per share over time.
Adam Klauber: Thanks. And how should we think about, again, looking a bit more forward not look for guidance, but how should we think about CapEx and pension? Will they be positive and negative for free cash over the next couple of years?
Christa Davies: So, we have given specific guidance on CapEx. And what we have said is CapEx is elevated in the current year and next due to the restructuring program and that is coming down and then pension is also coming down over time.
Adam Klauber: Okay. And then just a follow-up on health solutions. A good quarter, I think you mentioned that, there were strong growth in the U.S. What, I guess -- what was driving the U.S growth?
Gregory C. Case: Again, Adam, step back and essentially think about sort of what we have done, as we described in the first quarter, we just have continued momentum in the first half of the year across all aspects of the business. Certainly like to benefit sort of the work the team has done around the world, terrific. In H&B, the work the team has done is terrific, but really across the board sort of in the exchange businesses as well. So it just continuing momentum on the health side. So the -- if you sort of think about what we have done historically sort of in health for the year, last year at 7%, we ended the quarter as you see, 7%. So you’re just seeing the momentum overall. It really is performance across the board.
Adam Klauber: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer, your line is now open.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks. Greg, I don't want to over analyze the comments you made with regards to the hospital strategic discussion, but am I right to think that having a strategy consultancy something like Mackenzie within the portfolio of Aon companies would make those conversation more robust?
Gregory C. Case: Listen, Meyer, this is -- this -- I would also don't want to overplay. This is one example I pulled out sort of a last week example. Our team is bringing solutions. So forget sort of the traditional kind of strategic consulting firms, full respect to them, but our team is bringing solutions. They not only bought a diagnosis of the situation, which frankly open the eyes of the client, they brought a way to actually enable the client's strategy. And in this case, my gosh, without that there is a lot more risk in the process. So we have moved very much sort of around -- sort of a solution approach. You combine that with our data and analytics, we have in each one of the categories, we will bring to bear a set of -- the ammunition is amazing. It is always been amazing out there sort of the capability we have got in the data analytics on the commercial side, on the reinsurance, on the retirement side, on the health side, we have just got an incredible platform to sort of draw from. And what we have done before is taken that platform and pull it together and brought it and put it in front of the clients in a thoughtful way. Aon Client Promise gave us, Meyer, the basis of how much we can do that. It's a systematic way, we listen to clients, understand their needs, and react to those. And what we're doing is now breaking down structural barriers and make it easier for our colleagues to come together and talk about clients. And we just -- there is another example I could use, which is European headquartered, multinational building products company. You would know it very, very well and frankly had a very good relationship with them on the risk side, but they are under some real pressure from a performance standpoint. Our team brought together a full complement of folks from across our solution lines and came up with sort of whole way for them to think about their benefits for their colleagues, for their employees, and did it in a way that we believe will increase engagement. And it was a 50, 60 country answer. The client never would have thought about it and for god sake never would have thought anybody could execute it until we sat around the table, we got up 10 passports, talking about what we can bring to the table, from 10 different countries, I mean. And so, there is just so much opportunity and it's -- in so many respects, Meyer, it's so obvious and so clear, but doggone hard to execute. You’re getting colleagues to sort of work together in ways they haven't before, bringing expertise in a more integrated way and we have to break down the barriers to do that. And as I said, we have proven this works exceptionally well. We have done it in one-off different situations. Now the new news, which you're hearing is, we're taking various structural steps to make it easier for our colleagues to do this. And the beauty is when it happens, it doesn't have too result as I said before, in commercial gratification immediately. This is changing the dialogue with clients. Our colleagues love doing that. It's reinforcing, it's contagious. It's in fact -- it's a wonderful sort of outcome. And so, all the capability, ours is that we have the leadership will to make it happen, and that's what we are excited about.
Q - Meyer Shields: Okay. Now, that's very helpful. Thanks. Two other quick questions. One, has the year-to-date results in organic fully reflect the strong acquisition activity last year. And Christa, could you identify the individual service lines that are most exposed to the FX headwinds on second-half revenues?
Christa Davies: Yes. So, Meyer, the first thing I would say yes the M&A impact from last year does not impact organic. It adds to organic and so it doesn't reflect. And if you think about the M&A we did in 2017, most of it was in Q4. And so what you will -- what's showing up in organic this year is not M&A related to last year. There may be some portion of it that shows up in Q4, but some of the acquisitions were done in December Q4. So very little will show up this year. And then as we think about sort of the FX, we don't really break out the impact by solution lines, but it's fair to say we do have a local revenue and expenses in 120 countries. And so we generally prefer a weaker U.S dollar. And the big exception to that for us, Meyer, is the pound, but what you’re seeing I think in the FX headwind in Q3 and Q4 is primarily related to Latin America.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is now open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Good morning. My first question on just a numbers question. There was about a $103 million of legacy litigation that you guys pulled out of our adjusted earnings in the quarter. Can we just get a little bit more color what did that stem from? And is that something that we should think about impacting your earnings going forward?
Christa Davies: Yes. So, Elyse, what we would say is we can't discuss the specific litigation. But one other things you should get comfort from is we have taken a number of steps over time to reduce volatility at Aon. We have put in place limits of liabilities. We've purchased additional insurance and what you will see when we file our Q later today is that we’ve decreased the estimated losses related to disclosed litigation from $300 million to $100 million as a result of the actions we are taking. And so we're dramatically reducing really legacy litigation as we continue to take steps to drive growth across the firm.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then in terms of maybe a follow-up question on the margin side of things. You highlighted this quarter was impacted by 60 basis points from M&A and 30 basis points from currency to give us about the recent hit for the next couple of quarters. How do we think about currency, I guess, the margin impact on a quarterly basis implied by that? And then also you -- based on your commentary it seems like the drag from M&A will get better over the next couple of quarters? I'm just trying to tie together those numbers.
Christa Davies: Sure. So the first thing I would say, Elyse, is we don't give guidance on the FX impact on margin. It's frankly pretty difficult to predict. But what we can say is that on an EPS basis, we expect $0.03 impact in Q3 and a $0.03 impact in Q4, primarily driven by Latin America. And then what we would say is we did have an impact as you mentioned, minus 60 basis points from M&A in Q2. We would expect over the course of the year for that to neutralize. I think we have spoken previously when you do M&A, the first year of integration is largely a negative impact on margin. And so, as you integrate the business and then longer term, it for sure drives margin expansion, because we are investing in high revenue growth, high margin area. So I hope that helps.
Elyse Greenspan: Yes. That's helpful. And then in terms of on the organic growth side, would you say I guess, it seems like other than the one-off that you called out on the data side that the quarter probably represents more or less a run rate level. I guess aside from maybe some of the headwinds on the reinsurance side and is that how we can kind of think about the growth level being sustained over the balance of the year? And just based off, how you guys see exposures in pricing and your ability to generate new business? How would you think about the organic growth outlook for 2019 as well? Do you have a kind of initial view at this point?
Gregory C. Case: Elyse, as you know, we don't give specific guidance on sort of the growth profile and what it is going look like what you have seen it and fully agree with you on, so the quarters will be variable when you sort of saw things move around in the quarter. But over the course of the year, the first six months, it really is about continued momentum. And our goal each year is to sort of continue to build momentum. We have the structure in place to do that, the investments in place to do that. And that's really what we intend to do for '18 and into '19 and into '20. I want to emphasize again that for us this is not about pricing, this is really about what we do in the marketplace on behalf of clients to drive long-term value. That's going to be the driver of growth for us by far and sort of pricing and insured value sort of are important to understand, but are not going to be the drivers for us. And so you will see our anticipation is continuing momentum on the growth side in '18 and in '19.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then one last question. One of your peers saw a slowdown in their defined benefits on consulting business. You obviously don't break out that line items. I'm not sure how much detail you want to go into, but are you just -- is that -- are you observing a slowdown in that business? Any color you can give us, and I'm assuming it's absorbed by growth within other area of your retirement business, if you're seeing that?
Gregory C. Case: Well, listen, overall when you think about sort of the retirement piece, elements of this business are growing, elements are not growing, what we do know for sure back to the client orientation is that when you think about sort of retirements in the world today, roughly 20% of the population's prepared for retirement. Our companies, our clients are sort of dealing with that every day. It's becoming increasingly difficult for them to actually help their employees think about how they can deal with retirement. So we are bringing to bear as best we can, a full complement of ideas and perspectives to help them sort retirement. And we think that’s a major sort of opportunities long-term. Certainly elements within that will be positive and negative, but our view overall, but Christa thoughts on that?
Christa Davies: Yes. So, but I would say, Elyse, is our results actually reflect solid growth in our core actuary retirement business. So we are very pleased we got a fantastic team serving clients. And it's driven by an increase in volume and rates across North America and EMEA. We're really helping clients solve a lot of pension issues around derisking, taking risk off the table, given interest rates j risen. And so there is a lot of opportunities for us to do that with clients and we are very pleased with the progress we are making to date. And, Elyse, it reflects a lot of other things that we're doing in our own pension plan at Aon as we continue to take risk off the table as you've seen, given the rise in interest rates and the ability to do that in the marketplace today.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill + Partners. Paul, your line is now open.
Paul Newsome: Good morning. The only question I really had was, I would like to if you would dive a little bit more into the organic growth for the reinsurance segment. And it seems like and tell me if I'm wrong that pricing is a little weak, but customers maybe buying more. What I don't know is whether or not there is actually a change in market share amongst the brokers themselves?
Gregory C. Case: Listen, Paul, let me step and we would say overall market conditions are -- continued to be if you’re going to think about this from a one standpoint, challenge from the stand -- there is plenty of capital out there, lots of opportunity to serve our clients on that beyond -- on behalf. But if you look at our fundamental results on the reinsurance side, they continuous to be the basics. It is success in treaty, its success in fact, it success in insurance length securities, it's across the board. By the way it's another quarter of net new business win for us when you think about where we are. The data analytics, our team has is, its exceptional and just reflect back, a few years ago on these calls, everyone was asking about what about growth, what about growth, I just would just remind you there was a time when you literally were talking to the number one place in the world on treaty and basically property with 6% of the revenues and by the way a big chunk of that was in the U.S and those prices were down massively, and we are still net new wins. And so all those fundamentals are sort of in place and have been for a couple of years and continue to build and sort of you're seeing that result. And again, I would say obviously the result for the quarter is exceptional. We would ask you to sort of think about over the course of the year and our view is it's just reflects on 2018 versus 2017 versus 2016 and reinsurance you're going to see momentum.
Paul Newsome: Greg, thanks. Congrats on the quarter.
Gregory C. Case: Thanks.
Operator: Our last question is coming from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Kai, your line is now open.
Kai Pan: Thank you. I have two more follow-ups. Number one on the buybacks. It looks like year-to-date you bought back a nice $50 million dividends like close to 100, and the acquisition probably about $50 million, so together $1.2 billion outlay. If you look at free cash flow including the restructuring charge $300 million and you’ve seem to raise a little bit short-term debt like $500 million. So I just wonder compared to those source of cash and use of cash, do you see that buyback has to slowdown in the back half of the year or -- and that the free cash flow coming in or you have additional room for the leverage?
Christa Davies: Yes. So, Kai, it's a great question. And what we would say is as we think about cash flow over the course of the year, our strongest cash flow quarters have always been Q3 and Q4 and that remains true. So as you think about cash in second half of the year, it will be stronger in terms of just cash flow from operations. And then as we think about uses of cash, obviously, as we allocate cash to different activities, we are going to do it based on ROIC. And so what you're going to see is we will continue to allocate cash to buyback, because it remains our highest return on capital opportunity across the firm. You will see us continue to invest in M&A and organically as the return on capital opportunities are substantial. And then you did see us increase leverage slightly and we return to 2016 levels over the course of time. And then what you will see on debt really is as EBITDA grows we will continue to add debt, keeping our leverage ratio aligned.
Kai Pan: Okay. My last one is back to the full-year guidance, $7.97. If you step back to the beginning of the year when you first sort of gave out the guidance, and you now seems like there is a little bit benefit about $0.06 that benefits from foreign exchange and also about $0.10 benefit from the lower overall tax rate. So why you’re not -- full-year guidance, why not be like 2% higher? Am I reading too much into it?
Christa Davies: Yes. Well I would say, Kai, we don’t normally give guidance. When we announced the transaction in May 2017, that drove amazing benefits to shareholders, left Aon with a portfolio with higher revenue growth, higher margin, higher return on capital and a terrific cash benefit to shareholders, $3 billion. We really at that point in time, May last year, wanted to be clear that we would exceed EPS guidance for 2018. EPS is up 28% year-to-date and we feel confident about exceeding the $7.97 for 2018 and we're not updating guidance.
Kai Pan: Okay, great. Thank you so much and good luck.
Operator: We have one last follow-up question in queue from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Yaron, your line is now open.
Yaron Kinar: Hi. Sorry for fixating on this, but I want to go back to M&A for a second. So, Christa, if I understand your comments correctly, basically you’re going to get some lift as you’re integrating some of the previous acquisitions and getting them into higher margins. But if we expect an overall lift in margins for the second half of the year, doesn't also mean that you are not getting as much of new M&A revenues coming in the door in the second half of the year that would offset the lift that you’re getting from previous M&A?
Christa Davies: Yaron, I think you are hoping for a level of guidance on M&A that we are probably just not going to give. What I would say overall is as we think about M&A, the first year M&A integration is largely negative on margins, you saw that particularly show in Q2. Over the course of the full-year, it will be a little less than what you saw in Q2. And then over time what you see is M&A from previous years, example 2016 starts to contribute to margins, and so you have a mix shift going on. Of course, we are investing in higher margins businesses, in the businesses we bring into the firm, so that will contribute positively to margin over time. The last thing I would say on margins is, we do expect -- we are up 200 basis points year-to-date in margins. We expect margin expansion in the second half of the year to contribute to $7.97 exceeding EPS guidance for the year.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case: Just want to say, on behalf of Christa, I appreciate everybody being part of the call today. As we said at the beginning, we took a bit different approach today, different format, trying to give you a view which sort of highlight some of the long-term efforts we’re taking or efforts that we think will impact the long-term success of the firm. So hopefully you found it helpful. If you have thoughts or comments or other ways we could sort of do this or create this kind of perspective, let us know. But really appreciate being part of the call today and look forward to our conversation next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: And that concludes today’s conference. Thank you, all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-05-04 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc Christa Davies - Aon Plc

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2018 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Thanks very much, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. For your reference, I'd note that there are slides available on our website to follow along with our commentary today. Before we discuss the financial results of the quarter, I'd like to reflect on Aon overall on our decade-long mission to be the leading global professional services firm, delivering a broad range of risk, Retirement and Health Solutions, enabled by proprietary data and analytics. We have taken significant steps to evolve into the firm you see today. As you know, nearly a year ago, we completed the divestiture of our outsourcing platform, a meaningful acceleration of our proven strategy. The divestiture was just one step in our journey, but it was a step that provided a further catalyst for our actions to unlock the next wave of shareholder value, as it reinforces our focus as a professional services firm; further aligns Aon's portfolio around our clients' highest priorities; generates significant capital to accelerate investment in innovation and emerging client needs; provides a catalyst to unite our firm under one operating model, creating greater efficiency and operating leverage; and reinforces our return on invested capital, decision-making priority and emphasis on delivering double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term. Our optimism is built through our conviction that these actions will substantially strengthen our firm on the heels of a decade of industry-leading improvement and innovation for our clients and shareholders. With this momentum, we're already seeing improvement in our growth profile to provide new investment in high growth, high margin areas across our portfolio. Organic revenue has increased from 3% in both 2014 and 2015 to 4% in 2016 and 2017. Our journey continues, as we focus on driving greater innovation and more insightful content to deliver improved outcomes on behalf of our clients. Stronger growth, combined with increased operating leverage and free cash flow margin, reinforces our long-term outlook and the significant upside we anticipate in the value of our firm over the coming years. Now turning to the quarter on page 5 of the presentation. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First, our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second, overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment. I would also note that the financial results discussed on today's conference call and shown in the presentation slides, are all on a comparable basis year-over-year, adjusting 2017 results retrospectively to pro forma amounts which include the impact of the revenue recognition accounting change that was formally adopted as of the first quarter 2018. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver double-digit free cash flow growth. In the first quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, driven by strong growth in Reinsurance and Commercial Risk Solutions. Also noting double-digit growth overall in total revenue. Operating margin increased 230 basis points and operating income increased 22%, primarily reflecting savings from investments in our Aon United operating model and core operational improvement. EPS increased 26% to $2.97, reflecting both strong operating performance and effective capital management, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. And finally, adjusted free cash flow increased $28 million or 16% when excluding the near-term impacts resulting from the divestiture, primarily reflecting strong operational improvement. Overall, a strong start to the year with positive performance across each of our key metrics in what is now our seasonally largest quarter. Turning to slide 7, on the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments. Reported revenue growth in the first quarter increased 13% year-over-year or 8% excluding favorable FX translation, which is an acceleration above historical levels of 6%. Organic revenue growth was 3% overall in the first quarter, driven by strong growth in both Reinsurance and Commercial Risk Solutions. Reflecting on each of our core growth platforms. In Commercial Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 4%, an acceleration from 2% in the prior-year quarter. On average globally, exposures were modestly positive and the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulting in a relatively stable market impact overall. We saw solid growth globally across most geographies, driven by more than $200 million of total new business generation and strong management of our renewal book portfolio. Results reflect strong growth across the Americas including double digit growth in both Canada and Latin America, as well as particular strength in U.S. retail, driven by a 17% increase in new business generation. Internationally, growth was driven by strength in the EMEA region, again, highlighted by substantial new business generation, up 26% versus the prior year. Finally, total revenue growth excluding favorable FX increased 14%, driven by the inclusion of our UMG and Henderson acquisitions in EMEA. In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 6%, an acceleration from 4% in the prior year quarter, a really strong performance on what is now our seasonally largest quarter for Reinsurance. Market impact was modestly positive on results in the quarter reflecting both a continuation of moderating pricing and modest upward pressure in loss-exposed geographies, partially offset by clients adjusting their buying behavior as industry pricing fluctuates. Results reflect strong growth across every major category, again, this quarter including treaty, facultative, and capital markets transactions. We saw particular strength in treaty placements, driven by another quarter of net new business generation. Looking ahead for Reinsurance, we would remind you of the strong second half comparable for 2018, as 2017 benefited from a higher than normal catastrophe season and capital markets activity albeit what are now our seasonally smallest quarters. In Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was flat compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect solid growth in investment consulting, including continued double-digit growth in delegated investment management solutions, reflecting an increasing client demand for Aon's tailored solutions and objective advice. We also saw a growth in our talent rewards and performance practice for assessment services, an area of recent M&A investment. Results were offset by a modest decline in project-related work and an unfavorable impact from timing of certain revenue into future quarters in the talent practice. In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was flat against a strong comparable of 15% in the prior year quarter. We saw solid growth in health and benefits brokerage, highlighted by particular strength internationally across Asia and EMEA regions to provide strong management of the renewal book portfolio. We also saw solid growth in the U.S., with double-digit growth in voluntary benefits, an area we have seen increasing client demand as employers look to tailor their benefit strategies to offer their employees cost-effective options outside of traditional coverage. Results in the quarter were unfavorably impacted by certain project-related work that benefited the prior year quarter in our health care exchange business. In Data & Analytic Services, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 6% in the prior year quarter. We saw continued growth in our core Affinity business with particular strength in the U.S. and EMEA. Results in the quarter were offset by an anticipated unfavorable impact from changes in certain client contracts, most notably the transition of a certain government contract in our flood business. Overall, a strong start to the year despite some quarterly noise due to timing and tough prior year comparables. Driven by an improved portfolio of mix and significant investment in high growth areas, we continue to position the firm for improved long-term growth. Turning to slide 8 to discuss areas of strategic investment, clients continue to navigate an increasingly volatile world with natural disasters combined with economic, demographic, geopolitical forces and the exponential pace of technology change, all converging to create a challenging new reality for businesses. Aon has a strong track record of allocating capital to developing innovative first-to-market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs. These strategic investments in high growth areas, driven by our ROIC decision-making process are improving the firm's long-term growth profile and increasing operating leverage across the portfolio. We're investing organically and through M&A across the portfolio in areas such as Data & Analytics, deliver better client outcomes through content-driven insight; cyber risk advisory, expanding on the acquisition of Stroz Friedberg; health and elective benefits brokerage, as global employers are increasingly focused on improving their overall benefits packages; healthcare exchanges where we offer the broadest set of solutions and help, geographically, with the recent acquisitions of UMG and Henderson, reinforcing our industry-leading position in EMEA; and, finally, in delegated investment management solutions, a business with rapidly growing client demand with the recent acquisition of the Townsend Group, bringing a greater depth of expertise in real estate assets to our distribution scale, and increasing our ability to provide alternative private market assets. In summary, results in the first quarter represent a strong start to the year, with significant double-digit growth across revenue, operating income, earnings per share, and adjusted free cash flow. We believe our unmatched level of investment in content, in client-serving capabilities, combined with improved operational performance through our Aon United operating model and effective capital management place us on track to exceed $7.97 of earnings per share in 2018 and, more important, unlock significant shareholder value through double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect positive performance across each of our key metrics, highlighted by strong organic revenue growth in Commercial Risk and Reinsurance Solutions, substantial operational improvement and double-digit growth in adjusted free cash flow. We are continuing to drive efficiencies in our operating model and allocate capital to the highest return opportunities. As Greg previously highlighted, the financials discussed on today's conference call and shown in the presentation slides are all on a comparable basis year-over-year, adjusting 2017 results retrospectively to pro forma amounts that include the impact of the revenue recognition accounting change that was formally adopted as of the first quarter 2018. Please refer to pages 11 to 15 of the press release schedules for financials that provide a comparable year-over-year view. And similar to last year, we've provided nine quarters of comparable financials in Excel format on our Investor Relations website. Turning to slide 10 of the presentation, our core EPS from continuing operations excluding certain items increased 26% to $2.97 per share for the first quarter compared to $2.35 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 11 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization, non-cash restructuring charges and non-cash expenses related to pension settlement. Results included a net $0.12 per share favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and certain hedging programs, including a $0.19 per share favorable impact from FX translation, primarily driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus the euro, partially offset by a $0.03 per share loss on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, recognizing other expense; and lastly, the prior year quarter benefited from a $12 million or $0.04 per share reduction in expenses related to certain hedging programs. If currency were to (13:50) remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect foreign currency translation to have an immaterial impact in the second quarter and the remainder of 2018. Lastly, included in the results was a $7 million or minus $0.02 unfavorable impact from losses on certain long-term investments recognized through other expense. Turning to the next slide to discuss our strong operational performance. Operating income increased 22% and operating margin improved 230 basis points to 31.8% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating margin improvement primarily reflects 160 basis points of savings from restructuring initiatives and other operational improvements before any reinvestment and 90 basis points of core improvement. This was partially offset by a minus 20 basis point net unfavorable impact from FX translation and certain hedging programs. From a dollar standpoint, operating income increased $174 million, with $52 million driven by incremental savings before reinvestment and $45 million of net favorable impact from FX translation and certain hedging programs. The remaining $77 million or 10% growth year-over-year was driven by solid organic revenue growth and core operational improvement, a strong start to the year operationally as we continue to execute against our multiyear investment in the firm and improve on invested capital across the portfolio. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the investments we're making to create our next-generation global business services model that allows a better scalability, flexibility, and enhanced colleague and client experience. These investments are intended to create one operating model with increased operating leverage. Our primary investment areas are across IT, real estate, and people. In IT, we expect to create greater insight from data center optimization, application management, and strategic vendor consolidation. In real estate, we expect to drive greater collaboration and engagement through real estate portfolio optimization. And in people, we expect to create scalable and efficient operations using centers of excellence and third-party providers. As part of these operating model investments, we expect to invest an estimated $1.17 billion in total cash over the three-year program from 2017 through 2019. These investments include an estimated $975 million of cash charges. We incurred $497 million of expense and spent $280 million of cash in 2017. Future cash outlay is expected to increase modestly in 2018 then expected to decline each year thereafter. And an estimated $200 million of incremental capital expenditure investment with $27 million incurred in 2017, approximately $100 million expected in 2018, and $70 million expected in 2019. There is an additional estimated $50 million of noncash charges included as part of asset impairments. Overall, we expect these investments and other expense discipline initiatives to deliver $450 million of estimated annual savings in 2019 before any potential reinvestment. Further, we have been deploying the balance of the proceeds from the sale of our outsourcing business to the highest return on capital opportunities, including investments in high-growth, high-margin areas across our portfolio and direct return to shareholders through share repurchase. Turning to the next page. In the first quarter, we incurred $74 million of restructuring related charges compared to $144 million in the prior year quarter, primarily relating to workforce reduction and other general initiatives. Since inception, we've incurred $571 million of restructuring-related charges representing 56% of the updated total program estimates. The cash impact in the first quarter was an outflow of $98 million, compared to $31 million in the prior-year quarter. We also incurred $15 million of additional capital expenditure compared to $1 million in the prior-year quarter. We recognized $63 million of savings in the first quarter compared to $11 million in the prior-year quarter, and $228 million of savings since inception of the program, representing 51% of the expected $450 million total program savings. Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of operations on slide 14. Interest income increased $2 million to $4 million, reflecting additional income earned on modestly higher cash balances compared to the prior year quarter. Interest expense was similar at $70 million. Pension income increased $1 million to $9 million. As noted at yearend, beginning in Q1 of 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard that shifted the financial components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit costs from above the line in compensation and benefit expense to below the line as part of other income expense. Other expense of $17 million primarily includes $10 million or minus $0.03 of losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, as well as $7 million or minus $0.02 of losses on certain long-term investments. Based on current assumptions, we believe that approximately $10 million per quarter is the right run rate to model for other income expense in 2018, primarily related to pension income, excluding all other items we do not forecast that could be favorable or unfavorable in any given period. Turning to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, increased to 16.5% compared to 13.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by changes in geographic distribution of income as well as various impacts relating from U.S. tax reform. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods included a net favorable impact from certain discrete items, primarily relating to share-based compensation. We continue to believe the best estimate of our full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate is approximately 19% based on current interpretation of changes in U.S. legislation, assumptions of geographic mix of income, and impact of discrete items. Lastly, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 6% to 250.2 million in the first quarter compared to 267 million in the prior quarter, as we continue to effectively allocate capital including the repurchase of 3.9 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $550 million in the first quarter. The company has approximately $4.9 billion of remaining authorization under its share purchase program. Actual shares outstanding on March 31 were 245.2 million and there are approximately 4 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2018 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 249 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. Now, let me turn to the next slide to discuss our solid balance sheet and financial flexibility. At March 31, 2018, cash and short-term investments decreased to $715 million. Total debt outstanding increased modestly to $6.1 billion, and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis for continuing operations decreased to 2.6 times. As discussed previously, while debt to EBITDA will be initially elevated as a result of the sale of our outsourcing business, we expect to return back to the 2 to 2.5 times range by the end of 2018, driven by operational improvement. Reported cash from operations for the first three months of 2018 decreased $42 million to $140 million, primarily driven by $67 million of incremental cash restructuring charges partially offset by operational improvement. Excluding certain near-term impacts resulting from the divestiture, including restructuring initiatives, adjusted free cash flow increased $28 million or 16%. Adjusted free cash flow growth was primarily driven by strong operational performance in the quarter. A reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow to reported cash flow from operations is provided in Appendix E of this presentation. As cash outlays from near-term restructuring initiatives wind down in 2019 and beyond, we would expect adjusted free cash flow to converge with reported free cash flow. The new revenue recognition accounting change did not have an impact on total cash flow or free cash flow. Appendix F of the presentation provides a pro forma comparable view of cash flow from operations for the prior year showing that cash flow is completely unaffected by the revenue recognition accounting change. Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the long term, we value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. This disciplined capital management approach is focused on a decision-making process that maximizes return on invested capital, which we have consistently improved each year since 2010, increasing 610 basis points to 17.8% in 2017. We've also taken significant steps to maximize the translation of each dollar of revenue into the highest amount of free cash flow, including working capital initiatives and actions to manage our cash pension contributions. Since 2010, we've increased our free cash flow margin by nearly 1,000 basis points. In 2017, our free cash flow margin on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of the divestiture, was 17.8%. Looking forward, we expect two main drivers to continue to contribute to incremental free cash flow generation. The first is continued operational improvement, driven by accelerating organic revenue growth and further margin expansion. The second is working capital improvement, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We expect working capital to contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long term. In summary, performance in the first quarter reflects a strong start to the year and continued progress against the actions we're taking to strengthen the firm. We believe that accelerating revenue growth and continued operational improvement, combined with significant financial flexibility and strong adjusted free cash flow generation, position the firm to deliver on our near-term goal of exceeding $7.97 adjusted earnings per share in 2018. As Greg noted, we're excited about the long-term outlook and our ability to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth, combined with an expected reduction in total shares outstanding, representing substantial upside and what we believe is the next significant value creation opportunity for shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Our first question will come from Dave Styblo of Jefferies. You have an open line.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Hi, there. Good Morning, and happy Friday, guys.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Same to you. Thanks.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Wanted to just come back to slide 11. I don't think I'm quite triangulating the math quite right on the margin expansion year-over-year. So, it's apples-to-apples, you're up 230 basis points on operating margin; 160 basis points of that is from the restructuring savings. And then, I think the FX, well, it had a drag of 20 basis points. So that would have made it – that accounts for another 20 basis points. So, is the difference there of your operating margin – you know what? I think I've actually just solved my own question. Sorry about that. (26:16)
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So, you've got 90 basis points of margin expansion from the core, Dave.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Yeah, yeah.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Does that make sense? Yeah.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. I missed that last point there. Okay. So that's self-explanatory. As far as, as you go forward for the rest of the year and your outlook on organic growth, I know, you guys don't typically give guidance. You started the year at 3% here and you do have some tough comps in Reinsurance for the back half of the year. Management's goal has been to continue to accelerate organic growth over the next couple years here. Is that going to be hard to do this year, just given the dynamics from 2017, or do you guys already have visibility on some areas of new business wins that give you confidence that you can at least match last year's 4% or possibly even move it higher?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Yes. David, our message is consistent. But while there's a little bit of noise back and forth on the different revenue lines in the quarter, when we think about the year in 2018 and beyond 2018, we think this quarter – we view this quarter as just another quarter of on-track progression. So, if you go back and think about sort of our investments in higher margin, higher growth areas, historically, go back a few years ago, we're at kind of 3%, 3%. The last two years, we're at 4%, 4%; again, on track, sort of to continue that progress. And if you think about sort of what happened in the quarter, 13% reported, take out the FX, we're at 8% – by the way that 8% is higher than our 10-year average reported, which is at 6%. So from our standpoint, this quarter is just another step on a progression for organic growth, margin improvement and, as Christa importantly pointed out, free cash flow growth improvement.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then, more broadly, as you look across your portfolio in terms of maybe a matrix of both geographies and product lines or solutions, can you talk a little bit more about market share upside potential and margin expansion headroom? I'm just trying to get a sense if you're maxed out in some countries or solutions. And similarly, what areas of your business are perhaps underperforming, not quite at targets, where you see opportunity, other than the things that you're doing with the BPO cost savings?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Well, let's come back again, I'll sort of point you back to – I'll talk about sort of top line, and Christa maybe can comment on the margin piece a little bit as well. Listen, one of the things that we're excited about, we talked a year ago about the divestiture of our outsourcing business, which was yet another catalyst for the next step in the progression of Aon, both to reinforce our work as a professional services firm, it also reinforce strongly our ability to continue to bring together Aon United, how we deliver our global firm to our clients in a local way. And that means we can invest more and more in a single operating platform, a single P&L. All these things are driving greater operating leverage and are fueling the performance improvement, the operating margin improvement you're seeing. And then what we also did is broke out the five revenue lines. You could really see we're making investments and we like the opportunities across all five of the lines. In particular, areas to create net new demand. So if you think about in Commercial Risk, what we're doing in cyber to change the game in cyber, to create net new demand, real set of opportunities. In Reinsurance, we see tremendous opportunities to create net new demand with what is a truly industry-leading leadership teams. So think about what we just did or have done historically in the U.S. mortgage world in which we created net new demand in the U.S. mortgage world to the tune of $10 billion in premium. You saw us just place what is a very, very unique cat bond in the marketplace. First of its kind, for the World Bank for four countries who face quake risk they couldn't recover from in prior periods. So, these are real innovations, sort of, in Reinsurance. You're seeing the same on the Retirement side, in what we're doing with delegated, on the Health side, in what we're doing with the exchanges. And then very excited about what we're doing with Data & Analytics to, again, create areas of net new demand. So, for us, Dave, we really did see the sale of the outsourcing business as a real catalyst. And what you see in the first quarter is just the continued progress against that. But in terms of margin, Christa, anything you'd add to that?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yeah. The thing I'd say, Dave, is we do see margins continuing to accelerate, and there are a number of things driving that. One, obviously, is bringing together the Aon operating model under one operating model. And you can see the progress there in terms of the savings, $165 million of restructuring savings in 2017. We're on track to deliver the $300 million of savings in 2018 and, again, on track to deliver the $450 million of savings next year in 2019. So, that's obviously contributing to margin expansion. The second thing I'd say is we are continuing to improve on the core margins of our business through great work across the whole of Aon, which is just terrific. And the third I'd say, which is really the area Greg highlighted, which is we continue to invest in higher revenue growth, higher margin, higher return on capital areas, which is building leverage into the business. And I think Data & Analytics is the best example of that. It's a very high margin business, and that is translating through the higher free cash flow growth. So, we're very excited about the future growth in revenue, margins, and free cash flow.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. You have an open line.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. The near-term goal of at least $7.97 of adjusted EPS this year, I imagine when you said it, you didn't assume that there would be $0.16 of FX benefit this quarter. So, should we be thinking about that as you can hit $7.97 this year ex-FX?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So, Sarah at the time of the transaction in May 2017 we gave guidance of exceeding $7.97 EPS in 2018 as you said. We're not updating guidance on a quarterly basis based on tax headwinds, FX tailwinds or frankly much stronger operating performance. We do believe we're on track to exceed $7.97 and the results in Q1 demonstrate this.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you. And then just on the share buybacks. How should we think about the pace of that going forward, is a good proxy to think about adjusted income less dividends is being available for buybacks given that's, I think, your preferred way to deploy it, given the returns in the business?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes. I think that's absolutely right, Sarah. What I would say is if you look at free cash flow, we've got a use of cash on restructuring, we've got a use of cash on dividends and then that is essentially cash available for share repurchase, investment in organic opportunities and investment in M&A. And as you've seen, we continue to invest in share repurchase, because it remains the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon. And then the other thing I would note, Sarah, is as we grow operating income and free cash flow over the long term, you should expect that we'll grow debt to keep that debt to EBITDA in line with the ratio I outlined.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arash Soleimani of KBW. You have an open line.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Just quick question in terms of the tax rate, I know before you'd put a 19% expected rate for this year. Just curious if that changes, has changed at all based on increased clarity that you may have received in terms of the tax code?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Arash, we do believe that 19% is the correct rate for the full year 2018. And so, what you're really seeing is a lower tax rate in Q1 and then a higher tax rate in Q2, Q3 and Q4 to average to 19% for the year.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And I guess my next question is, are you seeing any changes in the demand for cyber especially with some of the European regulation?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Arash, as we've talked before we actually see tremendous client need sort of in this category. Virtually every client we talk to is addressing this question and it's a question of sort of at the board level, at the CEO level but also down on the operations of all of our clients' businesses. So this is an area of increasing concern for them. And as you've highlight, the $450 billion of reported loss last year there was against that kind of $3 billion in premium give or take. We are privileged to place a good portion of that. But if you think about $3 billion versus $450 billion, that's an area of substantial need and a great opportunity for us at Aon and as an industry to help our client support that. And that $450 billion, to your point, was largely U.S. based. When you think about the adoption of GDPR and the data requirements in Europe which literally kicked in this month, the reported requirements go up, which means the $450 billion is going to go into something that's closer to $1 trillion. So you're absolutely correct. This is an area of high, high need for our clients and an area of substantial opportunity for Aon which is one of the reasons we've invested so heavily behind it both in traditional ways, core brokerage and all of the things we do around that. The arrangements we've set up on behalf of clients but also with the investments we made in just content and insight, and Stroz Friedberg as an example, who have an extraordinary insight into sort of specific incidents and how they occurred, and why they occurred. And we're applying that to underwriting characteristics and criteria to create more opportunity for our clients. Q – [09QYVY-E Arash Soleimani]>: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. You have an open line.
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, Greg and Christa. Just wanted to circle back to organic growth for a second. So, if I understand your comments correctly, ultimately, we shouldn't read too much into a bit of a slowdown in the first quarter here. And for the full year, you still expect steady, if not accelerating, growth. Is that a fair summation?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Yeah. And I think you summarized it very well. There might be some noise, sort of back and forth on the different revenue lines. But, again, take a step back. Literally, we feel the trajectory continues very positively on the growth side for us, again, going back over multiple years now. Going back four years, 3% and 3% going then to 4% and 4%, we think we're on a very good progression for the year. And if you look at reported overall, as a firm, even though there was noise back and forth between the revenue lines, overall the firm were at 3% organic, 8% excluding FX reported, and 13% reported. So, these are very, very strong levels that continue to reinforce the growth trajectory of Aon. And, again, we look at this as kind of a single P&L. This is Aon overall delivering a growth top line, delivering operating improvement free cash flow growth, and that set of characteristics continues to look very positive.
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, maybe if I dig a little deeper into organic growth, you called out a couple things there, specifically weaker project-related revenue in both Retirement and Health and also very strong growth in EMEA in Commercial Risk Solutions. So, I was just hoping that maybe you could give a little more color around the project-related revenue. And then, on EMEA, can you maybe talk about how the UK is shaping up within EMEA? Is it also a contributor, or is it just so – are you seeing some weakening there that's offset by other growth in the region?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Well, let me make sure I get (37:29) which I think you're asking about, specifically, and then about EMEA and the UK. On the Health side, again, this represents a category with just tremendous monumental opportunity to assist clients that's currently strong and it's increasing. It's a category you've seen us invest in substantially, both organically and by M&A. Think about what we've done in the exchanges as well as M&A, things like Admix. We grew at 7% in 2017. And just to your point, we see 2018 as yet another year of similar growth in progress. So, all good things. There was a very strong comparable; 15% in 2017, and that was just some specific one-time initiatives to support clients, which were terrific, but as we think about the year very, very strong in terms of how that's progressing. And then, on EMEA, we just have an exceptionally strong team in EMEA and the UK. And they've done fantastically well; double-digit new business growth, which has been absolutely spectacular, sort of, across the region and in the U.K. We've also added capability. As I talked before about our two acquisitions, they've also come online and done exceptionally well. So, for us, this is just an area of opportunity and it continues to build, and we expect that progression to continue.
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And can you talk specifically about the project-related revenues, both in Retirement and Health?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Well, on the Health side, it was really more around – again, as we implement major programs for clients, occasionally, there are programs that – particularly, around some of the exchange work we do that are one-time, and the conversions, and we had a number of those in the first quarter 2017, which was terrific. But again, it drove a 15% organic number in Q1. Again, if you think about we ended up 7% for the year and that's what we see progressing over time. And on the Retirement side, it was really more around, as we described, it was really more timing than a specific project and the timing was around, again, different initiatives we take on behalf of clients and how were awarded on behalf of clients that are going to roll into the second half of the year – not the second quarter, but the second half of the year, that will fully balance out. And again, no change to overall projection and views on the year in that category.
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. You have an open line.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. My first question, just going back to the conversation on margins, you guys saw a 230 basis points of margin improvement this quarter on 3% organic. Do you view that as a sustainable level? And, I guess, what I'm also thinking about is, you guys told us there would be about – to get to the $300 million, we have about $135 million of saves for the full year. And you guys saw just under 40% of that level in the first quarter. So how do we think about the margin progression for the back three quarters in relation to just a different number of savings coming through, as well as, the 230 basis points of margin improvement you saw in the first quarter?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes. One of the things we would say, Elyse is, as we look at our revenue growth for the quarter, I know you're focused on organic, we really focus on total because M&A is absolutely contributing to top line and bottom line performance, and we're incredibly excited about the $1 billion of M&A we did in 2016 and the $1 billion that we did in 2017. And so, as we look at the 13% revenue growth for the quarter, that is absolutely contributing to margin expansion and we do expect margins to continue to expand in the second half of the year – well, in the balance of the year for full-year margin expansion. And if you think about the progress on margins for the full year, that will continue to occur as the savings ramp in the balance of the year.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And that was actually – to your point on the acquisitions, that was another question I had. So really two parts, as we think about modeling is – you guys saw about 5% revenue growth from acquisitions this quarter. Can you help us just think through the amount that could come through in the balance three quarters, kind of what rolls off and when or maybe just high level? And then, in terms of margins, were the acquisitions that came through in revenue this quarter, were they accretive to your margins, meaning are they running at stronger margins than the rest of your business?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes. So, Elyse, we haven't given revenue or margin guidance from the acquisitions. What I would say on reported revenue is, if you look at the last 10 years, reported revenue has been 6% CAGR. And so, that's a pretty good way to model revenue and, certainly, the way we think about it. Obviously, we're looking at the components of that, that are driven from organic versus M&A versus FX, but 6% reported is not a bad way to think about it because it's happened over a 10-year period of time. As we think about margins, they're typically lower on a full year basis in the first year because we've got a bunch of integration costs associated with them. And so that's definitely a way to think about acquisitions as they come in. They'll contribute to revenue. They will be a little lower margin in the first year, and then obviously, for us to do M&A, it has to have a return on capital higher than buyback. And so, it's certainly going to contribute in the long term.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then one last question, just going back to free cash flow quickly. Obviously, just some moving parts on each quarter, but the goal for the year, meaning 2018 is it still about double-digit off of the adjusted 2017, about that $1.8 billion number?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: That is exactly right, Elyse. So, what we would say is our long-term growth of free cash flow is double digits. If you take the $1.8 billion in 2017, we will grow double digits this year. And as you think about uses of free cash flow, 2018 is the peak year for restructuring the use of cash. And so as restructuring tails off in 2019 and every year off that, you'll see free cash flow accelerate.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Greg Case for the closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Thanks very much, everyone. I really appreciate you being part of the call and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you, all, for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc’s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today’s call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.
Gregory Case: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. For your reference I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Before we discuss the financial results of the quarter, I'd like to reflect on Aon overall in 2017 and the efforts of my colleagues to further strengthen our firm consistent with Aon's record of value creation. This year was a pivotal year for Aon. As we completed significant steps to reinforce and build upon a decade long strategy to be a leading global professional service firm delivering a broad range of risk, retirement and health solutions enabled by proprietary Data and Analytics. Earlier this year we completed the divesture of our outsourcing platform, a meaningful acceleration of our strategy and a tremendous accomplishment made possible by the tireless united efforts of our colleagues around the globe. The divesture provided a further catalyst for our strategy and actions to deliver shareholder value. And as it reinforced our focus to provide advise solutions and further align Aon's portfolio around our clients highest priorities. It generated significant capital to accelerate investment and emerging client needs and in our firm. Noting over 1 billion invested on high growth areas of M&A again in 2017. It's part of the catalyst to further unite our firm and our one operating model creating greater efficiency and operating leverage across the firm. And finally, the divesture reinforces our return on invested capital, decision making priority, and emphasis on delivering double-digit free cash flow growth over the long-term, highlighted by a record amount of capital returned to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Overall our optimism is got through conviction that the actions we're undertaking will substantially strengthen our firm on the heels of a decade of improvement in innovation for our clients and shareholders. With this momentum we are already seeing improvement in our growth profile driven by new investments, high growth, high margin areas across our portfolio. Organic revenue growth has increased from 3% in both 2014 and 2015 to 4% in 2016 and 2017 and noting that we end the year with four of our five major revenue lines delivering 5% or greater organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Again, I'd like to acknowledge my young colleagues who achieved these results while addressing many challenges, including working with our valued market partners to assist clients and navigating through one of the most challenging loss years in recent memory. Now turning to the quarter on page 5 of the presentation, consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First, is our performance against key metrics we commit to shareholders; second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investments. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year. We organically expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. In the fourth quarter organic revenue growth was 6% overall highlighted by strong growth in every major revenue line, including double-digit growth in Data and Analytic Services. Operating margin increased 200 basis points primarily reflecting core operational improvement and savings from investments in our Aon United operating model. EPS increased 18% to $2.35 reflecting both strong operating performance and effective capital management, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and a loss on the disposal of businesses. If we turn to the year, organic revenue growth was 4% overall including growth in every major revenue line, [indiscernible] by strong growth in areas of continued strategic investment. Operating increased 180 basis points. EPS increased 17% to $6.52. And finally free cash flow decreased $1.2 billion primarily reflecting tax payments related to the divestiture of our outsourcing business and investments in our operating model. Overall, a strong finish to the year with results of both the fourth quarter and full year reflecting strong organic revenue growth, core operational improvement and substantial progress in the first year of our Aon United operating model initiatives and effective capital management, highlighted by record return of capital for the full year. Turning to slide 7, on the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments. Organic revenue growth was 6% overall in the fourth quarter. Further, four of our five revenue lines delivered organic growth of 5% or greater with particular strength in data analytic services, reinsurance and health solutions, reflecting on each of our core growth platforms. In commercial risk solutions, organic revenue growth was 5%, an acceleration from flat in the prior year quarter. On average globally exposures were modestly positive and the impact from pricing was marginally negative resulting in a relatively stable market impact overall. Our results in the quarter primarily reflect strong growth in U.S. retail driven by double-digit new business generation and strong management of our renewable book portfolio. Internationally, we saw continued solid growth set by both Asia and Pacific regions. Results also entailed strong growth in our captive management business driven by multiple new client wins in the quarter, reflecting our leadership position in this space as we leverage our diverse risk consulting expertise to help clients relativesuccessful risk management program. In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 8%, an acceleration from 1% in the prior year quarter. I would note this is the highest level of organic revenue growth achieved in our reinsurance business in over a decade. Results reflect growth across every major category including three placements, faculty replacements and capital market transactions. Marketing path [ph] was neutral to results in the quarter reflecting both a continuation of moderating pricing as well as a modest upward pressure to loss exposed geographies. We saw particular strength in three placements driven by another quarter of record net new business generation. Results also reflect a modest nonrecurring benefit from many saving premiums as clients purchase more cover following the catastrophic events earlier in the year. Overall, this was a tremendous year of growth for our reinsurance business, reflecting our leadership and unmatched level of investment in data and analytics, our record level of cap on issuance and additional revenues from Cat driven reinstatement premiums. In Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was 4% acceleration from minus 2% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect growth across all major businesses and geographies. We saw particular strength in our talent rewards and performance practice primarily in [indiscernible] as well as assessment services. Results also reflect strong growth in investment consulting, including double-digit growth in delegated investment management solutions reflected an increase in client demand for Aon's tailored solutions and objective advices as well as an increase in performance fees for outperforming benchmark returns. Assets under management delegated investment management continued to trend upward increasing from $118 billion in the third quarter of 2017 to $134 billion in the fourth quarter driven primarily by client wins. With the recent close of the Townsend Group acquisition our total assets under management heading into 2018 are now approximately $150 billion up more than 60% compared with the prior year quarter. In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was 6% against a strong comparable of 30% in the prior year quarter. We saw strong growth globally in health and benefits brokerage reflecting continued strength in the U.S. and double-digit growth in Canada, Latin America, EMEA and Asia. In Healthcare Exchanges we saw a solid growth in our Active Exchange, while results in [indiscernible] exchange were impacted by certain project work that benefited the prior year quarter. In Data & Analytic Services, organic revenue growth was 12% an acceleration from 4% in the prior year quarter. Results primarily reflect continued growth in our Affinity business with particular strength in the U.S. growth in U.S. Affinity was highlighted by continued strong performance in Cat and travel solutions. Lastly, following significant catastrophic flooding events in the second half of the year we also saw an increase in certain nonrecurring revenue relating to claims processing activity on our flood business during the quarter. Turning to slide 8, to discuss areas of strategic investment. Clients continue to navigate in increasingly volatile world, but 2017 with 2017 being a costless year on record for weather related disasters, had an estimated $344 billion of economic losses. Weather related disasters, combined with economic, demographic, geopolitical forces and the exponential pace of technology change are all converging to create challenging new realities for our businesses and clients.  Aon has a strong track record of allocating capital to developing innovative first to market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value and response to specific client needs. Driven by strong operating performance, underlying free cash flow growth and transaction related proceeds, we deployed more than $1 billion of capital to attractive M&A in both 2016 and 2017. These strategic investments in high growth areas while improving the firm's long term growth profile and increasing operating leverage across the portfolio. We're investing organically and through M&A across our portfolio in areas such as Data & analytics and our important review businesses, in cyber risk advisory, in health and elective benefits brokerage through the acquisitions of Admix in Latin America and Universe and healthcare exchanges where we offer the broader set of solutions in health, geographically with the acquisitions of UMG and Henderson reinforcing our industry leading positive in the Netherlands and UK. And finally, in delegated investment management solutions, a business with rapidly growing client demand with the acquisition of the Townsend Group. The addition of Townsend significantly expands our investment capabilities by bringing greater depth of expertise in real estate and real estate assets to Aon's distribution scale and furthers our ability to provide more attractive alternative private market asset capabilities to clients. In summary, we finished the year with a strong performance in the fourth quarter reflecting 5% or greater organic growth across major revenue lines. Substantial operational improvement and significant progress in the first year of our Aon United operating model initiatives and effective capital management highlighted by the return of the record amount of capital to shareholders in 2017. Looking forward, we head into 2018 with continued momentum. The growth profile of the firm is improving, amplified by an unmatched level of investment as we continue to focus the portfolio around our highest value solutions and our clients' brightest needs. Combined with core operational improvement and savings of the Aon United operating model we believe we're on track to exceed $7.97 of earnings per share in 2018 and deliver double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term driving the next wave of substantial value creation for shareholders. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thank you very much Greg and good morning everyone. As Greg [indiscernible] our results reflect a strong performance in the fourth quarter and a solid year of progress in 2017. During such a pivotal year for the firm we delivered strong organic revenue growth, substantial operational improvement and underlying free cash flow growth while continuing to take significant strength steps to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our operating model. In addition we deployed $3.8 billion of capital in 2017 including the return of record $2.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchasing dividends and $1 billion dollars in acquisitions in high-growth, high-margin areas of our portfolio. Turning to slide 10 of the presentation, our core EPS from continuing operations excluding certain items increased 18% to $2.35 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $2 in the prior year quarter. And within the results was $0.06 per share favorable impact from foreign currency translation due primarily to a weaker U.S. dollar. In addition, we incurred $0.06 per share unfavorable impact recognized through other expense from the sales of certain businesses in the quarter and losses on the re-measurements of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have a similar favorable impact in the first quarter of 2018. With full year EPS included a $0.13 per share unfavorable impact recognized through other expense primarily for losses on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities and nonfunctional currencies partially offset by an $0.08 favorable impact on EPS from foreign currency translations. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 11 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization, non-cash restructuring charges, non-cash expenses related to pension settlements, certain tax related impact due to changes in the statuary legislation and $14 million reduction in charges related to certain UK regulations and compliance matters on further review as we believe that UK regulator risk is less than previously anticipated. The prior quarter also included transaction costs related to the sale of the outsourcing businesses. Turning to the next slide to discuss our strong operational performance, operating income increased $123 million or 18% with more than half of the dollar increase year-over-year driven by core operational improvements. Operating margin improved 200 basis points to 27.5% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement reflects $56 million or 190 basis points of savings from restructuring savings and other operational improvements before any reinvestments. This was partially offset by $3 million or minus 10 basis points of transaction costs related to recent acquisitions. FX translations have an immaterial impact to margin in the quarter. For the full-year operating income increased 15% and operating margin improved 180 basis points compared to the prior year. Operating margin includes up 20 basis points favorable impact from FX translations, offset by a minus 10 basis point impact to transaction costs related to acquisitions completed within the year and a minus 10 basis point unfavorable impact from lower non-cash income from pension and postretirement benefits. From a dollar standpoint operating income increased $306 million with $165 million driven by savings before reinvestment and $141 million driven by solid organic revenue growth and co-operational improvement, a strong performance operationally in the first year of execution against our multiyear investment firm. Before turning to the next slide, I want to spend a moment discussing the accounting changes that Aon will adopt beginning in the first quarter of 2018. There is a new accounting guidance related to the treatment of revenue from contracts with customers and new accounting guidance related to the presentation of costs associated with pension and other postretirement benefits. Ultimately these changes will have an immaterial impact on our full-year results. However, there will be a shift of certain revenues between courses most notably in our reinsurance business. In order to help you understand the impact of these changes and to easily update your model, the company has released unaudited pro forma financials for the last eight courses that present the retrospective impact of both of these standards on 2016 and 2017 results. These schedule can be found on page 15 to 21 of the press release as that of an Excel format on the investor relations area of our website. Moving on to page 12, I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the investments we're making to create the next generation global business model services model that allows for better scalability, flexibility and enhanced colleague and client experience. These investments are intended to create one operating model with increased operating leverage. Our primary investment areas are of course IT, real estate and people. In IT we expect to create greater insight from data center optimization, application management and strategic vendor consolidation. In real estate we expect to drive greater collaboration and engagement through real estate portfolio optimization. And in people we expect to create greater scalability of operations and activity including the use of centers of excellence and third-party providers. Our initial estimates were to invest $900 million of cash over a three-year period to deliver $400 million of annual estimated savings in 2019. After evaluating the current progress of the program and identifying further opportunities to improve our operating model, the program estimates have been updated to reflect an increase of $50 million in total expected savings for 2019. We now expect to invest an estimated $1.175 billion in total cash over three year period. These investments include an estimated $975 million of cash charges. We have incurred $497 million of expense and spent $280 million of cash to date. Future cash outlay is expected to increase modestly in 2018 then expected to decline each year thereafter. And an estimated $200 million of incremental CapEx investments with $27 million incurred in 2017 and approximately $100 million expected in 2018 and $70 million expected in 2019. There is an additional estimated $50 million of non-cash charges included as part of asset impairments. Overall we now expect these investments and other expense discipline initiatives to deliver $450 million of estimated annual savings in 2019 before any potential reinvestments. Further, we've been investing the balance of the transaction proceeds to the highest return on capital opportunities. As Greg mentioned, we returned a record $2.8 billion to shareholders in 2017 through share repurchases and dividends and we deployed over $1 billion of capital in acquisitions in high-growth, high-margin areas across the portfolio. Turning to the next page, in the fourth quarter we incurred $96 million of restructuring -related charges relating primarily to workforce reduction and other general initiatives. Year-to-date we've incurred $497 million of restructuring related charges representing 48% of the updated total program estimates. The cash impact in 2017 was an outflow of $280 million. We recognized $56 million of savings in the fourth quarter and $165 million of savings for the full year, representing 37% of the expected $450 million total program savings. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of operations on slide 14. Interest income increased $4 million to $7 million for Q4 compared to the prior year quarter reflecting additional income and on the balance of proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing business. As I noted last quarter higher cash balances in the short term have resulted in additional interest income, but balance of the coming down through the deployment of capital such that we would not expect the same level of interest income going forward. Interest expense increased $1 million to $71 million in Q4. Other expense of $19 million primarily includes a loss on the sale of certain businesses and losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates from the re-measurement of assets and liabilities and nonfunctional currencies. The prior year quarter reflects $9 million of income primarily including gains due to the favorable impact of exchange rates from the re-measurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies. Further, as I noted earlier, beginning in Q1 of 2018 we will adopt a new accounting standard that will shift the financial components of net periodic pension expense and net periodic postretirement benefit cost from above the line in compensation and benefit expense to below the line in other income expense. You can see the historical impact in our restated pro forma financials for 2016 and 2017 on pages 15 to 21 of the press release schedules or in appendix D of the presentation. Based on current assumptions we believe that approximately $10 million per quarter is the right run rate to model for other income expense in 2018. Excluding all other items we do not forecast, that could be favorable or unfavorable in any given period. Turning to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations excluding the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments increased to 15.5% compared to 12% in the prior year quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods reflects a net favorable impact in certain discrete items. The underlying operating rate was 17.9% based on geographic mix of income in the fourth quarter of 2017. I [indiscernible] that this quarter includes $345 million of additional tax expense on GAAP earnings that was adjusted from the non-GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter. This amount represents the provisional estimate of the impact of the U.S. tax reform based on Aon's initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and may be adjusted in future periods. Approximately $260 million of additional expense was incurred as a result of the transition tax related to repatriation of the cumulated foreign earnings and we would expect the cash associated with this expense to be paid out over the course of eight years. The balance of expense occurred in fourth quarter primarily relates to the write down of deferred tax assets to the reduction of the U.S. statutory tax rates. We expect that U.S. tax reform will have a modest upward pressure on effective tax rate. Based on initial interpretation of the changes in U.S. legislation, current assumptions of geographic mix of income, and impact of discrete items, we believe the best estimate of our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. This legislation is very new and it is possible that will be further guidance from the U.S. Treasury and others on interpretational application of the new rules. This can result in adjustments to our estimates. Lastly, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to $54.5 [ph] million in the fourth quarter compared to $268.3 million in the prior year quarter as we affectively allocate capital. The company repurchased $3.5 million class A ordinary shares for approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter and a record $2.4 billion of shares for the full year. The company has approximately $5.4 billion of remaining authorization under the share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on December 31st were $247.6 million and there are approximately $4.5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1, 18 beginning diluted share count is approximately $252 million subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to discuss our solid balance sheet and financial flexibility. At December 31, 2017 cash and short term investments decreased to $1.3 billion including the completion of both the Townsend and UMG acquisitions in the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was similar at $6 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis for continuing operations decrease modestly 3.2 times. As discussed previously, while debt to EBITDA will be initially elevated as a result of the sale of the outsourcing business, we expect to return back to the 2 to 2.5 times range by the end of 2018 driven by operational improvement. Cash flow from operations for the full year decrease $1.2 billion to $669 million primarily driven by $940 million of cash tax payments associated with the divesture of the outsourcing business, $280 million of cash restructuring charges and $45 million of transaction costs related to the divesture of the outsourcing business, partially offset by operational improvement. Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, decreased $1.2 billion to $486 million driven by a decline in cash flow from operations and $27 million increase in CapEx including investments to deliver Aon United operating model. Excluding the tax payments and transaction costs associated with the divesture as well as the investments in restructuring activities resulting from the divesture underlying free cash flow growth was 6% for the full year 2017. Given the strong organic revenue growth reported in the fourth quarter higher receivable balances increased working capital in the near term. Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the longer term, we value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Disciplined capital management approach is focused on a decision making process that maximizes return on invested capital which we've consistently improved each year since 2010 increasing 610 basis points to 17.8% in 2017. Either to feel so comfortable, We've also taken significant steps to maximize the translation of each dollar of revenue into the highest amount of free cash flow including working capital initiatives and actions to [indiscernible] cage our cash pension contributions. Since 2010 we've increased our free cash flow margin by nearly a thousand basis points. In 2017 free cash flow margin on underlying basis excluding the impacts of the divestiture was 17.8%. Looking forward, we expect two main drivers to contribute to free cash flow growth over the long term. The first is continued operational improvement driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the GAAP between receivables and payables we expect working capitals contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long term. In summary, we finished the year in a position of strength with momentum behind us as we head into 2018. We delivered strong operational improvements and double-digit earnings growth of 17% while continuing to make substantial steps to strengthen our firm over the longer term including investments in high growth areas and in our Aon United operating model. We believe that continued operational improvements combined with significant financial flexibility and underlying free cash flow generation positions the firm to deliver on our near term goal of exceeding 7.97 or exceeding 7.977 target. Yes, it's a great question youre ho ? ies adjusted earnings per share in 2018. More importantly, we believe this reinforces our ability to deliver double-digit annual growth in free cash flow over the long term reflecting what we believe is the next significant value creation opportunity for shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Styblo of Jefferies. You may now ask your question.
David Styblo: Hi there, good morning guys. How are you?
Gregory Case: Good Dave.
David Styblo: Good, so this is arguably the best organic growth quarter you've had in several years, not only from a total 6% standpoint, but also from a well balanced view where all the segments are contributing strong performance. And as always I can appreciate the margin profile and those puts and takes, but there are up 200 basis points in 4Q and that seems to be almost entirely driven by restructuring savings. And I know you guys have talked about reinvesting some of those savings at certain points. So I guess the question is, did you do that a material way this quarter and if not then why did margins expand more given the strong organic growth?
Gregory Case: So may be David a couple things, we'll hit the growth piece first and then sort of talk about the overall expansion as we think about improving the business overall which includes restructuring and core and Christa can talk about that a bit. First on the organic side, you're absolutely right, we feel very good not just about the quarter but really about across the year in terms of where we are and why we don't give specific guidance on expected levels of organic growth. If you look at our history and actual performance and put in perspective we think that's pretty interesting. If you go back and look at from '14 and '15 we're going roughly 3% across the board. Now in '16 and '17 that’s elevated to 4% and we're doing so in a way as Christa described, by investing in higher growth, higher margin areas in M&A and organically, as well as improving operating leverage of the firm. And that fundamentally is what's going to drive margin improvement overall and you're seeing that actually play out and it's played out in ’17, played out in ’16 and we would say as you go forward and think about organic growth, you're going to see that measured progression into ’18 and ’19. Now in terms of overall economic leverage and the operations we get out of it and Christa may be talk about the tradeoff between the two.
Christa Davies: Yes and Dave we’re absolutely true with the operational performance in 2017, 15% operating income growth we're very, very pleased with. As we think about that 8% operating income growth driven by restructuring savings and 7% growth driven by co-operational improvements. As we think about the growth in operating income and margin going forward it's really going to be a blend of core improvements in operations, restructuring savings and a return on the investments we've made in M&A we really invested over $2 billion in M&A in the last two years. And so we’re driving up operating leverage on a sustainable basis and you can see that through the accelerated revenue growth that Greg described, so improved top line which is really leading to a much stronger bottom line performance. And you can see that historically accelerating as well, so we’re very pleased with 2017 and we believe that we are very well positioned for a very strong 2018.
Gregory Case: That really does Dave put you on track if you think about the platform now, higher organic growth, higher margin, higher operating income growth across the board and we think ’17 proves that out and ’18 will show the same.
David Styblo: Okay, great and then, how do you guys think about the go no go decision for pay offs when you're generating incremental savings from restructuring plans versus making more restructuring investments. And kind if I take a step back and look at your additional $900 million investment looks like that was about a two-year, just over two year payback from the $400 million of savings and now you're spending about another $275 million. It looks like that's going to generate $50 million of incremental run rate savings. So that's more like a, seems like more like a five to fix year payoff. So can just help me understand, how you guys think through that process of whether to invest and when not to invest for the savings?
Christa Davies: Yes, David it's a great question, because we really do think about this as we think about all forms of cash usage on a return on capital basis, cash-on-cash return. And so whether we're spending money on share repurchase which is really our highest return on capital opportunity, we spent $2.4 billion on that this year or its M&A where we spent $1 billion dollars on that and we spent money on M&A you've really got to get at a higher return on capital than share repurchase which we have across that range of terrific opportunities we've invested in this year, or on the restructuring program where we're generating a great return for shareholders. And so it's a blend of all of these that gets us to return on capital as you can see for the firm at 17.8% in 2017. And so we're driving overall return on capital and as we think about that restructuring range of initiatives, we're very excited that we found incremental opportunities to generate more savings, overall a $450 million savings outcome in 2019 against $1.175 billion in cash that's a great return across that portfolio of activities.
Gregory Case: And again in essence if you think about sort of where we anticipate ending 2018 as you pull all this together the operating engine and the platform the Christa described and what we're doing with the operating model, we'll end ’18 again with an engine called Aon with a higher organic growth profile, higher margin, higher operating income growth, higher return on invested capital and that really is sort of the reason we undertook all the activities post the divesture of our outsourcing business to really reinvest and strengthen the firm. So the catalyst we talked about in June is really playing out we think quite effectively as we move into ’18 and we want you think about sort of what we look like at the end of ’18 when we get all this completed.
David Styblo: Okay, thanks and then just real quick on tax rates, I know you talked about 19% for this year. Previously you had talked about perhaps being able to have that drift over time, is there still an opportunity in ‘19 and beyond to see that tax rate possibly nudge down a little bit?
Christa Davies: What we would say is, our underlying effective rates were 17.5 for to 2017 and we do expect modest upward pressure based on U.S. tax reform. And what we would say is, based on what we estimate so far, our best estimate of full year non-GAAP for 2018 is 19% and we'll always look for opportunities whether that's tax rates coming down due to the tax rate, tax reductions across the world and we are very fortunate to be domiciled in the U.K. with a territorial system and a global capital structure where we manage all that capital and cash on a global basis.
Gregory Case: And one of the things, if you look at the punch line for tax rate overall and our history and sort of our capability in that arena, I think the punch line for us is really this is a marginal event overall as you think about all that's written about it. It doesn't change our views on what we're going to achieve for 2018 as Christa described at 7.97 plus doesn't change what we're doing from an operational improvement standpoint all the things we're doing that really is a marginal event overall in terms of what we're trying to accomplish and free cash flow generation of the firm nothing has changed in the context of any of this as we push forward.
David Styblo: Right, got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Sarah DeWitt: Hi, good morning. On the increase in the expense savings target, could you just talk about what areas drove that? And then secondly, at $450 million that's still only above 6% of cost, so to what extent do you think there could potentially going to be some more for further upside?
Christa Davies: Yes, Sarah as we think about it we're creating the next generation global business services model. I'm really driven by running Aon as one firm, Aon United and it's going to drive better scalability, flexibility and really operating leverage for the firm we're building in productivity savings as we scale the business going forward. And really as we looked across this operating model across the firm, it's really the same three areas that we're driving the increased savings in. It's IT, it's real estate and it's people and as we bring Aon together really out of the two segments we used to operate in, in 2016 into one Aon operating model under Aon United, we're really identify further savings. $450 million is our current estimate of savings and that will be delivered in 2019 and we don’t see further upside at this time Sarah, but we'll continue to optimize the model and we’re very excited about the progress so far.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, great thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber of William Blair. You may now ask your question.
Adam Klauber: Thanks. Amazon had a big announcement obviously in the health industry. One are any of those companies your clients and two how do you think that will just some broad strokes how will that impact the industry over the like next five years or so?
Gregory Case: So Adam from our standpoint we don't talk about clients specifically, although I would say we're in a very privileged position in terms of who we serve across the world. And in terms of sort of what was announced, there's not a lot of clarity on it, but we love the spirit of it. We just absolutely love the spirit of it, you how much we love this category, it's just such a monumental opportunity and it's driven out of a set of needs both for companies and in their employees which is so high. I mean you know the statistics overall health is challenge. Per unit cost health care is going up. You know the $150 million Americans that we address and this is really a U.S. story principally, although for us it's a global opportunity. But for $150 million Americans and employer sponsored plans there's just substantial pressure everywhere. And our whole, monitor our whole approach has been, you know when you can create greater alignment between employers and employees, greater transparency give them choice, they are least better decisions, healthier employees and lower costs and we are absolutely excited in favor of anything that moves in that direction because this opportunity is so massive. And you know, we've invested very, very heavily and innovated around active employees as well as retirees and in a word we believe in a very, very unique position to shape this outcome and see in a movement my company has taken initiative in this arena is just absolutely terrific, so looking forward to see how this evolves.
Adam Klauber: Great and then Data and Analytics had clearly a strong quarter. Could you give just one or two examples of the type of wins that drove that could be a positive number.
Gregory Case: Well, actually Adam it really comes across the board. So the daytime expense is particularly on the Affinity side as that's an exceptional wins with clients. And again this is where we're taking segments of clients understanding sort of overall needs, aggregating those needs and coming up with very innovative solutions to address those needs and we've seen a great example of that across the board on the on the Affinity side. We also have the business in point is in this category as well. We're actually helping insurers and broader companies think about more holistically how they think about their risk management needs. This is outside the placement in a consulting and advisory basis done exceptionally well in that. And as we added before we also benefited a bit given the activity in the second half of the year on the flood side. So really this is for us, we love this category, this is obviously a category we're breaking out Data & Analytic services. We want to put a spotlight on it. It will be variable sometimes up a lot sometimes up a little bit. Over time, we think up a lot and it's an area of substantial investment we're going to make over time and we think it's going to be beneficial for Aon, for our clients, and for our shareholders.
Adam Klauber: Okay and then thanks. This is finally for Christa, operating cash at roughly $2.3 billion, $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion in ’16 you are investing the business in ’17, you're investing in ’18, so by ’19 do you think we get back to those levels or could we possibly exceed those levels by ’19?
Christa Davies: Yes, look we certainly think that's true Adam and what we would say is our goal is really double digit free cash flow growth over the long term and we’re obviously driving improved return on capital on a cash on cash basis driven by strong operational improvement, restructuring savings, and the return on the investments we're making in M&A. And so we feel all three of those are going to contribute strong free cash flow growth combined with working capital improvements which are going to be substantial over $500 million over the long term.
Adam Klauber: Okay great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my call. So my first question is with regards to the reiteration of the $7.97 EPS target for 2018, the adjusted EPS and I guess if I look at the net impact of tax reform and the $50 million of additional cost savings not all of which I'd expect to flow through in ’18. I think I get a negative impact between the two. So I'm just trying to better understand what else is driving either to feel so comfortable in that 7.97 or exceeding 7.97 target?
Christa Davies: Yes it's a great question Yaron, and what we would say is, we delivered 7% EPS growth in 2017, including a headwind from both a higher effective tax rate and significant one-time impact tin other expense year-over-year. Our underlying effective rate was 17.5 for2017 so you've got a modest upward pressure based on the changes in your tax reform, but despite the high tax rate of 19% we believe strong operational performance, savings and Aon United model, returns on the investments we've been making in high growth, high margin M&A areas, we'll continue to reinforce our confidence in exceeding 7.97 on 2018 and delivering double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term.
Yaron Kinar: Okay, just so it sounds like it's may be more of a margin improvement story given the investments you've undertaken?
Christa Davies: Absolutely, I mean it's operating income gross and it's operating income growth and it's operating income growth coming from the core, coming from restructuring and coming from the M&A investments we've made in high growth high margin areas.
Gregory Case: Understand as well, what we're doing on the one Aon approach on the operating side that Christa described, that's creating operating leverage in our business. This is just about a dollar tax save this creates greater operating leverage so as we grow organically we get disproportionate benefit from that and then if you think about sort of the investments and acquisitions and higher growth, higher margin areas all these things come together to give us the confidence that Christa described.
Yaron Kinar: Okay and then with regards to free cash flow generation so and you have a long term target of double digit growth. If I think let's say the next year, you think it's reasonable to expect that level of growth in 2018 on an underlying basis.
Christa Davies: Yes, I mean what we would say Yaron is we're looking at double digit free cash flow growth over the long term so that’s every year over the next couple of years and what we would say is it's driven by ’18 is absolutely going to improve and you still 6% underlying free cash flow growth in 2017 and really it was actually looking much higher that and really driven by very strong organic growth in Q4 we had slightly higher working capital and, so you can say that you're generating then even in 2017 with everything going on. We think 2018 will improve and 19, 20 and 21 will continue to accelerate form that.
Yaron Kinar: Okay, got it and one final question. Just you have very strong growth in the reinsurance brokerage business. Can you maybe walk us through your thoughts as to the ILS market in 2018. I think we've seen a lot of replacement of capital of the last quarter and a bit. How do you see that market develop over the course of this year.
Gregory Case: Yaron with first of all, we had a remarkable year and reinsurance for colleges just have done a terrific job sort in that category as we are number one in 3D, we're number one in fact, we're number one in ILS and make another additional investment sort of outside that, that sort of arenas sort of really was a remarkable year and we actually had progress on the organic side in all categories wasn't just one category. And we also continue to make substantial sort of investments across the board to sort of strengthen or do nowadays in the context of that. So against that backdrop, when you think about sort of the ILS market number one of that marketplace that performed exceptionally well, if you look at now was about $600 billion in global reinsurance capital overall and alternative capitals to increase to about $82 billion give or take, so it's kind of 14%, 15% of the overall global reinsurance capital pool. It was all terrific performance there and again our colleagues were just absolutely remarkable and both the level and quality of work they did throughout ’17 and actually into ’18 as we watch capital come back and [indiscernible] market come back in and replenish losses, so you're right it was a remarkable year for us on the reinsurance side across the board included in the ILS world. Q - Yaron Kinar And do you have any thoughts with regard to how that continues to develop an ’18.
Gregory Case: Well, listen if you think about growth overall for us in ’18 and you mention growth at the beginning and I would sort of say, sort of in that context we're going to continue to make progress as I mentioned we had some small benefit. In terms of sort of the reinstatements that happened sort of at the end of the year, so there's a bit there but we really saw growth in all the different areas I describe before. You'll see a continuation of growth across Aon I don't think we always think about it from an Aon standpoint 3% in ‘14 and ‘15, 4% in ‘16 and ‘17 and you'll see that trend continue as we move into ’18.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. I appreciate all the color.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. Good Morning. Sort of a small ball question when you've got reinstatement premiums driving to a limited extent reinsurance organic growth are there any expenses offsetting those incremental revenues.
Gregory Case: There are some and again I would think about this moralistically, we've got the level of service required in the complexity of what went on sort of at the end of the year is just absolutely astronomical, so the things that cause those sort of that in ecosystem of sort of comes together in sort of the service of the client. The payment of claims, the movement of service overall so for us this is, this kind of all blends together, so there is a little bit of potentially some upward pressure our upward benefit on the margin side but I wouldn't overplay that. Nor would I reply to the impact of the reinstatement they were there, they were real but when you think about performance overall it was really driven by fundamentals on the reinsurance side.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess this is for Christa, can you walk us through I guess directionally our changes in interest rate affect or interact with the new pension accounting.
Christa Davies: I'm not sure, Meyer I just [indiscernible] little bit more about your question because obviously interest rates if interest rates were to rise. They have a positive benefit to out pension unfunded liability and pension contributions by the time 100 basis point increase in the discount rate which is really equivalent to AA corporate bond rate reduces our pension unfunded liability by about $400 million and so I mean I don't know if that's helpful or what you were looking for.
Meyer Shields: It is, I just want to put that in the context of the new standards above the line versus below the line items.
Christa Davies: Sorry, there is no impact on the above the line, below the line. It's just a movement in the location of the P&L. Used to be in comp and benefits affects it's now in other income and expense there's no change the absolute dollar in the P&L. I mean we’ve given guidance that what you should expect in other income and expense on that pension specific item is about $10 million in expense a quarter.
Meyer Shields: Right, so just close the loop if interest rates continue to rise, then obviously or I’m asking not obviously that would benefit the expenses going forward.
Christa Davies: Yes, it would. 
Christa Davies: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of  Thank you very much. Thank you next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. You may now ask your question.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi good morning. My first question you guys are pretty strong. Pick up and growth in commercial risk. I think there were some timing move in the third quarter, if you could just give us kind of a little bit of an outlook in that business and would you expect you guys pointed to a stable market impact overall in the fourth quarter, would you expect exposures and prices to move when we think about the market impact for 2018.
Gregory Case: So at least a couple perspectives first on commercial risk and again remember we're breaking out commercial risk differently than anyone else so we used have all these together now we’re breaking out this specifically. We'd encourage you to look at that over the course of the year and you see ’17 has continued progress over ’16 our collogues continue to do a terrific job net new business generation was at record levels, so really terrific on the commercial reside. And from a pricing standpoint your question we have to look at all and as we look at our overall book and we calculated down to the individual risk, exposures are modestly positive as we described pricing was marginally negative, still marginally negative leading to a relatively stable market in impact overall. I would have there as we said before insured values are what's most important, they drive more the economic impact and than anything else. And as we absorb the global economic environments, we believe it looks slightly better in ’18 then it is ’17 which has positive implications but I would emphasize as we continue to do our work and make our investments in data analytics it means we're evaluating risk at a very detailed micro client level which we believe enables much better outcomes in pricing. In terms of issues for our clients and ends up being much less about the state of the market and more about individual client dynamics sort of the drive, sort of what happens for us overall. And there's already a [indiscernible] for us in our client - and sort of what we've done there. The investments in these kinds of capabilities, we think create great outcomes for clients again analyze at the individual level and in our client for as example we got 800 clients, so there are now 300 placements. The clients were up 25% and so in this [indiscernible] we totally their choice. They're seeing an up and outcome an opportunity which is much better for them and so it's less about the overall market and where they are specifically we even had a client in energy client, Caribbean energy client. That frankly it undergone some trauma was worried about literally whether you were going to come out in overall process to Aon client 3D and other analytics and end up actually at roughly stable pricing with very strong terms conditions and absolutely thrilled sort of the overall outcome, so I want to put in perspective on how we think about sort of the overall market environment much more clients and market.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you and then in terms of the tax paid out well on the 19% going forward does that Christa this I know in the first quarter of last year there was obviously a benefit from stock comp, so we think about the 19% is that excluding if we can see any kind of benefit from the stock comp accounting in the first quarter and kind of X any other discrete items.
Christa Davies: At this stage Elyse it is all encompassing on that we would say it based on our initial interruption and changes in U.S. legislation, kind of functions of geographic mix and impact of discreet and therefore that’s our full year non-GAAP effective rate at ’19 and then based on what we see during the year this great could be up or down.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great and then another question in terms of you guys have raised on the savings program by $50 million this quarter but the cash charges to go up by $275 million. I'm just trying to understand if we think about those two numbers together why would it have, why is it taking $275 million of additional charges to yield $50 million of additional saves. And basically reducing the yield, the yield on the charges of the entire program, what kind of really drove the higher cost with the $50 million this quarter.
Christa Davies: So Elyse we don't really think about it that way we think about it as an overall portfolio of the program and therefore we think about $1.175 billion in cash driving $450 million in savings which is a terrific return on investment as I said earlier on restructuring. We do really think about restructuring, share repurchase, M&A any kind of cash investment on a return on invested capital basis, cash-on-cash return. And so we're looking at this cash-on-cash returning and saying that as an exception return. And we identified for the savings and we thought that it made sense to deliver those savings and so that's really how we're managing this on an overall portfolio basis as suppose the incremental way in which you described it.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great and then one last question on the share repurchased obviously it's been [indiscernible] bit this year just given some of the acquisitions and when they closed, how should we think about the level of share repurchase going forward for 2018.
Christa Davies: So first of all we don't give guidance on share purchase what we can say is we've got a strong balance sheet, cash [indiscernible] from investments $1.3 billion at year end 2017 were generating strong free cash flow growth through the operating income growth and working capital improvements as we said and we look at allocating capital based on the highest return on capital on share purchase remains the highest return on capital activity across Aon which is why you saw as to $2.4 billion share repurchase in 2017 and we expect to continue share repurchase in 2018.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Kai Pan: Thank you and good morning. So I just follow up this question on the share buybacks. I just working through my math about the 2018 free cash flow is that like if you adding back the $940 million of onetime like a tax payments in 2017 we've got $1.4 billion is that run rate like a baseline run rate, is the correct way to look at it.
Christa Davies: I mean they're obviously some onetime cash outlays Kai in 2017 the two biggest ones with a $940 million of cash taxes as you said and the restructuring charges and so look what I would say is you so underlying free cash flow growth of 6% in 2017. There was one time items that you should back out to get your run rate and then we do expect strong free cash flow growth in 2018, driven by strong operational performance in the call, restructuring savings, return on the investments we've made from M&A and improvement from working capital.
Kai Pan: Okay, so if you could do the math 1.4 starting points you're going to spend same amount or leave it even more little bit more on the restructuring cost then you grow double digit on that and then you take $400 million, dividends you have more than a little bit more than a $1 billion dollars spend between acquisition and buybacks which will be significantly less than what have to seen in 2017.
Christa Davies: Kai, I’m not going to give guidance from free cash flow for 2018. We don't give out that number what I can say is we do expect strong free cash flow growth in 2018. We do have an elevated cash and short term investments on the balance sheet $1.3 billion on left over from that cash in the transaction obviously we expect to generate substantial free cash flow in addition to the cash and short term investments have in the balance sheet to drive overall deployable cash in 2018. We believe the highest return on capital activity to use that cash is share repurchase and we expect obviously to look at M&A. We've got a terrific M&A pipeline and to continue organic investment. As we have in 2017 in high growth areas of the business.
Kai Pan: Okay, that's great. My follow up is on is different topic on the FCA investigation if I heard it correctly you mentioned that there are some reduction in term of regulatory related costs in the quarter could you explain a bit the what's behind that and also did you have any updates on the FCA investigations.
Gregory Case: One of my start just overall and Christa can talk specifically about sort of what we did in the quarter because indication sort of how we feel about the process overall at this point. First we welcome the opportunity to assess wise to make our industry more effective and responsive to clients fundamentally that's what this is all about. I’d reserve three things sort of in the context of this. One is around the client imperative what this all means, the second is kind of the size of our work in this area. Aon’s work in this area because it seems the numbers don't quite make sense to us and then overall profitability and the impact that this might have been in London that's been written about two which also don't seem to square with totally the fact but the most important piece of this is the clients in all aspects what we do has to focus on client value and clients [indiscernible] it really is a reason our industry exists and why Aon exists. And we invest in huge amount in the city to innovate for our clients and even the restaurants got to drive value for our clients be fully transparent to them in our approach and also the optional. And every respect, they've got to be able to decide where they want to begin to approach out of the approach and as I described before Aon client 3d is a great example. We spent years develop the analytics behind it and we're able now to look at our book of business risk by risk than aggregate it's a portfolio level. This creates enormous benefit for our clients and by the way 1800 of opted into this their choice it's grown by 25% in ’17 coming up on 4000 placements I think 3800 placements and gave the examples of the Caribbean energy company. I kid you not this company was in a situation where it was really struggling in terms of what the risk programs and look like going forward and to be able to take advantage Aon client 3D 20% guarantee capacity literally fully set on followed price, followed form, followed claims. From really care was incredibly helpful even more some may be in the lifesaver in terms of how they thought about it, so very, very positive and would highlight, what we do there is it's a lot of service, lot of activity under are urge has to do, so we do the underwriting a policy issuance, the administration etcetera. So the care doesn’t bear that cost we do, I'm really trying to highlight is one point around the client imperative of this. And the second is just the size of our work in this area I've just highlight for the perspective on this call I put everything into this category called facilities although we would argue Aon client 3D is long way from a classic facility. And the amount we place in on the market amounts to less than $40 million in revenue just for reference which is sort of lot of suspect written but that's the facts and then finally the one I find most interesting is sort of that the overall profitability is impacting the London market operating costs, just for reference it's just not actually correct if you look at sort of store everything and our overall benefit what we get paid is we place premium in a London market that yields so we moved over denominator very straightforward everything and including the cost and client 3D everything. It’s basically then flat for last five or six years, so there's no kind of super normal return here when you put everything together and anything we get extra sort of on the client 3D piece again we're investing heavily to actually do services that underwriters used to do, so for us the most important piece of this all things as I were started was we just see such great value for clients and getting our risk place and getting our claims paid. This is an area of substantial investment for us. And we absolutely welcome the opportunity to assess how we can make our industry more competitive on these fronts. Now against that backdrop the punch line of that is you ask us, how do we assess our risk is it going up or down you know Christa may be you can talk about both the action we took in the quarter.
Christa Davies: Yes and so what you saw in the quarter Kai was that we took a reduction a $14 million in charges related to certain U.K regulatory and compliance matters. As we believe our U.K. regulatory risk is less than we previously anticipated.
Kai Pan: I really appreciate all the color.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. You may now ask your question.
Paul Newsome: Just want to see if you could give us a little bit of color about the margin impact on the acquisitions that you've made whether or not we should see the compression or expansion related to the acquisitions themselves and if those impacts are change over time when you peers talked about sort of margin compression.
Christa Davies: And Paul that is exactly right. I think what we observed in the first year of an acquisition is margin compression and you saw in the quarterly close you know two fantastic acquisitions the Townsend Group and UMG and we certainly saw margin compression in Q4 due to acquiring those businesses and so what you usually see is margin compression in the first year and then they contribute to margin expansion and operating income growth in the years thereafter. And really the reason for that margin compression in the first year is just the transaction cost to close the acquisition.
Paul Newsome: So if that's acquisition cost it presumably you're essentially putting businesses on at the same that have the underlying same margin as opposed to trying to buy something that you’re hearing expand the margins.
Christa Davies: Yes, so we are obviously investing in higher growth, higher margin opportunity areas and we certainly see that, that was the case in 2016 and 2017 and then as you bring them into Aon we can really scale those businesses on to expand margins over time.
Gregory Case: One of the realities Paul for us is that you think about the foundation of the return on invested capital approach that Christa described and we take in every investment of capital we make we don't invest this to get bigger I mean our is has to be we are bringing in content that we can scale and in doing so we create we think superior economic value. Christa describe in the transition costs of doing that and what you've got the fees etcetera up front but there's no business we bring in sort of say we're just going to continue to have a performance performed. We're taking their business and scaling across Aon are finding ways to improve that business based on Aon assets and I fundamentally drives the transactional capital approach we take otherwise you don't make acquisitions because buyback looks better.
Paul Newsome: Fantastic congrats in the quarter.
Gregory Case: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. You may now ask your question.
Brian Meredith: Hey thanks. Couple of quick questions for you, first Christa, just I believe you give what your kind of free cash flow based on that for 2017 is in the presentation that's like $1.8 billion is that correct, the Appendix G gives us 1778.
Christa Davies: Yes, that's right.
Brian Meredith: Okay, so that's what we can used as a baseline here kind of looking forward okay.
Christa Davies: Yes.
Brian Meredith: Second question is, I'm just curious when you think about the expense saves and stuff kind of going forward and kind of benefits, what are you thinking about and I guess as far as wage inflation because we're definitely seeing some upward pressure on that going forward?
Christa Davies: Yes, Brian one of the things we would say is, we normally expect wage inflation let's call it, 2% on your biggest expense base call people. What we would say though is, we're obviously investing a significant amount of money, $1.175 billion in the Aon United operating model and the reason why I'm investing that kind of moneys drive $450 million of savings is because we are trying to get better operating leverage throughout our business. And improved productivity going forward and so we expect the investments we're making in the operating model to offset some post and that wage inflation to give us greater operating leverage in our business going forward.
Brian Meredith: Hey great, and then last question Greg or Chris could you talk a little bit about stars Freberg, how is that kind of perform for you since you brought it in and also I know you were looking to come to develop then bunch of insurance products around cyber which stars Freberg can you talk about progress there, how is the market accepting et cetera?
Gregory Case: Yes, Brain for us we love this investment and it really just speaks to what innovation means and how one pursues it. Again if they're back and think about their well cyber marketplace just for reference pick your number $2.5, $3 billion of premium in 2017 give or take, by the way going up substantially, so the industry is celebrating. We've got a category, it’s new, its going up, it's terrific by the way Aon places as much or more than anybody in the marketplace you've got an incredible group of colleagues have driven this and led this having said that our colleagues would be the first to say look when you think about client need. Client need and our ability to meet their increasing needs on Cyber pick take your numbers its $450 billion of loss connected to related to cyber in ’17 so think about Brian $2.5 billion to $3 billion in premium, $450 billion and reported loss connected thereof. And by the way just for reference that includes zero for Europe and by the way just for reference that includes roughly zero for Europe because they didn't require you to report cyber losses that will obviously change in May, June of this year when GDBR kicks in and the regulations require cyber laws sireqiinI [indiscernible] and the regulations require cyber loss reporting which means cyber loss on a global scale is going to a trillion dollars. And yet worse our industry and by the way we're the leader, our industry is $2.5 billion to $3 billion. We are not meeting the needs of our clients, so we said listen what's the root cause of that how do we understand that and that's why we brought in [indiscernible]. This was not a set of is not a set of colleagues who knew insurance but they knew cyber better than anyone in the world. They do cyber remediation, identification, they work for boards extensively. They've got a database of 45,000 cyber events and growing every day. So if we could actually help capital underwriters understand where and how to address the cyber we would end up with a much better set of products on behalf of our clients and we're seeing great uptake in terms of sort of that it's going to take time no doubt this is not an easy thing to do but watch the press and you'll see some announcements all over the coming bit of time that we think will be interesting in terms of sort of innovations but it will be proper you know be steps at a time around all the progress. One thing is for sure if we as an industry don't innovate on behalf of our clients in the topic of cyber they will leave us behind and so we have got to be on front of it in [indiscernible] Freberg is a great example as how you get out in front of it as well as bring in another capability that we have around the firm, so we're excited about it. It will take time, will take energy but credit to my Aon colleagues who've really sort of embraced that challenge enter and are working to through and we're excited about it for clients.
Brian Meredith: Great, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory Case: I just want to say thanks everybody for taking part today. We look forward to discussion next quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-10-27 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Greg Case - President and CEO Christa Davies - CFO
Analysts: Sarah DeWitt - J.P. Morgan Dave Styblo - Jefferies Adam Klauber - William Blair Mike Phillips - Morgan Stanley Paul Newsome - Sandler O’Neill Arash Soleimani - KBW Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc’s Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today’s call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2017 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case: Thanks very much and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Before beginning the discussion on our Q3 and year-to-date results, I would like to pause for a moment to reflect on the recent catastrophic events that have impacted various communities and millions of individuals around the world. Our sincere condolences go out to families who are enduring this trauma, to business owners forced to rebuild, and to those remain at risk or without sufficient resources. We are very fortunate that our 3,000 colleagues and their families across 30 Aon offices directly affected by the series of events were safe. During times of tragedy and devastation, it is heartening to see my colleagues from across the firm rise up and unite to help their neighbors, fellow collogues and clients. Aon is also a partner of Red Cross investing in their disaster relief efforts to respond in times of need and offering volunteer work on the ground to aid the millions of individuals personally affected. I can’t begin to express enough gratitude to my Aon collogues and partners who put forth tremendous effort during the time of such human need. With all hands on deck, we are fully focused on supporting our clients and our colleagues through the continued aftermath of these events. Now, referencing back to the specific topic of this call, we’d like to highlight that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. As we discussed on prior calls, Aon’s current position is a result of a proven decade-long strategy that focuses on aligning our portfolio solutions around our clients’ highest priorities in the arenas of risk, retirement and health. We’ve taken significant steps to get here. Earlier this year, we completed the divestiture of our outsourcing platform, which provides a further catalyst for our strategy and actions to deliver substantial shareholder value. With approximately $3 billion of additional capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs and in our Aon United operating model, we expect to substantially strengthen our firm even further. We’re already seeing improvement in our growth profile driven by investments in high-growth, high-margin areas across our portfolio. For example, our organic growth has accelerated year-to-date from 2% in 2015 to 3% in both 2016 and now 2017. And we’re taking further steps to unit Aon with investments to progress toward a single global business services operating model, increasing Aon’s efficiency and connectivity, and through one global P&L encompassing all of Aon’s industry-leading capabilities, helping us deliver all of global Aon to their clients in their local markets. Now turning to the quarter on page five of the presentation. Consistent with previous quarters, I would like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second, overall growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 2%, highlighted by strong growth in Reinsurance and Retirement Solutions. Operating margin increased by 170 basis points, primarily reflecting savings from investments in our Aon United operating model and core operational improvement. EPS increased 18% to $1.29, reflecting both strong operating performance and effective capital management. Finally, free cash flow decreased $881 million year-to-date, primarily reflecting tax payments related to the divestiture. Overall, Q3 was a quarter of continued progress with year-to-date results reflecting 3% organic revenue growth, 170 basis points of margin improvement and 17% EPS growth heading into our seasonally strongest quarter of the year. Turning to slide seven, on the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments. Organic revenue growth was 2% overall in the third quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, on a year-to-date basis, organic revenue growth was 3%, reflecting growth across all five revenue lines with particular strength in Health and Reinsurance Solutions. Reflecting now on each of our core growth platforms. In Commercial Risk Solutions, organic revenue declined 1% against the strong comparable of 4% growth in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included a benefit from certain onetime items. On average, globally, exposures are modestly positive and the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulting in a relatively stable market impact overall. Our results in the quarter reflect modest growth internationally across EMEA, Asia and the Pacific, driven by strong new business generation and management of our renewable portfolio. In the U.S., results faced headwind from the timing of certain items. Given recent catastrophic events and significant industry challenges, our global teams prioritize helping clients with immediate action plans, claims processing and recovery efforts in the quarter. Overall, we believe our results in Commercial Risk Solutions for the third quarter reflect the confluence of unfavorable timing and events in our seasonally smallest quarter, against the strong comparable in the prior year. We believe the underlying results are better viewed on a year-to-date basis and we would expect the fourth quarter to show growth in our seasonally strongest quarter. In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 7%, an acceleration from flat in the prior-year quarter. I would note, this is the second consecutive quarter of the highest level of organic revenue growth achieved in our reinsurance business in five years. Results reflect growth across every major area including treaty placements, capital markets transactions and facultative placements. We saw a particular strength in treaty placements, driven by record new business generation including several new clients to Aon and a modest benefit from reinstatement premiums following the recent events. Results were partially offset by modest, unfavorable market impact, primarily in the Americas. In Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5%, an acceleration from 4% in the prior year quarter. We saw a continued strong growth in investment consulting, including double-digit growth in delegated investment management solutions, reflecting an increase in client demand for Aon’s tailored solutions, independent [ph] advice, as well as increase in performance fees for outperforming benchmark returns. Assets under management and delegated investment management continue to trend upward, reaching a $118 billion in the third quarter. We also saw a solid growth in our talent practice, primarily from compensation survey and benchmarking services. In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2%. We saw strong growth in health and benefits brokerage including double-digit new business generation with particular strength in the U.S. and Latin America. Results were partially offset by a decline in project-related work in the healthcare exchange business. On a year-to-date basis, organic revenue growth was 7%, an acceleration from 4% in the prior year. In Data & Analytic Services, organic revenue growth was 3%. Results primarily reflect growth in our Affinity business, with particular strength in the U.S. Growth in U.S. Affinity was highlighted by continued strong performance in pet and financial solutions as well as the modest increase in claims processing in our employed business following the recent activity. Now, turning to slide eight to discuss areas of strategic investment. Clients are navigating an increasingly volatile world where economic, demographic and geopolitical forces combined with the exponential pace of technology change are all converging to create a challenging new reality for businesses. Aon has a strong track record of allocating capital for developing innovative, first-to-market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs. We’re investing organically and through M&A across our portfolio in areas such as Data & Analytics, in our InPoint and Re/View businesses; cyber risk advisory through the recent acquisition of Stroz Friedberg; Affinity, in multiple areas across the business; health and elective benefits brokerage through the recent acquisitions of Admix in Latin America and Univers; healthcare exchanges, where we offer the broadest set of solutions in health; geographically with the pending acquisition of UMG, reinforcing our industry-leading position in the Netherlands; and finally, in delegated investment management solutions, a business with rapidly growing client demand. In the third quarter, we announced the pending acquisition of the Townsend Group, a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services, primarily focused on real estate. Townsend significantly expands our investment capabilities by bringing greater depth of expertise in real estate and real estate assets to Aon’s distribution scale and furthers our ability to provide more attractive, alternative, pilot market asset capabilities to our clients. Overall, our strategic investments in high growth areas and in Data & Analytics are improving the firm’s long-term growth profile, driven by new business generation, strong retention rates, and increased operating leverage across the portfolio. In summary, during the quarter, where client and colleague needs were our immediate priority, we delivered strong operational improvement and double-digit earnings growth, reflecting increased operating leverage and performance on new initiatives, in addition to the year-to-date return of approximately $2.1 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Looking forward, we expect a strong finish to the year with continued momentum amplified by an unmatched level of investment driving the next wave of innovation for clients and substantial value creation for our shareholders. I’m now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our performance marks a solid quarter of progress highlighted by strong operational improvement and effective capital management while continuing to take significant steps to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our operating model. Our results year-to-date reflect growth across every major revenue line, strong operational improvement, and double-digit earnings growth heading into our seasonally strongest quarter of the year. Turning to slide 10 of the presentation. Our core EPS from continuing operations, excluding certain items, increased 18% to $1.29 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.09 in the prior-year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 11 and 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges, charges related to certain regulatory and compliance matters, non-cash expenses related to pension settlements in the prior-year quarter, and the related tax impact. Included in the results was a $0.01 per share favorable impact from foreign currency translation due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar versus the pound and a modestly weaker U.S. dollar overall. Turning to the next slide to discuss our strong operational performance. Operating income increased 16% and operating margin improved 170 basis points to 20.3%, compared to the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement primarily reflects $55 million or 240 basis points of savings from restructuring initiatives and other operational improvements before any reinvestment. This was partially offset by $10 million or minus 40 basis points of transaction costs related to recent acquisitions, and $5 million or minus 20 basis points headwind, resulting from lower non-cash pension income. Year-to-date operating income has increased 14% and operating margin has improved 170 basis points compared to the prior year. From a dollar standpoint, operating income has increased $183 million with $109 million driven by savings before reinvestment and $74 million delivered by solid organic revenue growth and core operational improvements, strong progress operationally as we continue to execute against our multiyear investment in the firm. Turning to page 12. I’d like to spend a few moments discussing the investments we’re making to create our next generation global business services model that allows for better scalability, flexibility and enhanced colleague and client experience. These investments are intended to create one operating model with increased operating leverage. Our primary investment areas are across IT, real estate and people. In IT, we expect to create greater insight from data center optimization, application management and strategic vendor consolidation. In real estate, we expect to drive greater collaboration and engagement through real estate portfolio optimization. And in people, we expect to create greater scalability of operations and activity, including the use of centers of excellence and third-party providers. As part of these operating model investments, we plan to invest an estimated $900 million in total cash out of the $3 billion total outsourcing divestiture proceeds. These investments include an estimated $700 million of cash charges expected to be incurred $350 million in 2017; $250 million in 2018, and $100 million in 2019. And an estimated $200 million of incremental CapEx, expected to be incurred $30 million in 2017; $100 million in 2018; and $70 million in 2019. There is an additional estimated $50 million of non-cash charges included as part of asset impairments and lease consolidations. Overall, we expect these investments and other expense discipline initiatives to deliver $400 million of estimated annual savings in 2019, before any potential reinvestments. Following this $900 million investment in our operating model, we are left with approximately $2.1 billion of incremental capital from the outsourcing divestiture proceeds to invest in high-growth, high-margin areas across our portfolio and to return to shareholders. We will deploy this capital to the highest return on invested capital opportunity. As Greg mentioned earlier, we’ve returned approximately $2.1 billion to shareholders year-to-date through share repurchase and dividends. We also announced two significant acquisitions during the quarter, the Townsend Group in our delegated investment management business, and UMG in the Netherlands, which are expected to close in the coming months. With the completion of these two acquisitions and year-to-date activity, we’ve committed over $1 billion of capital to M&A in 2017 in high-growth, high-margin business. Turning to the next page. In the third quarter, we incurred $102 million of restructuring-related charges, relating primarily to workforce reduction, IT and other general initiatives. Year-to-date, we’ve incurred $401 million of restructuring-related charges, representing 53% of the total program estimate. The cash impact year-to-date is an outflow of $199 million. We recognized $55 million of savings in the third quarter, and $109 million of savings year-to-date, representing 73% of the expected savings for the year and 27% of the expected total savings. Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of operations on slide 14. Interest income increased $9 million to $10 million for Q3 compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting additional income earned on the balance of proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing assets. I would note that higher cash balances in the short-term resulting in additional interest income but balances are coming down through the deployment of capital to depending M&A and share repurchase such that we would not expect the same level of interest income going forward. Interest expense was similar at $70 million for Q3. Other expense of $5 million includes $15 million of net losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, partially offset by $10 million of gains primarily related to certain long-term investments. Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, increased to 17.5% compared to 14.2% in the prior year quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the prior year reflects a net favorable impact from certain discrete items. Lastly, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 257.3 million in the third quarter compared to 269.6 million in the prior-year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital. The Company repurchased 5.4 million Class A Ordinary Shares for approximately $750 million in third quarter. The Company has approximately $5.9 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 31st were 250.8 million and there were approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2017 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 256 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. Now, let me turn to the next slide to discuss our solid balance sheet and financial flexibility. At September 30, 2017, cash and short-term investments decreased to $2.4 billion, which continues to reflect higher balances related to the proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing assets. Total debt outstanding was similar at $6 billion. And total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis to continuing operations increased modestly to 3.3 times. As discussed previously, while debt to EBITDA will initially be elevated as a result of the sale of the outsourcing assets, we expect to return back to the 2 to 2.5 times range by the end of 2018, driven by operational improvement. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months decreased $863 million to $289 million, primarily driven by cash tax payments associated with the divestiture, a $199 million of cash restructuring charges and $45 million of transaction costs related to the divestiture, partially offset by operational improvement. Free cash flow, defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, decreased $881 million to $164 million, driven by a decline in cash flow from operations and an $18 million increase in CapEx, including investments to deliver our Aon United operating model. Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the long term. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. We’ve made substantial progress since introducing free cash flow as a key financial metric in 2012, reaching record free cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2016. Our disciplined capital management approach is focused on maximizing return on invested capital, which we’ve consistently improved each year since 2010, increasing 540 basis points to 17.1% in 2016. We expect the recent sale of our outsourcing assets and investments in our Aon United operating model to improve this even further in 2017 and beyond. We have taken significant steps to maximize the translation of each dollar of revenue into the highest amount of free cash flow, including working capital initiatives and actions to manage our cash pension contributions. Since 2010, we’ve increased our free cash flow margin by nearly 1,000 basis points to 18.1% in 2016. Looking forward, there are three primary areas that we expect to continue to contribute to incremental free cash flow generation. The first is continued operational improvement, driven by expected accelerated organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We expect working capital to contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long-term. And third is expected lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate over time. In summary, this was a solid quarter of progress. We delivered strong operational improvement and double-digit earnings growth while continuing to take substantial steps to strengthen our firm over the long term, including investments in high growth areas and in our Aon United operating model. We believe that operational improvement combined with significant financial flexibility from transaction proceeds and underlying free cash flow generation position the firm to deliver on our near-term goal of exceeding $7.97 in adjusted EPS in 2018. More importantly, we believe this reinforces our ability to deliver double-digit annual growth in free cash flow over the long-term, reflecting what we believe is the next significant value-creation opportunity for shareholders. With that I’d like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sarah DeWitt from J.P. Morgan. Ma’am your line is open.
Sarah DeWitt: Hi. Good morning. First, I was wondering if you could just talk about on organic growth, what drove the decline in Commercial Risk Solutions. I think, you mentioned some timing issues. And do you expect that to rebound going forward? And then second, could you just talk about your outlook for PNC insurance pricing, post the active third quarter hurricane season?
Greg Case: Sure, happy to do that, Sarah. As we described, first of all, remember, this is our -- Q3 is our smallest quarter sort of over the course of the year heading into our strongest quarter, the fourth quarter. I talked about it, strong comparable from the Q3 last year of 4%, and essentially said, the timing was really showing up in Q1 and Q3. So, we don’t expect anything coming back in Q4. But, what we really try to highlight is kind of -- if you look at our results, not just in commercial risk but really overall and kind of the year-to-date perspective, this is really where we think sort of as a best assessment overall in terms of where we are, and this we essentially said. If we think year-to-date Q3 ‘15, ‘16, ‘17, we have gone from 2% in ‘15 to 3% in ‘16, 3% in ‘17, and we believe we can continue to accelerate that over time. We see Q3 as a little of a anomaly in the context of all that.
Sarah DeWitt: Pricing…
Greg Case: Pricing piece, I thought you might forget that. [Multiple speakers] Listen, on the pricing side, obviously a lot’s been written and talked about. Our view is -- look, there is just a -- continues to be a tremendous amount of uncertainty out there. The ultimate losses, unclear kind of where they all shake out from time to time, just look at the ranges sort of been published, they’ve been astronomical in terms of sort of how they’ve come in. I would say, from our standpoint, look, we still sit in a very well capitalized industry overall. We described while substantial, more of an earnings event versus a balance sheet event in terms of sort of where we’re over time. But I would highlight from Aon’s perspective, we see this very much on a client by client basis. We’ve invested in substantial data and analytics over time to put us in what we believe is a great position to help our clients, particularly in these kinds of environments. If you look at what we do with Aon Client Treaty for example, these are the types of investments that, frankly, reduce risk work for clients and create opportunity for them. From our standpoint, it’s going to play out over time. Sarah, there is no specific answer at this point. And we’re going to take it client by client as it evolves over time.
Operator: And your next question comes from Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Your line is open. 
Dave Styblo: I just want to go back to operating income. So, if we take the 476 and back out the unfavorable adjustments from pension and M&A transaction costs, and adjust for the $55 million of cost savings, I guess, I get a margin around 18.6% on underlying basis, which should be flat year-over-year. Is that sort of a right way to think about it, or did you guys plough back some of the $55 million of cost savings? And obviously, if you did that, the core margin would show some expansion. So, I’m just trying to understand what’s happening on a fundamental basis, when we exclude some of the larger puts and takes there.
Christa Davies: I think about this on a year-to-date basis because I think quarter-to-quarter, it’s a little lumpy Dave. And frankly, Q3 is our seasonally smallest quarter. And so, if you look at it year-to-date, you can see that OI is up 14% or $183 million. If you look at that $183 million, $109 million of it came from restructuring and $74 million of it came from core operational improvement. So, you’ve basically got 60% of the growth in OI from restructuring savings before reinvestment and 40% of it from core organic revenue growth and margin expansion. So, we feel really good about the operating income growth for the year, and margins for the year are up 170 basis points. So, we’re very pleased with the progress so far.
Greg Case: I might add to that, Dave. If you look at it -- Christa just highlighted really Q3 year-to-date results, Q3 2017, if you did the exact same question in Q2, we’re better against each one of those metrics, as you go from Q2 to Q3. So, it’s plus 14, as Christa described and year-to-date Q3, the year-to-date Q2 was up 12%, we’re up a 170 basis points year-to-date Q3, that was a 160 basis points year-to-date Q2, up 17% EPS that same number was 15% in Q2. So, it’s actually a nice progression. And as we described it, don’t overplay, but a quarter of progress in terms of where we’re. And what you’re seeing is really core performance and operating leverage increasing as we continue to invest in the global business services platform.
Dave Styblo: Okay, got it. And then, on your $150 million of cost savings target, it sounds that’s unchanged for the year. But, if you look at how things are trending, if you just kept the same run rate from 3Q into 4Q, you’re going to be above that range. And I guess, I would assume that as you progress, your cost savings should actually increase. So, are you guys in position where you might actually be trending above your cost savings target for this year or is there something that makes that come down in the fourth quarter?
Christa Davies: Dave, we are exactly on track with the program estimates and we feel really good about the progress so far.
Dave Styblo: So, it sounds like -- I mean, is there a reason why we come down? It sounds like you are holding to the $150 million.
Christa Davies: We are holding $150 million and we will update at year-end.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Sir, your line is open.
Adam Klauber: It looks like you’ve got roughly $2.4 billion or so of cash and short-term securities on the balance sheet. And historically, you hold more like $700 million to $900 million. So, that would suggest you have roughly $1.5 billion extra cash and then for next year, on top of that you have what you generate. Is that the way to think about what you have to deploy for 2018 versus 2017?
Christa Davies: Yes. I think that’s right, Adam. And I guess, what I would say is, as you look at sort of the $2.4 billion, $850 million of it is committed to the M&A we did in the quarter. We did publicly announce those two deals, Townsend and UMG. So, you have $1.6 billion left plus Q4 free cash flow going into 2018.
Adam Klauber: I think you mentioned that tax payments reduced free cash this quarter. How much were those?
Christa Davies: Yes. We haven’t given that number. But, what we can say is that the after tax proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing assets were approximately $3 billion.
Adam Klauber: Okay. And then, you’ve done a couple of good sized deals already in growth areas. Does that mean you have to digest those or do you still have a good pipeline, and is it possible to see some more good deals in 2018?
Greg Case: From our standpoint, listen, we’ve actually done, 19 acquisitions signed closed year-to-date and as Christa described, over a $1 billion committed on the M&A front. We see, again, real opportunities here to add content capability to the overall portfolio. As you’ve heard us say multiple times, so I’ll repeat it here again today, we take a very, very disciplined approach to this. Christa has put in place a return on invested capital framework, cash on cash return; nothing gets through that framework. And in essence, the benchmark is buyback, which we believe is a very, very attractive investment. But, when we find opportunities that exceed buyback, we invest in those. And there is a very substantial robust pipeline, lots of opportunities out there and we see these as kind of add-on acquisitions to the Aon family that content capability that we can scale. Townsend is a terrific example of that and UMG’s [ph] a terrific example of that, Admix in Latin America is a terrific example of that. So, lots of different opportunities for us out there and you’ll continue to see us invest along the framework I described.
Adam Klauber: And finally on Townsend, will that deal be flowing in the fourth quarter? And are the margins at this business generally in line, better or not as good as the overall business.
Christa Davies: We do expect to close both Townsend and UMG in the coming months. We won’t be more specific about timing than that. And they are very attractive businesses. They are high growth, they are high margin and they are high free cash flow generation. And that’s really -- that fits with the overall story of how we are evolving the portfolio. We’re exiting lower growth, lower margin, lower free cash flow generation businesses, and we’re disproportionately investing. And that’s what you have seen in the over $1 billion of M&A that we have committed year-to-date and we are very excited about that.
Greg Case: And we really like, Adam, is -- not only do we like the financial characteristics but what drives that is really the underlying client capability and content characteristics. And each of those bring a unique capability to the table on our behalf and we are going to -- we can then see that across the firm. And this is back to the idea of the catalyst, which is really the -- if we saw the outsourcing business, it generates another level of investment we can put back into the business, both on the acquisition side as well as investing in global business services across Aon to strengthen the firm. So, it really is we think unique opportunity over the coming two to three years, when we think about capital deployment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.
Mike Phillips: It’s actually Mike Phillips here in place of Kai Pan this morning. Couple of questions, one on margins. In the quarter, the 120 basis-point improvement, decent improvement. I guess, with lots of moving parts behind that, one is FX. How much of the FX impact to the margin improvement?
Christa Davies: So, there is no FX impact on margin for the quarter.
Mike Phillips: And then, same thing on margin with the organic growth being what it was, 2%. Does that mean that you can expand the margin, if organic grows even more?
Christa Davies: Yes, we can. And so, what you are seeing, due to the investments we have made in higher growth, higher margin areas over the last few years, our investments in Aon United operating model is we can grow margin at low rates of growth. And so, as Greg said, we do expect to accelerate growth based on the investments we have made. And that’s where you should expect accelerating margin expansion.
Mike Phillips: Lots of brokers are talking about the excitement they have with maybe possible pricing changes and how they can take advantage of that, and you guys are closing the difference. I guess, can you talk about any possible risk to you guys because of the restructuring you’re doing, and possible maybe disruptions to brokers and maybe not to focus on the possible opportunities coming with the possible price changes, is there any risk there?
Greg Case: First of all, Mike, I would just step back. As I described when Sarah asked her question at the beginning, for us, a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of what’s going on. That means there is uncertainty for our clients and that is actually the wheelhouse of Aon. The content capability, analytics we have invested in over time, it literally puts us in a tremendous position. Our clients understand risk, measure risk and mitigate risk. And that’s really what we are doing. I want to also emphasize, the investment we are making back into the firm is a substantial investment. It involves restructuring but it is also investment in a number of areas to strengthen our firm, in technology, things we are doing on the real estate front to create greater client areas to bring our colleagues together. So, a lot is going on across Aon. But it is all fundamentally to make Aon stronger engine, a stronger firm to serve clients. So, I’d go the exact opposite. What we are doing to strengthening our firm, support clients over time and this is another example of a very high stress time for clients, so we can be helpful to them. So, I see exactly the opposite. To us, this is an opportunity to invest to strengthen the firm. And that’s in fact exactly what we are doing.
Mike Phillips: It sounds like you are pretty confident that brokers won’t get distracted or whatever by the restructuring making -- and you don’t see any risk there?
Greg Case: Quite the reverse. Again, I think our team is fully focused on clients 24x7 and that’s what Aon is all about, so don’t see any concern there at all.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O’Neill. Sir, your line is open.
Paul Newsome: I was wondering about where or not the goal to exceed 7.97 next year is dependent upon the current accounting system or the one that we’re going to get next year with the change in revenue recognition? And maybe just a view, an update whether or not you have a view how the revenue recognition might change your financials next year? 
Christa Davies: So, really the impact of 2018 revenue recognition accounting changes is largely immaterial to full year revenue and margin; it’s really going to change the timing by quarter. There will be a significant re-phasing of quarterly revenue within a given year, particularly within reinsurance solutions, but there will be immaterial changes to full year 2018. The other thing I would note is at our Q4 full year 2017 earnings day, we will actually restate 2016 full year and 2017 full year by quarter to give you that detail for the benefit of shareholders.
Paul Newsome: Does it in any way change how we calculate organic growth as well?
Christa Davies: Because we’re going to restate 2016 and 2017, no.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question over to Arash Soleimani from KBW. Sir, your line is open. 
Arash Soleimani: I just wanted to get your thoughts the protection gap in insurance and to what extent you think the events we saw in the third quarter could actually lead to a higher insurance penetration within certain lines of business?
Greg Case: It’s a terrific question. And we’ve talked about that -- the industry has talked about that. These types of events highlight literally sort of individuals and companies that are quite literally uncovered in sort of events and times of trauma. I would say, at Aon, we think about it a little bit differently from a kind of a protection gap. Because if you think about this from the side of a client or an individual customer, we’re essentially saying, we have a gap out there in order for you to actually be in a better position, just buy more of our product. We look at it differentially. We look at it literally as, think about, how capital gets deployed, are there more efficient ways to deploy across the risk spectrum, and we believe there actually is. And there is different products and innovations that come with that. And so, our view is, when you think about kind of the world of risk out there and you recognize sort of how little the penetration is around the world, there is just tremendous opportunities to actually strengthen and build upon that, not just the existing risk like flood which is an obvious one but the new risk like cyber. I mean, again, if you think about cyber right now, there was $450 billion of loss in the U.S. last year, or reported loss in cyber and $2.5 billion or $3 billion in premium. The laws in Europe, which are going to come into effect in May, June of 2018 are going to create another wave of reported loss. How we respond to that to support clients is really a function of how we innovate as an industry. It is also true for the more straightforward coverages like flood and which we got to respond with innovation that actually make that more attractive, different than the current product we’ve got right now. So, we believe there is a very strong set of opportunities to increase the penetration, really serve clients more effectively as they understand, measure, and mitigate risk, but it’s going to require our industry to innovate in order to make that happen.
Arash Soleimani: And just my one other question is since you mentioned cyber, and I know -- we heard a lot of industry estimates of cyber going from $3 billion up to $30 billion in just the matter of years. So, based on what you’ve been seeing in your own books, do you see demand potentially increasing at that level or how do you think about the potential growth opportunity in the next few years?
Greg Case: Again, we look at it -- we do see a substantial growth fully driven by client needs. So, I mean, again, if you think about literally just the $450 billion of reported loss from the U.S., virtually -- I’m saying U.S. because most of it was U.S. reported, that begs the question, is there just no cyber in Europe? Obviously, there is. So, why is it so much smaller? It’s a function of the laws, those are going to change. Therefore, cyber is going to go a number which is some -- many multiples of that. So, we see tremendous opportunity to help clients understand and deal with cyber. And it’s been a source of growth for us, will continue to be a source of growth for us. We’re privileged to be the largest place for this around the world and we’re doubling down our investment in it. Having said that, our industry including Aon, need to continue to innovate on behalf of clients on this category. So, we see this as a substantial opportunity because it’s a substantial source of risk for our clients.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Ma’am your line is open.
Elyse Greenspan: I was hoping to spend -- get a little bit more color in terms of the reinsurance growth. I know, you mentioned that there wasn’t a lot of restatements there. It doesn’t -- was there any kind of one timers that you would point to? It’s obviously the second quarter of pretty strong growth in that business. What’s the outlook there? And then, as we think about margin improvement you saw in the quarter, typically, I would think reinsurance run at better margins and then rest of your business, was that helpful to the level of margin improvement you saw this quarter?
Greg Case: Why don’t I start on the revenue side and Christa you can pick up the margin piece? First of all, on the revenue side, much like we talked about sort of -- we don’t look at the quarter, we look at kind of year-to-date. We’re kind of 5% year-to-date. We think that’s actually great progress. I would come back reflecting on multiple calls over the last few years and just highlight again, we just have a superb team on the reinsurance side, they are tremendously well-positioned to support clients. We’re agnostic on the overall approach, we’re essentially helping our clients again think about ways to understand and control volatility. And what you saw this quarter, it really was record new business on the treaty side. And this is with existing clients but also with new clients to Aon as we gain market share in this arena. Also, we are number one in treaty, number one in facultative placements, and number one in insurance, like securities like et cetera. So, we just got an exceptionally strong position. This team has also taken great efforts to expand the marketplace. If you think about what we’ve done on the mortgage side and literally created net new markets in an area that hadn’t existed before. So, what you see on the reinsurance front is just continued progress from an exceptional team. And again, as I said clients that have lots of need out there to understand and deal with volatility, which is increasing over time. So, it’s just been terrific progress from a very, very strong team in this context. In terms of impact on margin, Christa?
Christa Davies: Yes. So, Elyse, we would say that the margin growth year-to-date of a 170 basis points is really across the whole of Aon. It’s driven by strong growth in each of the five new revenue lines we have margin expansion in each of those areas, and then, underpinned by the investments we are making in the Aon United operating model and the savings we are driving from that. So, it isn’t disproportionately driven by any particular area of the business.
Elyse Greenspan: And then, you guys are a few quarters into this savings plan. I know in the past, you have had several and you had a good track record for seeing saves that have more than exceeded how you initially laid out some of your prior plans. So, a few quarters in, I guess, how are you seeing things as you’re going along with the program? And do you think there is a potential that we could see this be revised up down the road?
Christa Davies: Elyse, we would say we are exactly on track. As I said earlier in the call, we will certainly update at year-end. But, we would say, we are exactly on track with -- to deliver $150 million this year, $300 million next year and $400 million the year after. And we feel very good about the progress.
Elyse Greenspan: And then, in terms of buybacks, the free cash flow was obviously negative in the quarter. How do we think about buybacks here, given that you have these two acquisitions that you are going to close in the near term? And you have obviously come off two quarters of pretty high level of buyback following the divestiture.
Christa Davies: Yes. I mean, what I would say, Elyse, is we have returned, as Greg said, over $2 billion to shareholders year-to-date between buyback and dividends. And we have done $2 billion of buyback roughly so far this year, and we have committed $1 billion to M&A so far this year. I think what you will see in Q4 is more M&A and more buybacks. And it’s all driven by return on capital. As you think about the amount we can deploy, whether it’s on buyback or an M&A, you have got $2.4 billion on the balance sheet with the M&A spend committed of 850, so you’re left with $1.6 billion cash on the balance sheet, plus Q4 free cash flow generation, which is our seasonally strongest quarter of the year. And so, we are very excited about the opportunity to invest in organic opportunities, in M&A, and our highest return on capital opportunity across Aon remains share repurchase.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: I just want to thank everybody for being part of the call today, and look forward to our conversation next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you, speakers. Participants, that concludes today’s conference call. Thank you all participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-08-04 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc Christa Davies - Aon Plc
Analysts: Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC David Styblo - Jefferies LLC Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2017 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Thank you and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today as usual. Before I begin the discussion on our finance results, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about Aon overall, on our work to continuously strengthen our firm, consistent with our record of value creation. This was an exciting quarter for Aon, as we completed significant steps to reinforce and build upon a decade-long strategy to be the leading global professional services firm, providing a broad range of risk, retirement, and health solutions enabled by proprietary data and analytics. In the second quarter, we completed the divestiture of our outsourcing platform, a natural acceleration of our strategy and a tremendous accomplishment made possible by tireless united efforts of our colleagues around the globe. The divestiture provides a further catalyst for our strategy and actions to deliver shareholder value as it reinforces our focus to provide advice and solutions and further aligns Aon's portfolio around our clients' highest priorities. This move also generates approximately $3 billion of additional capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs and in our firm. And finally, the divestiture reinforces our return on invested capital decision making priority and emphasis on free cash flow. Overall, our optimism is built through conviction that the actions we're undertaking will substantially strengthen our firm even further, on the heels of a decade of improvement and innovation for our clients and shareholders. With this momentum, we're already seeing improvement in our growth profile, driven by new investment in high growth, high margin areas across our portfolio. For example, our organic growth has consistently accelerated in the first half of the year from 2% in 2015 to 3% in 2016, to 4% now in 2017. And we're taking further steps to unite Aon with investments to unify and progress toward a single global business services operating model, increasing Aon's efficiency and connectivity. And through one global P&L encompassing all of Aon's industry-leading capabilities, helping us achieve our commitment to deliver all of global Aon to our clients in their local market. Now, turning to the quarter on page five of the presentation. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics, each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting growth across every major revenue line, highlighted by strong growth in Reinsurance and Health Solutions. Operating margin increased 110 basis points, primarily reflecting savings from investments in our Aon United operating model. EPS increased 13% to $1.45, reflecting both strong operating performance and effective capital management, including share repurchase of approximately $1 billion in the quarter. Finally, free cash flow decreased $135 million, primarily reflecting investments in our operating model and transaction related cost, partially offset by operational improvement. Overall, we are fortunate to be operating from a position of strength. Our first half results reflect 4% organic revenue growth, 160 basis points of margin improvement and 16% EPS growth. This momentum, amplified by new initiatives currently underway will substantially strengthen Aon for our clients and colleagues, creating we believe the next wave of shareholder value creation. Turning to slide seven, on the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments. Organic revenue growth was 3% overall in the second quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, on a year-to-date basis, organic revenue growth was 4%, an acceleration from 3% for the first half of 2016, reflecting growth across all five revenue lines with particular strength in Health Solutions and Reinsurance Solutions. Reflecting on each of our core growth platforms, in Commercial Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2%. On average globally, exposures were modestly positive and the impact from pricing was stable, resulting in a modestly favorable market impact overall. Results reflect strong growth across the Pacific region in both Australia and New Zealand and solid growth in the U.S. and Canada. In U.S. Retail, new business increased over 20% in the quarter and strong management of the renewal book portfolio drove retention of 93% on average. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in Latin America and Asia, as both these regions continue to face challenging macroeconomic conditions. In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 6%, an acceleration from flat in the prior-year quarter. I would note that this is the highest level of organic revenue growth achieved in our Reinsurance business in nearly five years. Results primarily reflect strength in capital markets transaction and advisory for record cat bonds during the mid-year renewal season. Continued growth in facultative placements and net new business generation in treaty also contributed to growth in the quarter. Results were partially offset by modest unfavorable market impact, primarily in the Americas. Our Reinsurance business continues to deliver improved growth. And while the first half of the year is expected to be stronger than the second half, we would expect full year organic revenue growth to exceed the level achieved in 2016. Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was 1%. We saw continued strong growth in investment consulting, specifically for delegated investment management services, reflecting an increase in client demand for Aon's tailored solutions and independent advice, as well as improved market performance. Assets under management and delegated investment management reached $109 billion in the quarter, of which roughly half of the increase since last quarter was a result of new client wins. We also saw growth in our strategic advisory business, where our trusted advisors bring solutions to clients undergoing business change or transition. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in our talent practice driven by unfavorable timing in the quarter and a decline in project related work. In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5%. Results primarily reflect solid growth in health and benefits brokerage across the U.S. and EMEA, and double-digit growth across Asia. New business in Asia increased over 30% in the quarter, a great reflection of the depth and breadth of our global capability. In Data & Analytics Services, organic revenue growth was 4%. Results primarily reflect strong growth in our Affinity business, with particular strength in the U.S. Growth in U.S. Affinity was highlighted by exceptionally strong performance in pet, travel and financial solutions. Now turning to slide eight to discuss areas of strategic investment. Clients are navigating an increasingly volatile world where economic, demographic and geopolitical shifts combined with the exponential pace of technology change are all converging to create a challenging new reality for businesses. Aon has a strong track record of developing innovative, first-to-market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs. We're investing organically and through M&A across our portfolio in areas such as Data & Analytics, in our Inpoint and Re/View businesses; cyber risk advisory through our recent acquisition of Stroz Friedberg; Affinity, in multiple areas; health and elective benefits brokerage through the acquisition of Admix in Latin America and Univers; health exchanges, where we offer the broadest set of solutions in health; and finally, in delegated investment management solutions, where we continue to grow substantially. Overall, our strategic investments in high growth areas and in Data & Analytics are improving the firm's growth profile driven by new business generation, strong retention rates, and increased operating leverage across the portfolio, and we believe positioning the firm for continued long-term growth. In summary, we took significant steps to strengthen our industry-leading, global professional services platform and delivered strong operational performance for both the second quarter and the first half of 2017. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Thanks very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. The actions we currently have underway place us in a position of strength to unlock the next wave of shareholder value creation. In the second quarter, our colleagues around the world jointly accomplished a significant step of our journey with the completion of the sale of our outsourcing business, a tremendous amount of work and dedication from the global team. Against that backdrop, in Q2, we delivered organic revenue growth across every major revenue line, strong operational improvement and double-digit earnings growth, highlighted by the repurchase of $1 billion of shares in the quarter. Turning to slide 10 of the presentation. Our core EPS from continuing operations excluding certain items increased 13% to $1.45 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.28 in the prior-year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 11 and 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization, which includes an impairment charge on intangible assets related to the sale of our outsourcing business, restructuring charges, charges related to certain regulatory and compliance matters and non-cash expenses related to pension (10:56) settlements in the prior-year quarter. Included in the results was a $0.02 per share favorable impact related to foreign currency translation due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar versus the pound and a modestly weaker U.S. dollar overall. Additionally, we incurred $0.02 per share unfavorable impact recognized through other expense from losses on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no material impact in the second half of the year. Lastly, EPS from discontinued operations excluding the gain on sale was $0.08 of total earnings per share attributable to Aon's shareholders compared to $0.22 in the prior year quarter. Results in the second quarter reflect one month of results compared to three months in the prior year as our transaction closed on May 1. Turning to the next slide to discuss our strong operational performance. Operating income increased 9% and operating margin improved 110 basis points to 22.4%, compared to the prior year. Operating margin improvement primarily reflects $44 million or 190 basis points of savings and underlying operational improvements before reinvestments. Initial savings have been driven primarily by workforce reduction, IT rationalization, vendor consolidation and travel optimization globally. Results in the quarter were partially offset by a minus 40 basis point headwind in errors and omissions expense and a minus 20 basis point headwind resulting from lower non-cash pension income. For the first half of 2017, operating income increased 12% and operating margin improved 160 basis points from the first half of 2016, primarily driven by organic revenue growth, $54 million of savings from restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives before reinvestment; a strong first half of the year operationally as we kick off our multiyear investment in the firm. Turning to page 12. I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the investments we're making to create the next generation global business services model that allows for better scalability, flexibility and enhanced colleague and client experience. These investments are intended to create one operating model with increased operating leverage. Our primary investment areas are across IT, real estate and people. In IT, we expect to create greater insight from data center optimization, application management and strategic vendor consolidation. In real estate, we expected to drive greater collaboration and engagement through real estate portfolio optimization. And in people, we expect to create efficient scalability of operations and activity including the use of centers of excellence and third-party providers. As part of these operating model investments, we plan to invest an estimated $900 million of total cash out of the $3 billion total outsourcing divestiture proceeds. These investments include an estimated $700 million of cash charges expected to be incurred; $350 million in 2017, $250 million in 2018, and $100 million in 2019. And an estimated $200 million of incremental CapEx, expected to be incurred $30 million in 2017, $100 million in 2018, and $70 million in 2019. There is an additional estimated $50 million of non-cash charges included as part of asset impairments and lease consolidations. Overall, we expect these investments and other expense discipline initiatives to deliver $400 million of estimated annual savings in 2019, before any potential reinvestments. Following this $900 million investment in our operating model, we have approximately $2.1 billion of incremental capital left from the outsourcing divestiture proceeds to invest in high growth, high margin areas across our portfolio and to return to shareholders. Turning to the next page. In the second quarter, we incurred $155 million of restructuring related charges, primarily related to workforce reduction. Year-to-date, we've incurred $299 million of restructuring related charges representing 40% of the total program estimate. The cash impact year-to-date is an outflow of $94 million. We recognized $44 million of savings in the second quarter, and $54 million of savings year-to-date, representing 36% of the savings for the year and 14% of the expected total savings estimate. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of operations on slide 14. Interest income increased $5 million to $8 million for Q2, reflecting additional income earned on proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing business. Interest expense decreased $2 million to $71 million for Q2, due to a modest decrease in total debt outstanding. Other expense of $5 million, or minus $0.02 per share, primarily includes losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities and non-functional currencies. Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, increased to 15.6% compared to 14.9% in the prior year quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate reflects a net favorable impact from certain discrete items in both periods. Similar to Q1, excluding the impact of discrete items, the underlying non-GAAP rate would have been approximately 17.5%. Lastly, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 3% to $262.4 million in the second quarter compared to $269.8 million in the prior-year quarter as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased $8 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $1 billion in second quarter. The company has $6.7 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30, with 255.7 million and are approximately 4 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q3 2017 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 260 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to discuss our solid balance sheet and financial flexibility. At June 30, 2017, cash and short-term investments increased to $3.4 billion, primarily reflecting the collection of proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing business. Total debt outstanding decreased modestly to $5.9 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis for continuing operations decreased to 3.2 times. As discussed previously, while debt to EBITDA will be initially elevated as a result of the sale of the outsourcing business, we expect to return back to the 2 times to 2.5 times range by the end of 2018, driven by operational improvement. Cash flow from operations for the first six months decreased $121 million to $436 million, primarily driven by $94 million of cash restructuring charges and $44 million of transaction related costs, partially offset by operational improvement. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, decreased $135 million to $354 million, driven by a decline in cash flow from operations and a $14 million increase in CapEx, including investments to deliver our Aon United operating model. Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the long-term. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow return. We've made substantial progress since introducing free cash flow as a key financial metric in 2012, reaching record free cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2016. Our disciplined capital management approach is focused on maximizing return on invested capital, which we've consistently improved each year since 2010, increasing 540 basis points to 17.1% in 2016. The recent sale of our outsourcing businesses and investments in our Aon United operating model are expected to improve this even further. We have also taken significant steps to maximize the translation of each dollar of revenue into the highest amount of free cash flow, including working capital initiatives and actions to manage our cash pension contributions. Since 2010, we've increased our free cash flow margin by nearly 1,000 basis points to 18.1% in 2016. Looking forward, there are three primary areas that we expect to continue to contribute to incremental free cash flow generation. The first is continued operational improvement, driven by accelerated organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We expect working capital to contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long-term. And third is expected lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate over time. In summary, second quarter results reflect a strong performance, when considering the substantial amount of activity and steps we took to strengthen the firm. Through the first half, we've accelerated organic revenue growth, driven by our investments in high growth areas, and improved operational leverage through investments in our Aon United operating model. Operational performance combined with significant financial flexibility from transaction proceeds and underlying free cash flow generation positions the firm to deliver on our near-term goal of exceeding $7.97 adjusted EPS in 2018. More importantly, this reinforces our ability to deliver double-digit annual cash flow growth over the long-term, reflecting what we believe is the next significant value creation opportunity for shareholders. With that I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Hi Sarah.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: First on the organic growth, given all the investments you're making and that you discussed, how should we think about how much incremental organic growth those investments could drive over the longer-term?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Sure. From our standpoint, first, if you step back and think about progress, you're already starting to see in our view some leverage coming from the investments we're making, we've made historically in areas like the Exchanges, in areas like cyber, in areas like data and analytics and the work on the Risk Insight Platform. And if you think about it, Christa and I both highlighted this, in the first six months, reflecting back in 2017, 4% growth versus the first six months in 2016, which was 3% versus the first six months in 2015 which was 2%. So, in essence you're starting to see, as Christa highlighted, a portfolio which has got greater and better growth characteristics than we've had before. So, you're going to continue to see that progression. Obviously we're not going to give guidance on this other than to say we expect to see greater growth potential in Aon going forward from the investments we're making, but also from the portfolio changes we've made with the divestiture of our outsourcing business.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just on the margin, you had strong year-over-year expansion this quarter. However, if you take out the expense savings and the pension and the E&O impact, it implies that the margins slightly contracted year-over-year. Is that just because of seasonality, where I think in the first three quarters of the year you don't have much margin expansion and then most of the underlying expansion comes in the fourth quarter or is there something else going on?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So Sarah, what I would say is, as you look at the first half of 2017, operating income is up $117 million, of which $54 million of that is coming from savings from the restructuring program. So, if you think about it, operating income is up 12% for the first half of the year year-over-year and then excluding savings it's up 6%. So we do see strong growth in operational performance on an underlying basis. So we feel really good with the first half performance on an underlying basis.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Is there any seasonality we should be thinking about in terms of the quarterly growth?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Not really. I mean, as you said, Q1 and Q4 are seasonally stronger quarters for us and that continues to be true.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I just want to talk about visibility for the rest of the year. Do you guys have stats or keep stats on how much of your expected revenue you've got locked in on this point, and maybe an update along with retention that would go towards that? And specifically, I want to ask a little bit more about the Reinsurance business. Obviously you've had some good results on the organic side. And just in canvassing the news, I'm picking up that you guys have won several accounts, especially down in Florida with People's Trust, Capitol and Argo Group outside there. Is there something – maybe those are isolated wins and it's just part of the portfolio that moves it up and down, but is there any sort of shift that you guys are seeing in terms of new wins or progress either in Florida or more broadly across that book?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Well, I'd say first of all, David, your first question around visibility into the rest of the year on revenue and organic growth, look, we continue to make investments to strengthen the firm as Sarah highlighted on the last question. Remember, this business, I highlighted in our Commercial Risk business a 93% plus retention business. So from that standpoint, a pretty sticky business. That gives us a lot of visibility into what happens in the second half and what happens throughout the year for that matter. Still, doesn't mean we don't invest heavily to try to drive that up, but we've got a lot of visibility in what that baseline looks like. So happy to come back to that, but a lot of visibility there. On the Reinsurance side, listen, to us this is just a continuation of what our team has done. We've got an exceptionally strong team on the Reinsurance side. We continue to add talent, but we start from a unique position. We're the number one player in treaty, number one player in fac, number one player in ILS. And we've encountered a number of headwinds over the years as it relates to the pricing, particularly in the U.S., particularly in U.S. property, particularly in U.S. property cat where we're number one in all those and yet our team, against that headwind over the last number of years has done nothing short of just keep investing in innovation. And you've seen us do things in mortgage; you've seen us do things in other areas that no one else has done to actually create new markets and new capacity, new opportunities, and you're seeing us be able to react to client needs around reducing volatility, improve returns and help them grow. That really is just unmatched from that standpoint. And so for us, that need from a client standpoint is very high. We keep investing to do that and you saw us in the quarter deliver what has been 6%, probably close to the highest we've been in a long, long time. But really, again, consistent with our conversation, we wouldn't look at the quarter. We'd say in the first half, we've delivered 4% in the first half and we look for continued progress on the reinsurance side. It candidly draws from the strength of the team and what we can do on behalf of clients.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then on capital deployment, you guys obviously stepped up the buybacks in the second quarter there. Is that maybe about as high as you'd like to go in a given quarter for the pace of buybacks and maybe it steps out a little bit in the back half of the year, or what's dictating that versus potential M&A opportunities in the pipeline that you look at? I know you guys have characterized M&A pipeline as something that you'll probably do similar deals to what you've done in the past and be selective with those. But curious how the M&A opportunities might balance what you're doing in terms of share buybacks given all the cash on the books right now.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Well Dave, as you know, we do think about allocating cash on a return on capital basis. That is the way we allocate cash between share repurchase, M&A, organic investment or any other use of cash. And as we think about that the highest return on capital across the firm remains share repurchase which is why you've seen us do $1 billion of share repurchase in Q2. As we think about use of cash for the balance of the year, you can see we've got $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. We are generating substantial free cash flow in the second half of the year. It's our seasonally strongest half of the year, and so we have tremendous capital flexibility. And we do see us continuing our share repurchase given the exceptional return on capital that generates. We also have a very attractive pipeline in M&A. It's probably the most significant it's ever been historically and so we expect to continue M&A, and so I think you'll see a mix of uses across the portfolio.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, and good morning. My first question is on the restructuring program. You spent almost like 40% of total program cost in the quarter. Can you talk a bit more in detail about the action that have been taken? I'm also wondering has this restructuring has any temporary impact in term of disruption of your business like organic growth?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yeah. So Kai, what we would say is the overall purpose of the program is to create the next generation operating model for AON, bringing together everything into one operating model for AON. We call it AON United. And we're bringing together one operating model across the firm to drive greater operating leverage and to deliver additional insight, connectivity and efficiency, primarily in IT, in real estate and in people. If you think about the 40% of the restructuring charge we've used year-to-date, it's primarily been in workforce reduction and we do think about that as setting up the future operating model of Aon. Longer term, because it takes longer to come through, you'll see more IT and you'll see more real estate. We don't believe this is having a disruption to the firm. If you look at the first half revenue growth as Greg highlighted, we've accelerated revenue growth 2% in the first half of 2015, 3% in the first half of 2016, and 4% in the first half of 2017. And so we do believe actually bringing together Aon under Aon United will help generate benefits for clients, because we're bringing together a common approach for clients which we think is going to be exceptional.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. My second question is on the regulatory front. Do you have any updates on FCA investigation, the PRA like look into the market in the London market? As well there is a recent report from FCA on investment consultant. I just appreciate your updated view on this.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Yeah, happy to talk about both of those, Kai. On the first piece, first overall, you know how seriously we take compliance and regulatory matters, and will continue to do so. Certainly focused on the FCA and what they're looking at. We took a $34 million charge in the second quarter for regulatory matters that are part of this, subject to this investigation. We obviously can't comment much further on that, but we're going to continue to work that arena very, very strongly and again, take it very, very seriously. On the asset management side on the FCA from that standpoint, this is an area they're looking at overall, and really they're evaluating fiduciary standards which we do today. What we would say and this is listen, this is any place we can create more client transparency, opportunity for more client value, we're very much in favor of and you will see us supporting in every way we possibly can.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning. Hi everyone. Two questions. How is the Cyber with Stroz, how is that business doing? Is it growing? And then also how's Inpoint doing?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: I'm sorry. The second question, Adam was?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Inpoint.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Oh, sure.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Inpoint. Excellent. Thank you. Got it. So, on Cyber overall and Stroz, again remember you have to take a step back. We had a very strong position in Cyber, exceptionally strong, disproportionate share of the overall placement in the market, and our colleagues said listen, although we've got this position and it's growing nicely, when you think about overall client need, it really is outstripping where the insurance industry is, and by the way, the industry, that's really all of us. So, we're not pointing fingers. We're really looking at Aon and saying how can we actually change that? And again, if you look at the reported loss in cyber or cyber-related items, it's $450 billion plus in the U.S., and by the way, the European theater is now just opening up as the regulation begins to change. So you're about to see a number which is going to get close to $1 trillion plus in cyber reported loss and yet the insurance world is about $2.5 billion to $3 billion in premium overall. And so when we looked at that we said, look, why is that? And what we saw was it was difficult and hard for balance sheets or insurance partners to actually apply capital against cyber without a better understanding of the root cause and the drivers of it. And so we went about bringing in capability and talent really to address that on top of what we have today before. And so from our standpoint, it is really a real opportunity for us to serve clients in a very, very effective way. And we're really doing a set of things in cyber that help redefine the marketplace to create opportunities to bring more capital in. So it's been exceptionally strong and we're looking forward to next steps, really in terms of what we can do on behalf of clients. So Cyber is very, very positive with lots of opportunity and a lot to do. On the second piece on Inpoint, what I'd really like to talk about is the category, which is really Data & Analytics. What we've got from that standpoint is a broad set of relationships we developed over time, many of them underpinned by true content, true insight on Data & Analytics. And what we see, and Inpoint's part of this, but really the whole category in Data & Analytic Services is really an opportunity for us to actually bring Data & Analytics to the table in a way in which you help clients understand risk differently, mitigate risk differently, understand opportunities, reduce volatility in a unique way and that's why we are so excited about the whole category of Data & Analytic Services, of which Inpoint is part of.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Just one follow-up, is it possible to see deals in one of those two categories, given such a bright future?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Yeah. Listen, you're going to see us invest, as Christa said before, in areas where we think we can apply capital to improve return on invested capital and serve clients. So you'll see us think about areas where we can bring in content and capability irrespective of – the revenue lines we've broken out, we're very excited about each and every one of them, all of them going through transitions and change as we invest in and around it. And you're going to see that in Data & Analytic Services, you're going to see that in Health, you're seeing that in Retirement, seeing that in Reinsurance and you're certainly going to see it on the Commercial Risk side.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Great. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. I first had a question, a follow-up on the margin improvement you guys saw in the quarter. You guys saw underlying revenue growth of 3%. I calculate your underlying adjusted expenses grew about 2% in the quarter. I think what's hard for us to see is how much of the margin improvement is being driven by your revenue growth exceeding your expense growth versus just the savings program falling to the bottom line. Because I know you call out the $44 million of savings in the quarter, but how much of that hit your margins versus how much margin improvement are you seeing from your core business? And I would think, given the pickup in Reinsurance growth in the quarter, that would have been beneficial to your margin, since it's a pretty high margin business. Just a little bit of more color there?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So, what I would say, Elyse, is as we think about the quarter, there are lots of things that happen that are lumpy in a quarter, and I would go back to the first half of the year, because it's a much clear trend, and frankly it's much more indicative for full year 2017. And so as you look at the first half of the year, you do see operating income up $117 million, which included $54 million of savings. And so as you think about operating income growth year-over-year, 12%, excluding savings 6%, so that's giving you your underlying operating income growth. And we are getting underlying margin expansion as well, and so we do feel very good about the operational improvement in the first half of the year, which is on track for full year performance.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then is there any way – I mean, we have $100 million of expense saves coming in the second half of the year. If you could help us think through, I mean, what percent fell through, fell to the bottom line in the second quarter and how you're thinking about more saves potentially falling in the back half of the year that could lead to stronger margin improvement?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yeah. So, what we have said, Elyse, is that the $44 million of savings we had in Q2 was before reinvestment. We are absolutely going to invest in high growth areas that drive expansion of margin and growth in free cash flow, and you can see those investments that we're making over the last couple of years have contributed to our accelerated organic revenue growth. And so we aren't going to give guidance in the second half of the year. We have said for full year 2017 that our savings for 2017 will be $150 million, but we haven't given guidance on what percentage we will reinvest.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Can you let us know, how much shares have you guys bought back quarter to-date?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So, we don't give guidance on shares. What we can say is we bought $1 billion of shares in Q2. And as I mentioned on a previous question, as we think about the balance of the year, we've got $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments sitting on the balance sheet. We're generating substantial free cash flow in the second half of the year. The second half of the year is our strongest free cash flow half. And as we invest that cash, our highest return on capital opportunity remains share repurchase. And so we expect to continue to repurchase stock in the second half of the year.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is now open.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Yeah. Just a couple quick numbers questions here for you. On the Reinsurance business, the capital market stuff can be really, really lumpy. Is it possible to get what the benefit to organic revenue growth was in the quarter from the cat bond and capital markets?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Brian, we really, as I said before, really don't look at it that way. And again, we're essentially helping clients to improve return on their own capital, whether it's from cat bonds or treaty or fac and all the different pieces around that. So we really look at them together and it was certainly a strong part of the quarter for us, as I highlighted, given the position we've got. We've got a very strong position in this category. But we've got strong positions in the other categories as well.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then, a second question. Christa, I'm just curious, the pension headwind that you had in the quarter, is that going to persist here for the rest of the year?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Last question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, thank you. Just a question. On page 12 of the slide deck, you talk about the $900 million of investments you plan on making, but then you also talk about reinvesting potentially some of the savings. What's the difference between the initial investment, $900 million, and then any potential reinvestment?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Well, so Jay the $900 million is really a restructuring charge. It's a one-time charge to generate the savings. So if you think about the return on capital, that you're investing $900 million in cash and you're generating $400 million of savings. So that's the way we think about the return on invested capital of that particular exercise. And there's a separate exercise which is, as we come across terrific growth opportunities, and Greg talked about several of them, whether it's data analytics, whether it's health and elective benefits, whether it's delegated investment management, then we will look at those as separate exercises and we will invest organically to get a return in those businesses. And you've seen them generate an acceleration in our organic revenue growth, they contribute to margin expansion and they particularly contribute to our double-digit free cash flow growth that we expect to do annually going forward. And so, what I would say is, we don't expect all of the $400 million of savings to fall to the bottom line, but we certainly expect the reinvestment in savings to generate accelerated revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow growth going forward.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: One of the things, Jay, as you look at what we have done, put them in the second quarter, it really, for us, is just an example of our reinforcement of the overall game plan and that's reflected in the first half performance. If you think about the Aon of 2016 versus the Aon of the future, we believe as you look at that picture, that from two, it's a pretty compelling picture. The Aon of 2016 delivered 16% TSR for a decade, which is fine, but we expect the Aon of the future, as we go through the restructuring, as we invest, continue to invest in organic opportunities, is going to deliver the near-term EPS expectations you all have, but we're going to end up with a platform that's higher growth, higher margin, higher ROIC, higher free cash flow growth and higher operating leverage that's going to support future improvement and it's going to put us, as Christa described, fully on track to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth over the long-term. So, that's the program we've undertaken. That's what we're very excited about and we see the first half of the year fully reflecting that progress.
Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. That's helpful. Last question. You talk about going forward, one source of additional cash flow is a lower tax rate over time. Your tax rate is so much lower than any competitor. Clearly your structure's a bit different too, but how much lower can the tax rate go from here?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Well Jay, what I would point out though is what you saw with our non-GAAP tax rate in Q2 of 15.6% was that was impacted favorably by positive discretes. And so, excluding those positive discretes, the underlying non-GAAP rate would have been approximately 17.5% for Q2 and that is exactly the same as what we said, the underlying rate, underlying non-GAAP rate would have been approximately 17.5% for Q1 this year too. And so, what we do think is there is opportunity over the long-term to reduce that rate, but in addition to that, there's the timing of the cash rate and the effective tax rate over time and the cash rate is slightly above the effective tax rate today and it will come down to equally effective tax rate over time and accelerate free cash flow growth doing that.
Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That's good clarification. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Ashley, thanks very much. Just want to say to everyone thanks very much for joining the call and we look forward to our discussion next quarter. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2017 results as well as having been posted in our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Before I begin the discussion on our finance results, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about Aon overall and our efforts to continuously strengthen the firm, consistent with our record of value creation. Let me start by saying, it's an exciting time for Aon, as we're reinforcing and building upon a proven decade long strategy to be the leading global professional services firm, providing a broad range of risk, retirement, and health solutions using proprietary data and analytics. We're privileged to take these new initiatives I will describe on the heels of a decade of improvement and innovation for our clients and shareholders. For our clients, NPS scores are at their highest levels since we began tracking them with strong client satisfaction and retention. For our shareholders, 10 plus years averaging 16% annual shareholder returns. And we finished 2016 with accelerating organic growth, record operating margin, and record free cash flow exceeding $2.1 billion. We feel very fortunate to have real momentum. But we also share our conviction today on that, momentum never sleeps. We must continuously innovate faster than our clients in our areas of expertise to add value. The Outsourcing platform divestiture provides a catalyst for our actions. As it is consistent with our focus in strategy to deliver advice and solutions and further aligns Aon's portfolio around our clients' highest priorities. It strengthens our ability to make new investments in high growth, high margin areas across our portfolio. It reinforces our return on invested capital, ROIC, decision making process and emphasis on free cash flow. And it provides approximately $3 billion of capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs. We're excited because the actions we are undertaking, we believe, will further strengthen our firm, including operating as one global P&L to strengthen our client serving capability by helping us achieve our commitment to deliver all of Aon's global capabilities locally. Providing greater transparency into our highest growth platforms through five revenue lines, more fully reflecting how our team thinks about our business. Investing $900 million back into our business to unify and improve our business services operating model, including technology, real estate, and our colleague experience. The outcome of this work is designed to result in a substantially stronger firm with higher growth in top line, bottom line, and free cash flow. In short, Aon ends up stronger than ever before with over $2 billion of incremental dollars to invest back into Aon. Continuing to reinforce and strengthen our free cash flow operating model, which has been very effective in strengthening the cash flow margins of our firm, thereby enabling more investment back into Aon. These actions reinforced our industry leading platform, highlighted by leadership positions in each of our five revenue lines, Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Retirement Solutions, Health Solutions, and Data & Analytic Services. And more than $120 billion of premium placed annually, an unprecedented level of data from which to drive insight on behalf of clients through our InPoint, ReView, and Affinity technology platforms. $4 trillion of assets under advisory, providing the basis for strong growth in our delegated investment consulting platform. And finally, the reflection of our client value, strong retention rates greater than 90%. Overall, the momentum we already enjoy, amplified by the new initiatives currently underway is expected to substantially strengthen Aon for our clients, colleagues, and shareholders. And we believe represents the next wave of shareholder value creation. Now turning to the quarter on page 6. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon's industry leading portfolio of capabilities. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase our earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth. In the first quarter organic revenue growth was 4% overall, the strongest rate of organic revenue growth to start the year since 2012, reflecting growth across the entire portfolio, including double digit growth in Health Solutions. Operating margin increased 220 basis points, primarily reflecting strong organic revenue growth and return on investments across our portfolio, as well as expense savings from restructuring activities and other operational initiatives. EPS increased 20% to $1.45, primarily reflecting strong operating performance, a lower effective tax rate, and effective capital management. And free cash flow increased $41 million or 38%, primarily reflecting strong operational improvement, partially offset by investments in our operating model. Overall, our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the year with positive performance across each of our key metrics. Turning to slide 8. On the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments. Organic revenue growth was 4% overall, an acceleration from 2% in the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth across all five revenue lines, with particular strength in Health Solutions and Data & Analytics Services. Reflecting on each of our core growth platforms. In Commercial Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. On average globally, exposures were modestly positive and the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulted in a relatively flat market impact overall. Results reflect solid growth internationally across EMEA, Asia, and the Pacific regions. And U.S. Retail, new businesses increased over 10% in the quarter. And strong management of the renewable portfolio drove retention rates of 93% on average. Results were partially offset by a decline in Latin America, primarily related to unfavorable timing impact in the quarter. In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2%, an acceleration from flat in the prior year quarter. Results reflect growth across every product line, including particular strength in capital markets transactions and advisory, continued net new business generation in treaty, and growth in facultative placements also contributed to growth in the quarter. Results were partially offset by a modest unfavorable market impact globally. Similar to prior discussions, overall market conditions are improving, as price declines continue to moderate year over year and cedent demands continue to increase against record levels of capital. In Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3%, an acceleration from 2% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect growth across every major practice. We saw continued growth in investment consulting, specifically for delegated investment management services, reflecting an increase in client demand for Aon's tailored solution and independent advice, as well as improved market performance. The team surpassed the $100 billion mark of pension assets under delegated management, a real milestone. We also saw growth across our talent practice, primarily for compensation surveys and engagement services. In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was 14%, an acceleration from 1% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect solid growth globally in health and benefits brokerage, including double digit growth across the Asia and EMEA regions. Latin America also delivered solid growth in the quarter, following the recent acquisition of Admix in Brazil. New business for global health and benefits brokerage increased 6% in the quarter. And strong management of the renewal book portfolio drove retention rates greater than 94% on average. Results also reflect double digit growth in healthcare exchanges, primarily driven by follow-on enrollments on the active exchange and certain project related work. In Data & Analytic Services, organic revenue growth was 5%, similar to the prior year quarter. Results primarily reflect strong growth across our global Affinity business, highlighted by double digit growth in the U.S. We saw growth across all product lines in U.S. Affinity, with particular strength in areas across consumer solutions like travel and financial solutions. Overall, we delivered solid growth to start the year, driven by high demand areas where we continue to invest in innovative solutions and client serving capabilities. Turning to slide 9. Clients are navigating in an increasingly volatile world, where economic, demographic, and geopolitical landscapes, combined with the exponential pace of technology change, are all converging to create a challenging new reality for businesses. Aon has a strong track record of developing innovative, first-to-market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs. We're investing organically and through M&A across our portfolio in areas such as Data & Analytics, our InPoint and ReView businesses; cyber risk advisory, the recent acquisition of Stroz Friedberg; Affinity; health and elective benefits brokerage, Admix in Latin America and Univers; health exchanges, where we offer the broadest set of solutions in health; and delegated investment management. Overall, our strategic investments in high growth areas and in Data & Analytics continue to drive new business generation, strong retention rates, and increased operating leverage across the portfolio, positioning the firm for continued long term growth. In summary of our performance, our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the year, driven by investments in our client serving capabilities and operating model. We're accelerating a proven strategy, which has been delivering exceptional results for clients and shareholders for over a decade. With significant financial flexibility to invest across our industry leading portfolio, our operating model, and to return capital to shareholders, we believe we're at the beginning of the next substantial wave of value creation for shareholders. I'm now pleased to turn the call over Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Thanks very much, Greg. And good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, we just completed a meaningful next step in the firm's decade long strategy. We are operating from a position of strength to unlock the next wave of shareholder value creation. Our first quarter performance reflects accelerated organic revenue growth, substantial operating improvement, and 38% growth in free cash flow over Q1 2016. An exceptional start to the year, given the incredible effort by colleagues across the firm to complete the divestiture. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on slide 11 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance from continuing operations excluding certain items increased 20% to $1.45 per share for the first quarter, compared to $1.21 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 10 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization and restructuring charges. Included in the results was a $0.01 per share unfavorable impact related to FX translation, due primarily to U.S. dollar strength against the euro. In addition, we incurred a $0.03 per share unfavorable impact recognized through other expenses from losses on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an immaterial impact for the rest of the year. Further, discontinued operations represent an additional $0.18 of total earnings per share attributable to Aon shareholders in both Q1 2016 and Q1 2017. Total EPS attributable to Aon shareholders including both continuing and discontinued operations increased 17% from $1.39 to $1.63 in the first quarter of 2017. Turning to the next slide to discuss our strong operational performance. Operating income increased 16% and operating margin increased 220 basis points to 22.3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement reflects organic revenue growth across the portfolio, including strong growth in high demand areas of continued investment, as well as $12 million or 50 basis points of favorable impact from reduced expenses related to certain hedging programs, as a result of actions undertaken due to reduced ongoing transactional exposure to the Indian rupee post the sale of the Outsourcing businesses; $11 million or 40 basis points of savings related to restructuring and other expense discipline initiatives; and a 30 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Turning to page 13. I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the investments we're making to create a next-generation global business services model that allows for better scalability, flexibility, and enhanced colleague and client experience. These investments are intended to create one operating model with increased operating leverage. Our primary investment areas are across IT, real estate, and people. In IT, we expect to create greater insight from data center optimization, application management, and strategic vendor consolidation. In real estate, we expect it to drive greater collaboration and engagement through real estate portfolio optimization. And in people, we expect to create efficient scalability of operations and activity, including the use of centers of excellence and third party providers. As part of these operating model investments, we plan to invest an estimated $900 million in total cash out of the $3 billion total Outsource divestiture proceeds. These investments include $700 million of cash charges – expected to be incurred $350 million in 2017, $250 million in 2018, and $100 million in 2019 – and $200 million of incremental CapEx investment – expected to be incurred $30 million in 2017, $100 million in 2018, and $70 million in 2019. There is an additional $50 million of non-cash charges included as part of asset impairments and lease consolidations. Overall, we expect these investments to deliver $400 million of estimated annual savings in 2019, including an estimated $150 million in 2017 and $300 million in 2018. Following this $900 million investment in our operating model, we have approximately $2.1 billion of incremental capital left from the Outsourcing divestiture proceeds to invest in high growth, high margins areas across our portfolio and to return to shareholders. Turning to the next page. In our first quarter, we incurred $144 million of restructuring related charges, primarily related to workforce reduction, representing 19% of the total program estimates. The cash impact in the first quarter was an outflow of $31 million. We recognized $11 million of savings in the quarter, representing 7% of the expected savings within the year and 3% of the total savings estimate. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of operations on slide 15. Interest income was $2 million. Interest expense increased $1 million to $70 million due to a modest increase in total debt outstanding. Other expense of $10 million or $0.03 per share primarily includes losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. Separately, unallocated expenses are now included in overall operating income as we manage one P&L across the firm going forward. Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with amortization, restructuring charges, and anticipated non-cash pension settlements in the fourth quarter decreased to 11.1%, compared to 15.7% in the prior year quarter. Our rate of 11.1% in the first quarter primarily reflects a $29 million benefit from the required change in accounting for share based compensation. The new accounting guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax efficiencies to be recognized as income tax expense and treated as discrete items against the underlying operating rate in the period in which the granted shares vest. Excluding the impact from this accounting change, the rate in Q1 would has been 17.5%. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 2% to 267 million in the first quarter compared to 273.7 million in the prior year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased 1.1 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $125 million in the quarter. The company has $7.7 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on March 31 were 262.8 million. And there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2017 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 268 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance, and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth. At March 31, 2017, cash and short term investments decreased to $633 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.3 billion. Total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis for the consolidated AON including continuing and discontinued operations was 2.7 times. As discussed previously, while debt to EBITDA will be initially elevated as a result of the sale of the Outsourcing business, we expect it to return back to the 2 times to 2.5 times range by the end of 2018, driven by operational improvements. Cash flow from operations for the first three months increased 26% or $38 million to $182 million, primarily driven by strong operational improvement in continuing operations, partially offset by $31 million of cash restructuring charges. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 38% or $41 million to a $148 million, driven by strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $3 million decrease in CapEx. I would note, this is an exceptional start to the year in our historically seasonally weakest quarter, reflecting continued momentum in cash flow as we focus on converting each dollar of revenue into the highest free cash flow yield. Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the long term. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. We've made substantial progress since introducing free cash flow as a key financial metric in 2012, reaching record free cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2016. Our disciplined capital management approach is focused on maximizing return on invested capital, which we've consistently improved each year since 2010, increasing 540 basis points to 17.1% in 2016. The recent sale of our Outsourcing businesses is expected to improve this even further. We've taken significant steps to maximize the translation of each dollar of revenue into the highest amount of free cash flow, including working capital initiatives and actions to manage our cash pension contributions. Since 2010, we've increased our free cash flow margin by nearly 1,000 basis points to 18.1% in 2016. Looking forward, there are three primary areas that we expect to continue to contribute to incremental free cash flow generation. The first is continued operational improvement, driven by accelerated organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We expect working capital to contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long term. And third is the lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate over time. Combined with our increasing free cash flow margin, we believe we are positioned to continued double digit free cash flow growth over the long term. In summary, we delivered positive performance across each of our four key metrics for a strong start to the year. We saw accelerated organic revenue growth, driven by our investments in high growth areas and improved operational performance as we increase operating leverage across one operating model. Operational performance combined with significant financial flexibility from transaction proceeds and underlying free cash flow generation position the firm to deliver on our near term goal of exceeding $7.97 adjusted earnings per share in 2018. Most importantly, this reinforces our ability to deliver double digit free cash flow growth over the long term. We believe we are creating the next significant value creation opportunity for shareholders. With that I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Sure. Good morning. Thanks for the questions.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Hey, Dave.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: First is just a quick easy one, I just want to confirm that the $400 million of savings includes the $91 million of stranded costs you guys have talked about before?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes, it does.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then just can you talk a little bit more about the key buckets of that $400 million that your scoring, what those fall into? If it's people, real estate, IT? I'm assuming maybe it's along those lines. But can you talk about how you score those, your confidence? And then on one hand, it's call it maybe 20% or 25% of your SG&A excluding comp and benefit. And then on the other hand – which seems sort of high. And then on the other hand, you guys have a knack for doing better than your SG&A targets that you've put out there in the past on different programs. So I was just trying to reconcile how confident and how far you scored each one of the key buckets?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Sure. So, Dave, as we think about this program, it's really about bringing together Aon under one operating model. So as we think about the big buckets, they're exactly as you said. It's IT, it's real estate, and it's people. And if you look at the total $400 million in expense takeout, it's 5% of total expenses. So it really isn't a significant sort of transformational activity. It's really increasing operating leverage across the platform. We have enormous confidence in our ability to hit the $400 million. As you accurately pointed out, historically our performance, we've overachieved on these programs. So we feel very good about the $400 million in savings.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then obviously the new segmentation you've got, you've got five businesses, a couple are more granular than we've seen before. Can you guys give us maybe just a high level view of how you think about sustainable organic growth across each one of those?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: So, Dave, from our standpoint we'd like you to think about these as five really revenue lines in terms of where we are. We really have one segment, that's really what we're trying to do. One overall P&L. And the opportunity here is it really reinforces what we know we're best at. When we bring global capability, all of Aon to our clients in a local way, we do exceptionally well. And in essence we're reinforcing that. So not only are we taking actions to improve the operating model of the firm, as Christa described, but we're also taking actions that continue to align the firm. So that's what we're trying to do with the revenue lines. And what you see is a reflection of exactly how we think about the business. So you're seeing opportunities – think about commercial risk, reinsurance, retirement, all the efforts around that. What we do in health. And then now Data & Analytic services, which really represents what we do in Data & Analytic services, in which we sell directly to a client – or actually provide directly to a client, not embedded in the work we do. So for us this is the exact reflection of how we think about growing and building the business. Which is why we're excited to actually take this forward on your behalf, because this again is how we think about it internally.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then a final one, just on that point with it being sort of one global P&L, how do you balance that versus pushing down accountability for the business heads to, not just drive top line, but also hold them accountable for achieving certain margins. Do they still have their own P&Ls that they're accountable for that report up? Or what does that look like in the new structure now?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Yeah, this is – from the standpoint of accountability there's sustained or even more intensified accountability in terms of sort of what has to happen at the grassroots level to build bottom up, to deliver on behalf of the firm. What you see now though is it comes all together in one P&L, to think about kind of integrated Aon. So this is how I think about the business when we think about – and how Christa thinks about the business, when we think about where and how to place capital. So the accountabilities at the front line remain the same and again are intensified. And the opportunity for us is really to take some very substantial steps forward on where we're going to invest and shape the portfolio. And that's what you're looking at here. You're getting a chance to sort of see the five platforms that are really growth platforms. And again if you step back and think about it from a growth standpoint, we started the year, first quarter 4% growth, strongest we've had since 2012. And we've been thinking about it this way for the last 24 months to 36 months. And now you're just seeing a reflection of that. So this is not any type of a change in sort of the detailed front line. It really is how I think and Christa thinks about allocating capital and growing the business overall.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks. I'll step back for others.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Ma'am, your line is open.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good morning and congrats on a good quarter.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Thanks, Sarah.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: My first question is just on the expense savings again. Could you just explain to us in layman's terms with maybe some examples of why the sale of the benefits administration business leads to savings for the remaining business? I'm just trying to understand it a little better.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yeah. So I think the simple way to think about this, Sarah, is we used to have two different sets of infrastructure in IT or the operating support areas for Risk Solutions and HR Solutions. And we're really bringing those support areas together in one Aon business. And so it allows us to make substantial changes in IT around data centers. The outsourcing business had a number of clients who were in the defense area as an example. And really it didn't allow us to utilize public cloud infrastructure as much as we can today. In the real estate area for example, we now – we've moved from 72,000 colleagues to 50,000 colleagues. And our 50,000 colleagues are primarily client facing colleagues, who are actually not sitting in the office 9 to 5 in a call center for example, in the Outsourcing business, but actually need to collaborate a lot more to get their work done. And so it allows us to actually optimize the real estate portfolio in a way that we weren't able to previously.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And that IT and infrastructure that was for the ben and admin business, that doesn't go with Blackstone?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: It does, Sarah. But what it allows us to do is actually pull together the infrastructure that supported HR Solutions with the infrastructure that supported Risk Solutions into one Aon model, which allows us to actually design it for Aon today, which is actually much more like a professional services firm and much less diversified. Because we have the primarily colleagues who are client facing and earning revenue through percent commission on premium placed or fees. And so you've got a much more homogenous environment to design a consistent operating model, if that makes sense.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Yeah. That does. Thank you. And then just on the proceeds from the sale. Could you give us any more thoughts in terms of how you're thinking about deploying that $2 billion for buyback versus reinvestments? And just to clarify, the incremental buybacks from using the proceeds, is that on top of your normal pace of buybacks, which has historically run around $1.5 billion per year?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So first of all I would say, we do have substantial amounts of cash over the coming years. You look at the $3 billion of after-tax proceeds from the sale, you look at $2 billion approximately per year in free cash flow. So you've got approximately $9 billion to invest back into reinvesting in Aon or returning to shareholders. As we think about the balance of that, Sarah, it's really on the same basis we've done it historically, which is return on capital. And we would note that the highest return on capital across Aon remains share repurchase, which is why we increased the share repurchase authorization by $5 billion last quarter. And the other thing I would say though is, we have a robust M&A pipeline with some really attractive opportunities. And so we are fortunate to have great options to both reinvest back into Aon and to return the money to shareholders.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you for the answers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning. Following on the restructuring cost, the $900 million cash is higher than your typical – like your past restructuring program, about 1.25 times of the expected savings. And what's the reason for that? And how much of $400 million will be flow through to the bottom line? And will this restructuring program impact your organic growth in the near term?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Okay. So I'll do the first couple of questions. Then I think Greg will handle the growth question. So on the first question, the 2.25 times. So we're spending $900 million. We're getting $400 million of savings every year. We do think about this, Kai, on a return on capital basis, unsurprisingly, cash on cash returns. And we feel really good about the returns on this business. As we look at the returns, they – we are actually – it's 2.25 times, as you said versus the 1.25 times we've done historically. It's really because we are making structural changes to Aon around IT, around real estate, around some pretty significant investments to actually generate one operating model across Aon. It's going to result in a much more efficient operating model for Aon with much greater operating leverage. And enable much greater growth through greater insights for clients. And so we feel really good about the return on this investment. Your second question about sort of how much of the savings drop to the bottom line, obviously there is a potential for us to reinvest some of it. And we'll think about that on a return on capital basis. And we're not sure at this point whether we will or won't reinvest, but there's obviously the potential for that. And then in terms of the growth and will restructure and savings impact growth, Greg?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: So, Kai, did we answer your first set of questions around sort of the reinvestment piece before we get to growth?
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Okay. Excellent. Listen, on the growth side this is really important just from an overall perspective. Because hopefully you can tell from our tone this morning, we're very enthusiastic about this next set of steps for Aon. This is something we thought about for quite some time. And now we're able to put it into place. Kai, if you think about it the – and this is about accelerating growth. Everything around this is accelerating growth and more impact for clients. The actions we're taking really reflect from our standpoint a real conviction around this opportunity we see before us. And as Christa described, a lot of confidence in our ability to capture it. And remember we – same strategy. Same strategy for the last decade, preeminent professional services firm, focus on risk, retirement, health, underpinned by Data & Analytics. That strategy has served us exceptionally well. As I described in some of my comments and Christa did as well, great NPS, value creation 16%, total return to shareholders for 10 years, great 2016 momentum as we jump into 2017. But we would say, and this what's so important. As we think about the potential of our firm, we're still, Kai, at kind of a four out of 10 in terms of capturing the full opportunity. This is very much kind of the glass half full in terms sort of where we can go. And what we're excited about is we know how to get there. We know this is around meeting client needs more effectively and they're evolving. And then improving Aon. And this is what the restructuring is all about from an Aon standpoint. To get from a 4% to a 7% to an 8% in terms of on a scale of zero to 10, this really involves investing and growing in areas of greatest client need. And you're going to see us do that more and more and more, increase risk of innovation. And then on the Aon piece, it's really aligning Aon more effectively to consistently deliver on this idea of global capability delivered locally. And this is – we call it Aon United. But this is really around becoming a better and better and better professional services firm. And to do that there is a whole series of things around technology, colleague experience, fundamental operations of the firm, as Christa described, we've got to improve on. But we also know the economics and the impact of this as we get this right over the coming 24 months, 36 months has a disproportionate and very strong impact on clients and our colleagues and for our shareholders. And then you get to the Outsourcing piece, why is this a catalyst? As we nurtured this and developed this and created the opportunity, the Outsourcing sale is such a great catalyst, because when you think about what happens when we're done with the moves on the restructuring, we end up with a stronger financial platform in terms of being enable to generate operating income. Because the $900 million investment via the charge and resulting efficiency gain, so it more than just replaces lost income. It really creates operational leverage for us in a very positive way. So you now end up with a platform that has a stronger financial engine. And by definition when you look at the math, is growing faster top line, higher margin, 100 basis points, free cash flow, faster growth, better operating leverage as we add and subtract businesses from the portfolio over time. And then, oh yeah, one other real positive, we generate $3 billion of net proceeds. We invest $900 million back in the business. We've gotten more than $2 billion again to accelerate and invest back into Aon. So for us, Kai, I just – it's important you understand sort of the psychology that went into this. This is something that's been sort of in the works for a long, long time that we're now able to launch with a lot of velocity. And we feel really good about it, which is why Christa described it as kind of in our view the next wave. The next wave for our clients, but equally the next wave for our shareholders. So I know it was a bit long winded, but it hopefully gives you a sense on – so what we're trying to do.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Will that in the near term – much appreciate the answers. Will that impact the near term organic growth, given there's restriction programs going on?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Well, if you see again – if you look at the first quarter and some were already underway, we had record first quarter growth, the highest growth we've had at the company overall since 2012. So our view is this is an accelerant. And that's what it's designed to be. It's really – this is a set of very kind of offensive steps to sort of strengthen our client serving capability and accelerate growth.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Just quick number question on free cash flow and – because that's been a focus for shareholders as well as you guys. Just what's your baseline for 2017? My maths run like if your regional guidance, $2.4 billion, if you take out $500 million from this sales divesture and you take out the $400 million recharging cost, but adding back $150 million of the savings. You get close to $1.7 billion. Is that right way to think about it?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Here's what I'd say, Kai. We're obviously not going to give guidance for the free cash flow of 2017. What we can say is that the right starting point for 2016 is to start with the $2.1 billion we actually delivered in 2016 and take out $400 million for the lost operating income from Tempo and other cash charges.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Well, thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Thank you. Good morning. My first question. The tax rate was 17.5% ex the stock comp benefit in the quarter. Is – was there anything that impacted that? Just because I know you put the Outsourcing earnings in discontinued ops, but the sale did close after the end of the quarter. Or is that how we should think about the tax rate going forward? I guess when you think about this deal being accretive to 2018, the prior consensus number, did that assume a tax rate around 17.5%?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So what I would say is that the adjusted effective tax rate for continuing operations, not including the disposition, was 11.1% for Q1. And our rate of 11.1% in the first quarter primarily reflects the $29 million benefit from a required change in accounting for share based compensation. Excluding that change in accounting, the rate for continuing operations would have been 17.5%. And we are not giving guidance going forward.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then in terms of you guys used to have with the prior two segments, there were margins goals associated with both those segments. Are you going away from having a consolidated margin target? And then following up on Kai's question from earlier in terms of how much of these – the savings plan outlined today will fall to the bottom line. As you think about reaching the 2018 earnings target. Is there some type of assumption that you guys assume in terms of savings that will fall to the bottom line? And is there a way – I mean with your prior programs, can you give us historically how much of the savings on some of those past plans have actually fallen to the bottom line?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So as we think about the business, we make decisions based on return on capital and free cash flow margin. We continue to focus on our four key metrics that we report every year and commit to grow every year, organic revenue growth, operating income, EPS, and free cash flow. And we have two targets going forward, double digit free cash flow growth over the long term and then given all the complexity going on, we have an EPS target of greater than $7.97 in 2018.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And so no more margin target?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: No.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then one other question. Is there a way – it seems to me when I look at the new five lines that your retail brokerage business went into Commercial Risk, into Data & Analytics, and Health Solutions. I just want to understand if that's correct? And then second, Greg, in your prepared remarks you mentioned some timing in terms of the Commercial Risk business I think negatively impacting the Q1 organic. How do you think about organic? Is that something that's shifting over into the second quarter when we think about the organic outlook for that business from here?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Yeah. All of us really trying to – I'll just say it in sort of in that. There is always timing around the quarters, Elyse, and there was in this quarter as well. But coming back to the revenue lines, really important. Again this is how we think about sort of the platforms or investment of the platforms for growth overall. If you think about growth, we've encouraged you to look at Aon. And so that's what we're going to look at. Again back to Christa's four metrics, I would note as well, margin is included in that too. And we have a commitment to continue to improve that. So while no target, we have a commitment to improve on all four of the metrics over the course of the year. And in the case of the revenue lines, we've got five revenue lines that for us represent in many respects how we think about growing the business. On the Commercial Risk side, listen, we feel this has gotten off to a very solid start, very much in line with our expectations. Again we're never caught up in kind of the quarter versus the year. But the underlying activity was exceptionally good. New business, $270 million, up 17%. Retention and rollover were up – both up marginally above 94%, very, very good. Marketing impact was flat. And strong performance internationally with some timing in LatAm. So for us we feel very good about the quarter. You're absolutely right in terms of sort of comparing it to previous quarters, our Data & Analytic Services piece would have been in Risk Solutions. And parts of our Health piece would have been in Risk Solutions too. So for us, we feel very good about the growth for the quarter. Again it's record growth for Aon, back to 2012. So feel very good about that and certainly feel good about where we are on the Commercial Risk side.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And one last question. You mentioned a strong pipeline in terms of potential M&A deals. Is that – would you say that's in relation to deals both in the U.S. and internationally?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Hi. Good morning. With the change in segmentation and the view of the company as sort of one P&L, how does that change the incentives? Not necessarily at the very senior level, but the next tier down, the folks that run those segments. How are their targets thought of if you don't really have a segment level P&L?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: So again, Paul, we would encourage you not to think about these as five segments. They're not in fact five segments. These are five revenue lines, where Christa and I and the most senior team think about capital allocation and disproportionate investments to change and modify the structure of the firm. Sort of our front line continues as it always has continued, thinking about sort of how we serve clients day to day, supporting each other around where we are. So that – don't look for a lot of change there. This is not in any way, shape, or form a restructuring. This is really how we think about the business overall. And we're trying to give you a much clearer window into how we think about capital allocation. We will continue to align the most senior team around a set of incentives. And we've done that for our executive committee, where literally everything is aligned around – together around shareholder value creation. And then we've also got our top 150, top 175 colleagues, who also are now more aligned around this single P&L, which is a very substantial change for us at the most senior level. As well as individual results that they have responsibility for. So for us, we're creating alignment around the one P&L at the top. But at the front line it is exactly as we've been doing. So this isn't a lot of disruption at the front line. This is really meant to create disproportionate investment around growth and to drive growth and to strengthen the firm.
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Next we have Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, thank you. One request and then a couple questions. On the request side, in the future if you're doing a change in reporting format, we'd love a couple weeks of a heads up to get the models going. Not a big deal, but one request. Two questions, I think relatively short. First, the modest benefit you got from the hedging – actually the $12 million I think it was, was there an offset somewhere else in the P&L?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: No. There was no offset. And, Jay, just to your request, we do recognize that there are a lot of moving parts at the moment. And you can imagine with us having to close the transaction, there was an enormous amount of work going on here too. And we've tried really hard to provide a lot of transparency to the numbers. And I think page 17 of the press release really goes through our financials over the last couple of years on an Aon go-forward basis to help set up your model. And the Excel is actually on our website. So hopefully that will help. And we're here to answer any questions for you.
Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That was helpful. And I'm sure I have no appreciation for all that went into it, so thank you. The other question was on the Health side, you talked about some off-cycle I guess renewals on the healthcare exchange business. As we think about the quarter's growth, as we look at next year's first quarter, is that going to represent a tough comp? Is there something a little bit extra that we shouldn't expect to continue in that revenue line?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Well, Jay, consistent with what we just said before, sort of the quarters do what they do. We obviously love this segment, love this business, and have continued to invest in it, continue to see it grow. You're right. There's no doubt it's a hard comp if you want to go quarter to quarter for next year. No doubt about that. But feel very, very good about the overall trajectory. And the off-cycle is literally – on the exchange side as you add companies, make their decisions to add companies, subtract companies, it really changes sort of the off-cycle a bit, another positive thing about this business. And that's what you see reflected here.
Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks, Greg.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Next we have Brian Meredith of UBS. Your line is open.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Yes. Thanks. Two quick ones here. First one, just curious to follow up on Jay's question. Did the healthcare exchange numbers, the seasonality we've historically seen in that, is that no longer going forward? Or are we still going to see a better revenue growth typically in the fourth quarter?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Yeah, you're still going to see it more, Brian – Q4 is skewed just as how companies make decisions. As we described before, we've really worked with clients to think about health really over the course of the year, which they do anyway, but in terms of the mechanics or the decision making process, so you're seeing that spread out a bit. But it's still disproportionately skewed to Q4.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: But not so from a margin perspective? Because obviously you don't have the big expense outlay, right, in the first, second, and third quarter?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Correct.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Got you. Terrific. And then second question, Greg, I'm just curious, with the new structure you've got in place, do you expect this to drive more cross sell between the health benefits consulting businesses and the commercial insurance brokerage business?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Brian, I love that question. Here's – we don't think about it as cross sell. I'll tell you what we think about it as, delivering the firm. So this isn't about sort of a micro, I brought a new product, can you buy this or buy that? This is around an ethic. And we take this deadly seriously. This is an ethic around delivering the global capability of Aon, sitting at the table with clients, thinking about their needs, and having enough understanding as an individual and credibility to introduce parts of Aon to help a client succeed. Sometimes, Brian, that'll result in a sale. Sometimes it's not. What it always does – and we know this. What it always does is it strengthens the reputation of Aon in the eyes of a client. That creates greater degrees of freedom or opportunities for us to actually help that client succeed. And also it gives us more information on where and how to invest in areas that are important to clients. So for us, this is why we're so excited about this opportunity. This is – as we take Aon United and we continue to evolve it and we go from a 4 to a 5 to a 6 to a 7 on that scale of 10 I described before, we know that's going to produce great results for clients and tremendous results for Aon. And in doing so obviously great results for shareholders. So for us it's not cross sell. It's really around Aon United and delivering the firm. And with real credibility in a way we've done many times before, Brian, but we've never done fully consistently. That's why again this isn't about a new concept. This is taking a concept we know works and then scaling it, which is why the investment back into the firm is so important.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Is it trading? Or are you changing the organizational structure within the company as well? More integration of somebody basically looking at one client and looking at everything and then looking down below? How is that working?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: The really – Brian, there's – this is the beauty of this is, this isn't about restructuring or reorganization. There's not reorganization in this. This is literally stepping back and saying, what do we need to do to serve clients more effectively? And how do we work together to do that? In the one P&L, the five revenue lines, the alignment at the senior team, the restructuring that Christa described, all these things are around literally the mindset focus on clients overall. So the beauty of this is, there's not a lot of organizational complexity embedded in this at all. This is really how we come together to support our clients. And again it's not something that's conceptual. We've been thinking about this now for the better part of 24 months. We know this has tremendous potential. It was just how we were going to scale it. So for us this is not about sort of front line organizational change. It's really about how we think about clients.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next we have Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just had a couple I guess more technical ones that should be pretty quick. But the other associated cost bucket in terms of the saves, I think it was close to $200 million. Just a little more detail on what's in that please? Thanks.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Sure. So in there are things like corporate costs, data centers, marketing, there's professional services, there's an array of things in there.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And I guess along those lines, the $200 million of the CapEx that didn't have – I guess in the disclosures wasn't really bucketed. Should we think about that as being allocated pretty similarly as to the reduction in expenses?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Well, the CapEx overall, Ryan, as you know, what we showed before, the $200 million has actually come down over time as we exited our – exited the Tempo businesses. As you recall that was 36% of that CapEx, so that's come down over time.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yeah. And so, Ryan, if you think about CapEx, we had $222 million of CapEx last year. We lost $80 million of CapEx with the divestiture of the – our Outsourcing business. So that gets you to $122 million as the right starting point. And then – sorry, $142 million as the right starting point. And then you add on the CapEx of $30 million from the restructuring program, so you get to $172 million. And CapEx is mostly for Aon, IT, and real estate.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. Okay. And then just the follow-up was on the change in the hedge program. I just – I was just curious if that has a predictable impact on the P&L over the rest of the year relative to 2016? Or was that just random? Or was that just related to 1Q? Thanks.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So, Ryan, the Indian hedging program has now ceased, because it was really primarily put in place, because we had a significant asset in India related to our Outsourcing business. And so now that we've dispositioned that Outsourcing business, you will not see this again. Ryan, any other questions?
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: No, I didn't have any. Thanks.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn it back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Well, thanks very much for joining us. We look forward to the next call. And everybody, have a great day. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect your line at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc. Sir, you may begin.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment and this morning's important subsequent announcement of a definitive agreement to sell certain outsourcing assets. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics, each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically; expand margins; increase earnings per share; and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to slide 3, in the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, with growth across both segments, highlighted by strong double-digit growth in our healthcare exchange business. Operating margin increased 210 basis points, reflecting significant operational improvement in both segments. EPS increased 13% to $2.56, primarily reflecting strong operating performance, effective capital management, and a lower effective tax rate. If we turn to the full year, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, including growth across every major business. Operating margin increased 80 basis points, driven by strong operating performance and record margin results in Risk Solutions and HR Solutions. EPS increased 7% to $6.59. And finally, free cash flow increased 22% to a record $2.1 billion. Overall, we delivered positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the quarter and the full year. Substantial investments in high-growth areas, improved operational performance, and record free cash flow generation continue to position the firm for increased shareholder value creation over the long term. Turning to slide 4, on the second topic of growth in investment, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives to maximize return on invested capital and making strategic investments to strengthen underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage. We continue to drive improvement in client leadership, with management of our renewal book portfolio through a proactive client partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across retail brokerage, including: record retention rates in the U.S. and EMEA; new business generation of more than $360 million in the fourth quarter across retail brokerage, including double-digit growth in EMEA and the Pacific regions as well as another consecutive quarter of record new business in U.S. retail; and 23 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance. In addition, we're increasing operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon Inpoint, a growing business where we help carriers become more competitive and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the Risk Insight Platform, which now captures 3.4 million trades and nearly $170 billion of bound premium, as well as our reinsurer dashboard, ReView. Another example is our Aon broking initiative to better match client need with insurer risk appetite, including our ability to identify structured portfolio solutions. And finally, we're investing significantly in high-growth businesses, including cyber, health and benefits, and in Affinity. Most recently in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Admix, a leading health and benefits brokerage and solutions firm in Brazil, enabling Aon to expand its capabilities throughout Latin America. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of Stroz Friedberg, a global leader in cyber security and cyber remediation as well earlier in the year. Finally, another important example is Univers, a leading elective benefits enrollment services firm in our health and benefits brokerage business. Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 3% against a strong comparable of 6% in the prior-year quarter. Exposures continue to be modestly positive across the region while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in a modestly negative market impact overall. We saw strong growth in Affinity, with continued strength in the Consumer Solutions group. Results also reflect strong growth in Latin America, driven by effective capital management of the renewal book portfolio as well as continued record new business generation in U.S. retail. In international, organic revenue growth was 2% against a strong comparable of 6% in the prior-year quarter. The impact from pricing remains modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Asia and Europe, while exposures are modestly improving, resulting in a relatively flat market impact overall. We saw growth across every major region, including the Pacific, Asia, and EMEA. Results were highlighted by double-digit growth in the health and benefits brokerage business across both Asia and EMEA regions. We also saw overall strength across the Pacific in both New Zealand and Australia, driven by strong new business generation. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 2%, similar to the prior-year quarter. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance. For the full year, the Reinsurance business delivered organic revenue growth of 1%, reflecting a return to growth in 2016, as anticipated. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by continued net new business generation in treaty and growth in facultative placements as well as growth in new products such as ReView. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact globally and a modest decline in capital markets transactions. Overall, market conditions remained similar to prior discussions. Price declines continue to moderate and ceding demand continues to increase against record levels of capital. Against that backdrop, Aon's leading data and analytics have been instrumental in driving innovative capital solutions across new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk, and other emerging risks such as cyber liability. Overall across Risk Solutions, our strategic investments in high-growth areas and in data and analytics continue to drive new business generation, strong retention rates, and increased returns across the portfolio, positioning the Risk Solutions segment for continued long-term growth. Before turning to HR Solutions, I'd like to wish my colleague and friend Steve McGill, our former Group President and Chairman of HR Solutions, well in the next chapter of his career. Steve has spent nearly 40 years in the industry and has been a valued leader at Aon. Going forward, our Global Risk Solutions business will be led by two exceptional colleagues, Michael O'Connor as CEO of Aon Risk Solutions and Eric Andersen as the CEO of Aon Benfield. Now turning to HR Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5% overall, driven by solid growth across high-demand areas where we continue to invest in innovative solutions and client serving capabilities. These investments reflect Aon's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends, including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A double-digit area of growth has been delegated investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to $90 billion in five years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets; in addition, continued investments to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size, and funding choices, including our suite of private healthcare exchanges. We saw strong double-digit growth across our exchange solutions, including increased enrollments across both our active and retiree platforms and significantly improved profitability for the full year. And finally, we're investing in data analytics across our health and retirement investment practices to provide superior advice and drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees. Reflecting on the individual businesses within HR Solutions, in Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 8% compared to 4% in the prior-year quarter. Results reflect strong double-digit growth in our healthcare exchange business, driven by an increase in enrollments across the platform as well as certain project-related work. We also saw continued growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was flat. We saw continued strong growth in global retirement consulting, specifically for delegated investments in Consulting Services, reflecting an increasing demand for Aon's tailored solutions and independent advice. We also saw growth in Communications Consulting from continued momentum of employers communicating to employees on financial and health wellness. Results in the quarter were offset by a decline in project-related work than the prior-year quarter as well as a modest decline in our talent and compensation consulting business. In summary of our performance, we end 2016 in a position of strength. We delivered growth across both segments, invested heavily in high-growth areas like cyber risk, advisory, and health and benefits, achieved record operating margins across the firm, and generated a record $2.1 billion of free cash flow for the year. Now I'd like to turn to slide 6 of the presentation to discuss another exciting step in our journey. This morning we announced a definitive agreement to sell our benefits administration and HR Business Process Outsourcing assets. We believe this transaction reflects a continuation of our proven strategy and creates a catalyst for the next step of significant shareholder value creation. For over a decade, we've been on a mission to strengthen our firm: a mission of increased focus on providing advice and solutions; a mission enabled by proprietary data and analytics; a mission to be the preeminent professional services firm in the world focused on risk, retirement, and health. We've taken strategic actions from virtually every angle to achieve this mission, beginning with the dispositions of lower-margin capital-intensive insurance underwriting businesses and risk, reallocating capital from balance sheets to high-value solutions, strengthening our capabilities to serve global clients locally, and investing to build a set of unmatched data and analytics, including $85 billion of annual risk premiums supported by our Inpoint and ReView technology, $30 billion for the annual premium in health with a full set of health solutions, $4 trillion of pension assets under independent advisory with $90 billion under delegation. We believe in our mission and the progress has been positive, with 6% annual revenue growth and 16% annual growth in total shareholder returns over the last 10 years, but we are not standing still. The decision to sell these outsourcing assets is another exciting step against our mission, creating a win-win situation for our clients and for Aon: for our outsourcing clients, a partner in Blackstone, who will set the global standard for operations excellence and technology innovation in this area, and for Aon, another step to sharpen our focus on advice and solutions. We're reallocating resources from capital-intensive outsourcing assets to accelerating investment in high-growth high-margin areas across retirement and health, including such areas as delegated investment consulting, health and benefits brokerage, and private healthcare exchanges. Overall, we're excited about the step and what it means for Aon, for our clients, and for our shareholders as the next step of significant shareholder value creation. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa now for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. As Greg noted, this transaction further strengthens the firm's advisory capability and accelerates innovation through effective allocation of capital to maximize client and shareholder value. The pending sale of the benefits administration and HR BPO assets is expected to generate gross cash proceeds up to $4.8 billion, including $4.3 billion of cash consideration at closing and an additional consideration up to $500 million based on performance. Total after-tax cash proceeds are expected to be $3 billion. This reflects a multiple of approximately 12.1 times 2016 EBITDA of $396 million, which includes intercompany corporate allocations and other expense adjustments. We believe this transaction reflects a continuation of a proven strategy and is further evidence of our disciplined capital management approach to drive improved return on capital, which has increased each year since 2010, up 540 basis points to 17.1% in 2016. Driven by effective capital deployment of free cash flow and transaction proceeds, savings from operating model integration, and a lower effective tax rate, we expect the transaction to be accretive to 2018 FactSet consensus analyst estimates of $7.97 per share. Further, we also announced that part of the proceeds from this transaction will be allocated to an increase in our previously authorized share repurchase program. The repurchase program will increase by $5 billion, bringing the total amount currently authorized for repurchase to approximately $7.7 billion as of February 10, 2017. Lastly, we expect the transaction to close by the end of the second quarter 2017, with the results of the assets being placed into discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2017. For modeling, the impact of divested operating income and stranded costs going forward, we would eliminate $323 million of adjusted operating income while adding $91 million of corporate allocations and other expense adjustments. These two adjustments we estimate would reduce your future expectations by $414 million on an annual basis before any other adjustments for timing of close and potential actions we may take to improve operational performance. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter and year on page 8 of the presentation. Our results in the quarter reflect growth, operational improvement in both segments, strong double-digit free cash flow growth to a record $2.1 billion for the year, and effective capital management. Further, we deployed roughly $2.5 billion of capital in 2016 through share repurchase, attractive acquisitions in high-growth businesses, and dividends. Our core EPS performance excluding certain items increased 13% to $2.56 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $2.27 in the prior-year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 13 in the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization and non-cash expenses related to certain pension settlements, as well as transaction costs related to the sale of the outsourcing assets. Also included in the results was a $0.03 per share favorable impact related to foreign currency translation, due primarily to U.S. dollar strength against the pound. For the full year, foreign currency translation had a $0.01 unfavorable impact on EPS. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have a modest unfavorable impact in the first quarter of 2017. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating income increased 9%, and operating margin increased 190 basis points to 27.6% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 190 basis points reflects solid organic revenue growth across every major business and 100 basis points of favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by $6 million or minus 30 basis points of transaction-related costs for acquisitions previously mentioned. For the full year, operating income increased 5% and operating margin improved 90 basis points to a record 24.5%, driven by return on our investments across the portfolio and a 60 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 5%. Operating income increased 7%, and operating margin increased 210 basis points to 28.3% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating performance in the fourth quarter primarily reflects strong growth in our high-demand investment areas and expense discipline as we take steps to reduce certain costs related to previous dispositions. Results were modestly offset by an $8 million or minus 10 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. For the full year, operating income on a reported basis decreased 1% and operating margin increased 30 basis points to a record 18.4%. Driven by specific decisions to dispose of certain businesses at the beginning of 2016, we believe it's helpful to look at the underlying operational improvement of the platform. Adjusting for the impact of approximately $29 million of lost operating income and stranded costs related to previous dispositions and $20 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, underlying operating income would have increased 5%, with operating margins increasing 120 basis points to 19.6% for the full year. Now let me discuss the few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses decreased $4 million to $57 million. Interest income was $3 million compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense increased to $2 million to $70 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $9 million primarily includes gains due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurements of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. The prior-year quarter primarily included a gain on the sale of our Asset Management business and Outsourcing in HR Solutions. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income, and $70 million per quarter of interest expense. Turning to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with non-cash pension settlements, decreased to 14.9% compared to 17.9% in the prior-year quarter. Changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments impacted the adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter and for the full year against our underlying operating tax rate of approximately 19%. The prior-year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation. As discussed on prior calls, discrete tax adjustments can be favorable or unfavorable in any given period. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 4% to 268.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to 279.3 million in the prior-year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased 1.8 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. Actual shares outstanding on December 31 were 262 million, and there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 2017 beginning diluted share count is approximately 267 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance, and share repurchase. As mentioned previously, the company announced an increase in its previously authorized share repurchase program this morning. The repurchase program will increase by $5 billion, bringing the total amount currently authorized for repurchase to approximately $7.7 billion as of February 10, 2017. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth. At December 31, 2016, cash and short-term investments decreased to $721 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.2 billion. Total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.5 times. While debt to EBITDA will be initially elevated as a result of this transaction, we expect to return back to the 2.5 area in 2018. Cash flow from operations for the full year increased 16% or $317 million to a record $2.3 billion, primarily driven by an increase in underlying net income after adjusting for certain non-cash pension expenses, lower cash pension contributions, and lower cash taxes. We also saw underlying working capital improvement, reflected by a 2-day decrease in days sales outstanding over the trailing 12-month period. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 22% or $385 million to a record $2.1 billion, driven by strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $68 million decrease in CapEx. In 2016, we delivered strong double-digit free cash flow growth, reflecting momentum as we focus on converting each dollar of revenue into the highest free cash flow yield. Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the long term, we value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. We've made substantial progress since introducing free cash flow as a key financial metric in 2012 and continued to take significant steps to position the firm for the double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term. There are three primary areas that we expect to contribute to incremental free cash flow growth going forward. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last five years, and working capital provided a positive inflow as part of our record free cash flow generation in 2016. We expect working capital to contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long term. And third is lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate rates over time. In summary, we delivered positive performance across each of our four key metrics for the quarter and full year. We're heading into 2017 in a position of strength, driven by our substantial investments in high-growth areas, our record free cash flow generation, and continued discipline around capital deployment opportunities. We've increased return on invested capital from 11.7% in 2010 to over 17% in 2016. The transaction announced this morning will further enable the firm to improve return on invested capital, accelerate free cash flow growth, and create the next wave of shareholder value creation. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We now have questions on queue. The first one is coming from the line of Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: I think you might be on mute, Dave.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Here we go. Can you guys hear me now?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: We can.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay, great. Thanks for the questions. I think I'll start with a qualitative question just about the transaction here and understanding maybe the history of when you put these assets together. And I think the rationale back then was cost synergies and diversification and so forth. And then over time as we fast-forwarded, can you just explain a little bit more about the rationale now? As you're divesting these assets, is it more so because it's maybe one of your lower margin business lines and you see better opportunities for the ROIC as you look to deploy some of that cash organically or inorganically internally to some of the other areas that you mentioned? Maybe you could flesh out some of those opportunities that you're looking at. And then I've got a second question on just the accretion that I'll hold for you in a second.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Sure, and that's a great place to start, Dave. For us, we see this as very much a natural progression. And really you go back more than a decade as you think about what we've tried to do, same strategy, same approach, focused on preeminent firm in the world focused on risk, retirement, health, all things around that, talent, capital, the things that come with that, really risk, retirement, and health. You've seen us make substantial investments all along the way, particularly focused around expertise and excellence in advice and solutions. And where we can underpin it by data and analytics, we've doubled down and invested more and more against that. That has served us exceptionally well. And we love that strategy, we continue to double down and invest in that strategy. The addition of Hewitt to the Aon family in 2010 was a great, great catalyst for us that reinforced our efforts around retirement and health among other areas, and we've really incorporated those capabilities and continued to strengthen and build Aon. And all you're seeing today is yet another opportunity to step back and say where is the best place for us to put capital, how can we do it most effectively to reinforce the same strategy, preeminent firm in the world focused on risk, retirement, and health, particularly around advice, solutions, underpinned by data and analytics, and that's exactly what we're able to do today as we announced this divestiture. And what's great about this is we're taking our outsourcing assets, partnering with Blackstone. Our clients are going to be exceptionally well-served with Blackstone and the innovation they can bring to the table. And we are going to then now be able to innovate more and more focused on our core strategy around risk, retirement, and health on the topics of advice, solutions, and data. So for us, this is just a great outcome and represents a continuation of a strategy we've been on for a long time that served us quite well.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: And, Dave, the other thing I would add just to your question on return on capital is it's absolutely driven by our return on capital strategy. This is a lower revenue growth, lower margin business for us. You can see that in the schedule attached to the transaction release, and it will improve the overall return on capital of Aon. We believe Aon post this transaction will be higher revenue growth, higher margin, and a higher return on capital with higher free cash flow growth.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: And as far as the areas, I know you mentioned a couple, the exchanges and then reallocating assets to retirement and so forth. Can you talk a little bit more about those areas that you're most interested in, whether it's organically or inorganically?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: We're going to continue again to make investments all along the topics of retirement, health, risk, et cetera. If you think about maybe just the last year, the investments we've made in Admix, Univers, Cammack, Mayfair, all these are areas that really are health-related acquisitions and brought great capability, the investments we've made in delegated. We love this space. It's gone from $10 billion, as I said before, to $90 billion in delegated, so I love the spaces around retirement. You see us investing a lot in data and analytics as it relates to risk, retirement, and health. So for us, Dave, this again is a continuation of the strategy we've been on for a long time, and this gives us the opportunity to allocate even more capital into these areas and really double down on risk, retirement, and health. This is quite consistent if you go back in time and think about what we did when we divested of our insurance underwriting assets and invested it back into the business. Now we've got yet another opportunity. Christa described and I described a real catalyst for us to increase shareholder return as a result of this.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the numbers, maybe you can give us a little bit more of a quantitative bridge for the operating income loss. I think it's 15%-plus of the total, and how you replace that, whether it's – I think buybacks can only do so much. Maybe you could give us a better idea. Are you thinking about using maybe half of the $3 billion for buybacks or some sort of range there? And then what else is helping to bridge that? I know you've talked about operating expense savings. Is that more so because you're just integrating the businesses a little bit more? And then on the tax savings, is there actual real tax savings, or does the tax rate go lower just because the business mix changes?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Thanks, Dave. So I think in terms of how you think about modeling this, if you took the 2016 operating income number on a GAAP basis, you'd eliminate $323 million of adjusted operating income and then you'd add back $91 million of corporate allocations and other expenses. So therefore, you'd adjust your 2016 numbers by $414 million on an annual basis, and that's really the base from which you then start to model going forward. So I think that's what you're taking out. In terms of guidance going forward, what we have said is we expect to be accretive to 2018 FactSet analyst estimates of $7.97. And the way in which we would get there is continued operating income growth of the business, continued savings as we bring together the operational model of Aon under Aon United, areas like IT and real estate as you think about Aon much more focused on advice and solutions. As outsourcing business being much more capital intensive, it allows us to actually generate savings there on the operating model side. We will have a lower effective tax rate really as a result of the things we continue to say, lower tax rate, rate reductions in different countries around the world, and overall geographic distribution of income. And in terms of use of proceeds, as we think about the business going forward, we really think about continuing to employ proceeds on a return on capital basis in terms of cash-on-cash returns. As you look, and we would expect that we would deploy the proceeds and our free cash flow growth in a mix of M&A and share repurchase, if you look at 2016, we did about $1 billion of M&A. As we think about the pipeline of M&A, we have fantastic return on capital opportunities there, we'd expect that trend to continue. And we also, as you saw, authorized an increase in our share repurchase program of $5 billion, and we now have $7.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. And share repurchase remains our highest return on capital opportunity across Aon. But we do see terrific opportunities through improved operating income growth, M&A, share repurchase, reduced operating model savings, and a lower effective tax rate to get back to accretive in 2018.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, I'll step back for others.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning, thanks.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Hey, Adam.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Also on the transaction, so you're selling the benefits administration platform, the HR BPO, but it sounds like you're still going to be in the benefit brokerage business and the exchange business. Can you tell us how that's going to work?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Adam, it's very much going to work like it works today. I mean, think about it, we're going to – just take the exchanges for an example. Just as it is today, we're going to be involved in architecture and design, all the carrier relationships, the plan details that come together, the actuarial work which underpins that, the risk management which is so important and critical for the back-end risk adjustment of that. And our new partner at Blackstone, is going to be helping and supporting around administration and call centers and enrollment flow and all the things that are important to that. And at the front end, this is a place where as we think about innovation, we're going to continue to invest in data and analytics to really innovate on the front end as we think about the architecture and design. So for us, this is a very, very natural progression. And what we're excited about is we're now going to actually to be bringing to a client innovation on both the front end more intensively through us and on the operations side through Blackstone. So we think this is again, as I described, a real win-win-win and lets us really focus on the areas that we have highest interest in, highest return on invested capital, high margin, high growth, and it gives our clients the opportunity to actually benefit from more innovation across the supply chain.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: So it sounds like you're still going to sell and distribute the product, but Blackstone will really run the technology and call center. Is that sort of how the arrangement works?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Yes, it really is. That's a great way to describe it. And again, I'd think about it, for those who are more focused and familiar with the risk side of the business, it's not dissimilar to us structuring an incredibly complex transactions for a client on the risk side. And then we partner with insurers, who obviously do the underwriting and the claims, some of the claims processing and pieces around that. So we think this is a very natural progression, and we're very excited about it.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. And then as far as the Workday and some of the other ERP implementation service business, is that a similar arrangement? Are you keeping the distribution, or is that business mainly going to Blackstone?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: No, this all goes to Blackstone. And it really, again, we wanted to make sure that platform was a very standalone clear platform to serve clients effectively. We believe we've got that accomplished, and we're going to focus on the advice, solutions part of the overall supply chain for our clients.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: So will you still be selling that Workday implementation, but then Blackstone will be doing the work? Is that again how it works?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: No, it's not. Again, Blackstone owns all the pieces that are around the outsourcing parts of this.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: And the execution parts of this. We're going to be relating to clients on the front end on the overall program and how it would work for them.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then on the free cash flow, obviously you've done a great job. You had previously talked about a target. Does the target reset lower because you've taken a lot of free cash out of the business? How should we think about that going forward?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So obviously, we're very pleased with the $2.1 billion in free cash flow for 2016. It was really driven by operating income growth, improvements in working capital, lower pension cash, and lower cash taxes, so we're very pleased with that outcome. And you can see, we expect free cash flow to continue to grow double digits going forward. And so that will be the expectation, as I said, because Aon exiting this business, Aon post this transaction is really a higher revenue growth, higher margin, higher return on capital business, with higher free cash flow growth.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. But does the base start from a lower basis because you're losing?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes, that's right.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, okay, okay, that makes sense. And then as far as the cost saving element of this, will there be a charge related to it, and will most of those cost savings be attained in 2018, or is this going to be a several-year program?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Like we've always done, Adam, for us this is about building long-term value, so you will see us invest back into the business in all the ways Christa described, but also around creating efficiencies. And so in the coming months and quarters, you're going to see us take up efforts and initiatives to do that. And again, we have an opportunity now to really streamline the business in ways we haven't done before, very much focused on the areas around advice, solutions, and data and analytics.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Quentin McMillan from KBW. Your line is now open.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi, thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to touch on the tax rate. You obviously said that you're going to be able to achieve a lower tax rate by divesting this business. And I'm assuming that's in relation to the current tax environment that we have today. But could you talk about any thoughts that you might have if the U.S. corporate tax rate was to decline? Would that, thoughts basically still hold true? And then just on the bigger picture questions that are out there, do you have any current thoughts about interest deductibility going away or anything else that may come to pass?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Look, Quentin. As we think about the legislative environment we're in, obviously there's a lot of uncertainty right now. We're certainly monitoring it very closely. At this stage, it's too early to tell as there's little guidance and no draft legislation written on how this would impact financial services, insurance, or insurance brokerage. And so we'll let you know as we learn more.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, great. Then just in terms of the health and benefits business as it relates to the healthcare exchange, are you going to be folding the healthcare exchange in there as a tool that will be sold in conjunction with that? And then also obviously putting up double-digit growth in health and benefits in Asia and EMEA was very strong in the quarter. But in the Americas, some other peers of yours had talked about a little bit longer decision-making process from some of their clients related to the ACA and other healthcare decisions that could be changing. Did you see any weakness in the America that could show up in the back half of this year or might have changed the selling cycle there at all?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: We really didn't on that point, Quentin. And we'd step back and say listen, for us it isn't about one specific area, so it's not about an exchange or health and benefits piece, it's about health. As we said before, we love the category. We've got a business, it's a $1.5 billion business that has grown double digits over the last three years with a very, very attractive margin. And we're doubling down and investing in that. Whether it's on the exchange, in H&B, in elective, we love the space and we're going to continue to double down and invest in it. We see a lot of momentum there.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, great, and just one quick one. In terms of the share repurchases, just a little bit below what I would have expected in the fourth quarter. Can you just comment? Was your share repurchase in the fourth quarter impacted by the fact that you had material non-public information from this deal?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes, it was.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Ma'am, your lie is now open.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good morning.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Hi, Sarah.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I'm looking at the Risk Solutions organic growth in the quarter. I thought there was going to be some revenue that was shifting from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, so I thought you would have seen a sequential pickup in organic versus 3Q. Could just talk about what was going on there?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Really for us, we actually feel good about where we finished in the year overall. Sarah, obviously the 6% comp in the prior-year quarter created a little headwind. We don't ever like to use that as an excuse, but the math is the math. But we really feel good about how we finished the quarter and the year. If you look at net new business growth, it's again another record across the firm, with real momentum particularly around what we've done on Aon Client Promise and how that's affected retention rates. So we feel good about it. We would reflect – again, we always want to drive for more growth, and we're working on doing that. But we finished the year at 3% overall and record margin. And so for us, it's pretty good progress.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks, and then just a couple numbers questions on deals today. How much of the proceeds will you be using for share buyback? And how much do you expect your overall tax rate to fall, and how much could the return on invested capital improve?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Sarah, as we think about the starting point, we do believe that the after-tax cash proceeds are expected to be about $3 billion. And as we think about those cash proceeds plus our free cash flow, we have substantial amounts of cash to invest. And we really believe we're going to invest in a mix of M&A and share repurchase. And we're going to allocate that based on return on capital and cash-on-cash returns. And you can see the chart in the release in terms of return on capital how much we've grown, over 540 basis points over the last five years. And so we are divesting a lower revenue growth, lower margin business, and therefore you can expect return on capital to continue to increase. And we haven't given specific guidance around overall mix of allocating the cash because we continue to optimize it on a return-on-capital basis.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thanks, and then just the tax rate?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So as we think about the tax rate going forward, we are not giving future guidance. As we said, we're monitoring the legislative environment very closely, and we'll continue to update you as we learn more.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I just meant with the deal. Could you even just tell us what the tax rate was on the business sold?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: It's certainly a higher-tax business because it's mostly a U.S.-based business. And so as you look at the gross proceeds, you can see the tax rate applicable is very high because it's mostly a U.S.-based business.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, all right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning. So with the divesture, in the past you talked about HR Solutions operating margin target of 22% over the long run. Could this change the target as well as the trajectory towards there?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Kai, for us again, we feel very good about where we are and the momentum we have around risk, retirement, and health, and this will continue to reinforce progress there. So you will see momentum and push against that. And again, we had a record margin as you reflect on the year. So we finished the year at 18.4%, which was again the highest it's ever been, and you're going to see continued progress against that. As Christa described, we literally just divested of a business that was lower growth, lower margin, and lower return on invested capital. So by definition, we're going to get some momentum against that, but that's not as important for us as what we're going to be able to invest now back into the business in the way as Christa described, both in M&A as well as in what we're doing in areas like delegated, like the exchanges, like data and analytics organically, which underpin that. So for us, we believe this is a catalyst for performance, which is what Christa highlighted in her discussion.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then you talk now more about potential acquisition opportunities. I just wonder. In the past, you've in recent years been more focused on buybacks and now acquisition pickup. I just wonder. Is buyback still the best return from your perspective, or will we see probably more active in terms of acquisitions?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So, Kai, buyback, as I said earlier, is still the highest return on capital opportunity across the company, and that's why you saw the increased $5 billion authorization of buyback this morning. And so we have $7.7 billion of buyback authorization remaining. And what we see in the M&A pipeline is some terrific high return on capital opportunities. And we will be generating tremendous free cash flow growth over the coming years and we've got proceeds from the transaction, so we expect to be investing in both.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: If you look back over time, just filling in on what Christa just described, over the last 10 years we've really deployed $18 billion plus just around decisions roughly, which were obviously in dividends, but also the part left over was roughly half in buyback and roughly half in M&A. So for us, it really has been an investment opportunity over time. We have been very, as Christa described, very disciplined about how we've done that. I think Christa – last year we had zero in M&A in 2015, and this year we've got $1 billion in 2016. So if you think about – and now we're going into 2017, so for us this is not about any criteria. This is about straight-up return on investment capital and making sure we're delivering on behalf of our clients in that regard, but also our shareholders. And that's how you'll see us deploy capital going forward, just as we've done in the past.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, last one. On free cash flow per share, will that also be accretive in 2018 similar to the adjusted EPS?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: We haven't given guidance on that. What we've said about free cash flow is we expect free cash flow to grow double digits going forward.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Just to clarify one thing, I'm assuming that the added potential consideration of $500 million, that will not be included in earnings, correct?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: It's going to happen over time, Jay, so it would happen in many years from now. And so we really think about that being based on performance. And so we give you guidance over the coming years as the performance gets delivered.
Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: But you will include it then in your adjusted earnings eventually?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: It's cash. It wouldn't flow through earnings.
Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right, okay, that's what I thought, just double-checking on that. And then given your goal of reducing the leverage, will you have to take some explicit deleveraging actions to deal with your debt at all?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: We do not intend to do that. We do believe that the growth in operating income, the additional operating income that we will add from M&A will be terrific. And as I said, our debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.5 times at year end 2016. And while we'll be slightly elevated post this transaction, we expect to return to 2.5 levels in 2018.
Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That's really helpful. I'm going to sneak one more quick one in. And as we talk about a lower tax rate helping the accretion by 2018, I'm assuming that's simply because you're getting rid of the business that has a higher tax rate. This sale should not impact your tax rate from your other businesses, correct?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: It shouldn't, no.
Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Good morning, maybe some clarifying questions. The $3 billion in cash, does that include the proceeds from the $500 million in the performance bonus related to?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: No, it does not.
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: So that's theoretically a positive prospectively?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: It would theoretically be incremental cash over time. And given it's performance-based, as I mentioned earlier, we would give you an update on the timing and amount of that based on performance in the coming years.
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Was the outsourcing business that you're selling inherently more volatile business from an earnings perspective than the rest of Aon, or was it pretty similar?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: It's fairly similar. The way I would describe it is it was a lower revenue growth, lower margin, more capital intensive business, but it was not more volatile.
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: And then this is a little bit aside. The accounting change that you made related to the revenue rec in the risk business, am I to assume that that seasonality change will persist prospectively?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Absolutely right.
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Okay, that's it for me. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very for taking my questions, two easy ones. Does the $3 billion you're citing, does that include or exclude the potential higher price if you were to meet certain performance objectives?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: It does not include for $500 million earn-out.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent, great. And two, following on Adam's question just a little bit, when I think about healthcare exchanges, I think it's a technology, I think it's a distribution platform. Is Blackstone going to be operating the healthcare exchange and you're going to be doing I guess the healthcare design? How is that relationship going to work on this very growthy business?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: On the exchanges, again, as I described before, we're retaining the exchanges. We're going to work with Blackstone on the exchanges, but we're retaining the exchanges. So we're doing design, broking, actuarial as those are put into place, and Blackstone will be doing administration delivery against that platform. Again, we think this is going to be a very seamless connection. And the beauty of this is we're going to have more innovation on the topic of exchanges than ever before, us on the front end doing what I just described, Blackstone on the operating back end doing what they described. And it allows us to apply data and analytics more effectively to actually create that innovation. And you can expect Blackstone will be doing the same thing on technology innovation from an operations standpoint. And for us, the net is, as Christa described before, we're in a less capital intensive situation in which we're able to focus on advice and solutions consistent with what our overall strategy is.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Let's say hypothetically an employee accesses a portal and the company is giving $150 – $200 to the exchange operator. Is Aon getting those revenues or is Blackstone getting those revenues?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: These are split. Blackstone owns the processing pieces of this, as I described before. And we own the front-end design, broking, actuarial pieces, as I described before.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And so you'll share portal fees?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: We're going to get a commission from that standpoint. And then from the operating side, Blackstone will get the operating revenues from that.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you, good morning or afternoon I guess. I guess, Greg, I was hoping you could just walk us through or at least help me understand relative to the original Hewitt acquisition in 2010. I know in your prepared comments at the beginning, you mentioned that this is a low margin business and low growth and compared it to the previous sale of underwriting. I can understand, but the underwriting business was a legacy business I guess when you came on board and the construct of Aon, as opposed to Hewitt, which was a deal you guys did and the benefits in HR BPO being the lion's share of that business when it was transacted. I guess I was trying to understand. What's transpired over the last six years that's given you a different view of that because on a return on capital basis of that $4.9 billion deal done in 2010, I guess I'm not seeing the return on capital of that transaction then? Or is it just – is the world different? Did the pieces come together differently than expected in hindsight, or just the thought process I would appreciate?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Let me just step back, Charles, because I think you're making some assumptions which actually are not how we saw it at all. In fact, if you step back, we couldn't be actually more excited and pleased with bringing Hewitt into the Aon family. This has always been about building content capability around the topics of risk, retirement, and health. And Hewitt brought such tremendous capability for us on retirement and health. We're sitting today in the strongest position we've ever been in categories we absolutely love. We just delivered record margin against those categories. And now we're in essence in a position where we can continue to grow and reinvest in those areas. So for us, Hewitt was just an incredibly positive catalyzing event for Aon that really reinforced and underpinned our strategy. So we love this. And the outsourcing business from that standpoint was a business that was more capital intensive, was a business that was lower margin, lower return on invested capital, but we continued to invest and build that as well. And now we have an opportunity, as we announced today, to step back and say now that we've achieved that, we can actually now divest that asset and now redeploy back into the areas that we have really been focused on all along. So for us, this is very much a continuation and very much a logical step and a strategy we've had for over a decade, and really reinforce it. And by the way, just as a reference, again if one were doing the math, if you were to go back in 2010 and look at our return on invested capital, and since 2010, our return on invested capital has increased 540 basis points. We feel pretty good about that progress. We can always do better, feel pretty good about that progress, and it's a record now 17.1%. And the day before we announced it to you, I think we're trading at about $38, and last I looked, we were slightly higher than that now. So from a standpoint of how things worked, we feel great about that, not so much from a return standpoint, which by the way, the mechanics were exceptional, just exceptional, but really from a strategic standpoint. And I would urge you not to compare what the acquisition of Hewitt was versus what today is because we didn't keep Hewitt separate. Hewitt was about Aon. It was about strengthening Aon, and it actually accomplished all that frankly and exceeded our expectations.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then I guess – I appreciate that – and I guess a couple of numbers questions. For Christa, I guess thinking of the free cash flow going forward, you guys have put in this presentation the annualized growth, which is very helpful. Is it reasonable since how you calculate the cash flow of operating cash flow less CapEx, but we don't have it split out by business, our starting point of the $2.1 billion for 2016 just being netted down by the adjusted EBITDA number that you provided for the sold business, is $1.6 billion the adjusted starting point for cash flow for 2016? Is that a reasonable way to think about your double-digit starting?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes, I think that, and then there was CapEx of about $80 million. And so as you think about that, you're starting with slightly higher basis and then double-digit cash flow growth from there I think is the right way to think about it.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then finally on taxes, I know you don't giving guidance. But the tax hit on the sale, about 30% I think on the $3 billion cash versus the $4.3 billion sale price, is that going to have a disproportionate effect in 2017 numbers relative to your tax rate going back? Is that going to flow through differently than the business would? I'm just trying to understand on how that's going to affect current year's overall organizational tax for the 2017 period.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: I would separate out the transaction from the operating rate. And I did say again for 2016, the right underlying operating rate for Aon was about 19%, and it has remained that way for several years. And so that's been the operating rate for the last couple of years. The transaction is a one-time item and would not flow through the adjusted EPS and effective tax rate.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much for the answers.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, thanks. I just had a question on how we should think about the level of accretion possible here relative to the consensus $7.97. Because I guess thinking about the deployment of proceeds into all buyback or M&A and the lost operating income of $323 million doesn't seem to quite get me back to $7.97. And I hear you guys that you're not giving the guidance on the tax rate or specific cost saves, but I'm wondering. Should we be thinking about this as significantly accretive to $7.97 to compensate you guys for the risk of having to do this, or is $7.97 more the target now for 2018? Thanks.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: So, Ryan, what we've said is we're going to be accretive to the FactSet $7.97. We haven't given more guidance than that. And what I would say is it is a combination of proceeds and return on those proceeds from the transaction, continued organic revenue growth and margin expansion in our businesses, savings as we bring together the operational model, particularly in IT and real estate, and a reduction in tax rate. So they're the component pieces that get you there.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: And what I might add, Ryan, if I could, we didn't see this, you mentioned risk, compensate for risk. We don't see it that way. I just want to emphasize again. We really see this as an opportunity to take another step forward in a journey that we've been on for over a decade. This is exactly consistent with what we continue to do as we allocate capital, reallocate capital, think about our structure, think about performance improvement, all against a strategy around being the preeminent firm focused on risk, retirement, and health in every single way, and using more and more data and analytics, content, insight as a way to drive that strategy. And so for us, this was a natural progression. In fact, the possibility to do it and serve clients well on the outsourcing side for us made it an imperative. This is something we absolutely had to do because we're excited about what it means for Aon. We're excited about what it means for Blackstone, and we're excited about what it means for our clients. So for us, this wasn't about risk. This was a real step forward that strengthens our firm for the long term. And we'd just say, as we started this conversation, we see this as a real catalyst for shareholder value creation for Aon.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, understood. Thank you. And then I think Christa just mentioned that what can continue to drive accretion here is margin expansion in the remaining businesses. I guess looking at organic growth this year, just in the brokerage side 3%. To have margins expand off of that, are you saying that you think that organic can accelerate off the 3% next year, or do you think that 3% organic growth can still produce margin expansion in that business? Thanks.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Ryan, one of the things we're extremely proud of is in 2016, our risk business, we delivered 3% organic revenue growth overall and record margins of 24.5%. And one of the things that we've mentioned many times is, because of the investments we made over the last several years in data and analytics, we can drive margin expansion quite substantially at lower levels of growth. It's certainly not our aspiration. Our aspiration is to grow higher than we are today. But we are getting return on those investments in data and analytics, and that is driving more than half of the margin expansion you've seen in each of the last three years. And so we're very confident about continued margin expansion in our risk business.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you for the questions.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Thanks very much, everybody, for joining the call, and we look forward to our discussion next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. And thanks for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. And that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2016 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of AON Plc. Sir, you may begin.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. And second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics; each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year; grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to slide three. In the third quarter organic revenue growth was 4%, including growth across every major business, highlighted by 5% growth in both the Americas Retail Brokerage and Outsourcing businesses. Operating margin increased 10 basis points, reflecting modest improvement in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 4% to $1.29, primarily reflecting effective capital management and underlying operational improvements. And finally, free cash flow for the nine months is up 24%, reflecting strong cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures. Overall, we continued to strengthen the firm with positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016, highlighted by solid organic revenue growth across both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions and strong double-digit growth in free cash flow. Turning to slide four. On the second topic of growth and investment, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior-year quarter, driven by improved growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives to maximize return on invested capital and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with management of our renewal book portfolio through a proactive client partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, including record retention rates of 94% in the U.S. and EMEA. New business generation of roughly $265 million in the third quarter across Retail Brokerage, including double-digit growth in Latin America, Affinity and EMEA and another consecutive quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail, 22 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance, increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon Inpoint, a growing business where we help carriers to become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the Risk Insight Platform, which now captures 3.3 million trades and nearly $165 billion of bound premium, as well as our reinsurer dashboard, ReView. Another example is our Aon broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, we recently announced the addition of Stroz Friedberg, a global leader in cyber security, bringing together two of the world's most highly skilled teams focused on cyber risk mitigation. This investment extends Aon's leading position in cyber risk brokerage and creates a comprehensive cyber advisory group, allowing Aon's clients to have access to the most advanced thinking and solutions in the industry. Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 4% in the prior-year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw solid growth across all regions, U.S. Retail, Latin America and Canada, including growth across all businesses, Property-Casualty, Health and Benefits and Affinity. Results were highlighted by double-digit growth in Affinity's Consumer Solutions Group and strong growth in U.S. Retail, driven by record new business generation and retention. In international, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 1% in the prior-year quarter. The impact from pricing remains modestly negative on average driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region, while exposures are modestly improving. Similar to the Americas, we saw growth across every major region, including EMEA, Asia and the Pacific. Results were highlighted by continued strength in New Zealand, record retention in EMEA and solid growth in Asia. In Continental Europe, we continue to see signs of improving growth, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite a macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in various countries. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to minus 4% in the prior-year quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further validating our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by continued net new business generation in treaty and growth in facultative placements. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact globally. As highlighted in our prior discussions, pricing continues to moderate, ceding (7:03) demand continues to increase and capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk, and other emerging risks such as cyber liability. We believe new opportunities for growth, combined with Aon's industry-leading data and analytics and integrated capital solutions, have positioned our Reinsurance business for long-term growth. Turning to HR Solutions, organic revenue growth was 4% overall with solid growth across high demand areas where we continue to invest in innovative solutions and client serving capabilities. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends, including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A strong area of growth has been delegated investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to almost $90 billion in five years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets. Continuing investments to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size, and funding choices, including our suite of private healthcare exchanges. We view health as a substantial long-term opportunity. We are the industry leader in managing unique company or employee population needs today and our superior advisory capabilities allow us to help clients evolve when their needs change and priorities shift and as the healthcare landscape continues to evolve. We also continue to invest in software-as-a-service models in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demands, as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in data analytics in our health, retirement investment and talent rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior-year quarter. Results primarily reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services, as an increasing amount of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage their retirement assets. We saw growth in communications consulting, where clients are proactively preparing their employees in advance of annual enrollment season as well certain project-related work. Results in the quarter also include solid growth in our compensation consulting practice. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 5%, similar to the prior-year quarter. Results reflect strong growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. And we saw strong growth in our health exchange business for off-cycle enrollments and certain project-related work. Results in the quarter were partially offset by an anticipated modest decline in benefits administration. Overall, in HR Solutions, we are firmly on track for improved organic revenue growth in both businesses for the second half of the year, driven by continued growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, combined with seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. In summary, our performance marks another quarter of progress, reflecting strong organic revenue growth across both segments, effective capital management and substantial free cash flow generation towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. Looking forward, we expect a strong finish to the year, as we head into our seasonally strongest quarter with continued long-term growth driven by our unmatched level of investment in advisory and analytic capabilities across our portfolio. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our results reflect solid organic revenue growth across both segments, substantial free cash flow generation and effective capital management, highlighted by $300 million of share repurchase in the quarter and more than $1 billion of share repurchase year-to-date. Now, let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page six of the presentation. Our core EPS performance excluding certain items increased 4% to $1.29 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.24 in the prior-year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization. Also included in the results was a $0.01 per share favorable impact related to foreign currency translation due primarily to the U.S. dollar strength against the pound. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have a modest positive impact in the fourth quarter. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic growth was 3%, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 20.9% and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior-year quarter. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of modest operating income growth in the third quarter. Operating margin improvement of 10 basis points reflects solid organic revenue growth and an 80 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the timing of certain compensation expenses and a minus 50 basis point unfavorable impact from higher E&O expense in the quarter. For the first nine months, operating margin improved 60 basis points and operating income increased 3%. Anticipating a strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track to deliver improved operating income growth and further margin expansion for the full year, reflecting continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%. Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 17.1%, and operating income decreased 4% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating income results include a $7 million or minus 70 basis points of legacy IT contract costs incurred in the quarter. This impact as well as an anticipated minus 70 basis point unfavorable impact related to previous portfolio repositioning activities and a minus 20 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency more than offset solid organic growth in the quarter. For the first nine months, operating margin decreased 70 basis points and operating income decreased 8%. As discussed previously, we continue to take steps to reduce certain costs that remained after the disposition of two businesses in the last 12 months as well as optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate, and global procurement. Combined with an expected strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track for continued margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22%. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $42 million compared to $45 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest income was $1 million compared to $3 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense decreased $2 million to $70 million due to a decline in costs related to certain derivative hedging programs which have now expired. Other income in both the current and prior-year quarters included gains on certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $70 million per quarter of interest expense. Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations excluding the applicable tax impact associated with non-cash pension settlements in the first half of the year increased to 18.2% compared to 16% in the prior-year quarter. Changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments impacted the adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter. The prior-year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 269.6 million in the third quarter compared to 283.8 million in the prior-year quarter as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased 2.7 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $300 million in the third quarter. The company has $3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 263.5 million and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 269 million, subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At September 30, 2016 cash and short-term investments increased to $946 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.2 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.4 times, similar to the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months increased 14% or $180 million to $1.5 billion, driven by lower pension contributions and increase in net income, working capital improvements and lower cash taxes. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 24% or $252 million to $1.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $72 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect to deliver strong double-digit free cash flow growth for the full-year 2016. Reflecting further progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full-year 2017. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full-year 2017 is not our end goal, as we expect to deliver sustainable strong free cash flow growth on an annual basis beyond 2017. There are four primary areas that we expect to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion for the full-year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last five years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash, of pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $105 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Turning to our pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce the volatility and liability of our plans. In the first half of 2016, we completed two transactions to materially de-risk our pension liabilities in the U.K. And we'll continue to actively manage de-risking opportunities as they make financial sense. Further, we currently expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million to $150 million in 2016 and expect non-cash pension income on an underlying basis to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015. In summary, we delivered solid organic revenue growth, overall operating margin improvement, despite certain anticipated headwinds in the quarter and continued to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth. For the first nine months, results reflect positive performance across each of our key metrics heading into our seasonally strongest quarter. With a strong finish to the year, we are well on track in 2016 to deliver meaningful progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2017. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Mr. Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is open.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Hey there. Good morning, guys.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Hey, Dave.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to talk about just the rest of the year here, as we go in I know you're feeling good about the momentum, and fourth quarter is typically your seasonally strongest, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the visibility or maybe a percent of the pipeline that you already know for revenue that you have in hand versus maybe what's left to do and then I don't think I heard you guys talk much about the exchange outlook for next year. I know you've got Starbucks under your belt, what are the other moving parts, any customer losses or other wins to flag there for growth in 2017?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: David, let me start, overall, as you know, we've been – I described Aon Client Promise in my commentary and part of that is literally how we support clients every day and the direct result of that measurable is retention and something we also call rollovers, not only keeping the client but also doing more and serving them more effectively. And if you look at where we are, we're a 90% plus retention business, 94% in the U.S. and the fourth quarter is our strongest quarter by far. But you can imagine we've got pretty good visibility into momentum and direction for that and feel good about our ability to close the year. And in terms of on the healthcare exchange piece, happy to talk more about it if you like. We feel very, very good about our progress. We have great momentum on the exchange side, but I want to emphasize for us this is part of a much, much bigger platform, much bigger perspective around the health platform overall, in which we're bringing a very broad set of solutions to the table: big companies, medium-size companies, small companies and a complete suite of efforts to the table. And for us on the health side, we're very excited about it. This is a double-digit growth opportunity for us. We're already achieving but we see more potential going forward, with substantial margin improvement potential as well. So we feel good about the momentum for the fourth quarter and into 2017.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Can you talk – maybe just put some numbers around the exchange growth enrollment for this year going into 2017?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: So here is what I would say, as we think about the exchange piece and we step back. For us – and I'll just be very direct – this is an incredibly positive outcome for us with great momentum, but we continue to be confused/interested in all the confusion in the market. The numbers are really not apples-to-apples in any way, shape or form. So for us the enrollment numbers really aren't as relevant at this point anymore. We've got so many off-cycle enrollments now on the horizon of project related revenue, which is much more substantial than ever before, and this really ends up being a platform for us. We're seeing things like elective benefits, whether it's life, home, long-term disability, short-term disability, it's a very, very positive set of developments for us. And if you looked at it as a business, again, less about enrollment, about the business overall, this is double-digit revenue growth on exchanges for us. We moved to profitability last year. It's going to obviously be stronger this year. But I'd say from a macro standpoint, I mean, look at where we are in the exchanges. This is strong and steady growth. We've done the largest active, the largest retiree. You mentioned Starbucks, we don't mention our clients, but we were very privileged. Starbucks has a well-earned reputation for defining excellence in employee value proposition and we help them deliver on that through our exchange. So we're very excited about what that means overall. So, for us, this is just an exceptionally strong platform for us and I would say our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. So there's no waning, there's no backing up, there's no deferring, it's as strong as it's ever been. Having said that, Dave, I still want to emphasize, and we've been saying this from the beginning, this is not a change in direction. The exchanges are an exceptionally strong solution for a subset of our clients, but it's really part of the overall health platform, which we feel very, very strong about.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Sure. I get that. That's great. The free cash flow, I want to come back to that. I know you guys are trending really well this year. Is there anything to look for in the fourth quarter? It seems like you're going to be pretty darn close to the $2.4 billion goal this year, and want to know if you could help us – help remind us if there were any unusual puts or takes throughout the year-to-date numbers as we bridge into next year?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Dave, there's nothing particularly unusual this year. I would note last year we had an extraordinary legal legacy litigation settlement of about $140 million. But we feel really good about the free cash flow growth for the full year 2016. We're on track for double-digit growth in free cash flow this year. And we're well on track to the $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017. So we feel really good about the growth in cash flow. And we feel equally good about the way in which we're deploying that cash on a really disciplined return on capital basis. And so, we continue to see share repurchase as the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon, it really sets the bar, but we're equally – we've actually done over $0.5 billion of M&A year-to-date and we feel really good about the opportunities, like cyber, like elective benefits, which are huge growth opportunities for us. And so, we're very excited about the deployment of the cash, as much as we are about the growth in free cash flow itself.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay, great. And just my last one real quick is on the HR Solutions. I think you guys had previously in the last quarter talked about income growth being flat year-over-year for this quarter. Obviously, it was down about 4%. I'm wondering, what changed there that caused the deviation from what you guys thought it would be. Is it perhaps the – I think you guys had flagged the legacy IT contract cost coming...?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yeah. I think that was simply it, Dave, there was $7 million of IT contracts that were legacy and that was really it. And then, look, FX was a slight negative too, but I mean, I think we were largely in line. And it was really just that IT item.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And is that totally put to bed at this point or can that continue to dribble on?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: It actually creates slight upside going forward.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: All right. Thanks for the questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. In Risk Solutions organic growth, I was surprised it didn't slow this quarter, given you had said there would be some revenue shifting from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. Can you just quantify that and should we expect some tailwind in the fourth quarter from timing?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes. So, Sarah, we absolutely said that. And we do believe that Q4 will be – it is always our seasonally strongest quarter, and it will remain so. So we absolutely expect that revenue – and there was a small movement of clients from Q3 to Q4, really lining up buying patterns, Sarah, with the annual calendar year. And so we expect that trend to continue. What I think you saw in the third quarter was continued strong retention and continued strong new business. And so we feel really good about Q3 and we feel exceptionally good about Q4.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then how do you think about the buyback in the fourth quarter in light of the acquisition that you just made?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yeah. So as I said, we've got extremely strong free cash flow for the full year, Sarah, double-digit free cash flow on track for the $2.4 billion next year. As we think about deployment of that cash, share repurchase is the highest return on capital item. And so we continue to deploy cash on a return on capital basis. And for us to invest in M&A, the return on capital of that M&A has to be better than buyback. And we've seen some opportunities this year, which are in extraordinarily attractive areas, such as cyber and elective benefits. And we fully expect to continue buyback in Q4.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. But could you quantify the Stroz acquisition, and would that slow the buyback at all?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Sarah, we don't – we're not revealing the purchase price on Stroz and we don't give guidance on share repurchase.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks for the answers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Your line is open.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Hey, Adam.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Some questions around the Stroz deal. You already had a cyber consulting operation. So could you talk about what the differences are between your existing operation and Stroz? And then when you put them together, what can you do different or better with these organizations together?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Yeah. We really are excited about the addition of Stroz Friedberg in addition to some exceptional talent we brought in on the topic of cyber. And let me describe kind of the rationale behind it. First of all, our clients tell us every day cyber is becoming an increasingly important concern for them, important risk for them. And if you think about what insurance has been able to do in the context of that risk, we've roughly placed together, the entire industry about, call it $2 billion, a little over $2 billion in premium and, Adam, that's good, that's terrific but think about the $2 billion in premium in the context of $400 billion in client reported losses. And so for us, we've only tapped the surface and started really delivering on the needs of our clients. And if you ask yourself – and by the way in the context of that, as you described – appreciate you describing it, we have an awesome capability, the best in the industry, leading position, exceptional capability in the context of what insurance does. What we've essentially said is we've got to do more for our clients. We've got to take the capability we've got and build on it, and the way you build on it, is not to bring more insurance expertise in, but bring more cyber expertise in and really help insurers and capital understand how to quantify and deal with cyber risk in a way in which you would actually open up more capital. So instead of $2 million in premium against $400 billion in reported losses. We could do much, much better than that. And Stroz Friedberg is simply the preeminent platform in the world in our view around how to do that. So this is a firm that's publicly reported, has covered and helped remediate, understand, identify and deal with some of the most sophisticated complex cyber challenges in the world today. Imagine combining that capability with what we have from a capital and insurance side. That's going to open up just tremendous opportunities we believe to bring better solutions to our clients in a much more comprehensive way, which is why we're very excited to bring these assets together and I can tell you, we've had incredible client reaction. They see this logic immediately. They see the opportunity to take what is a very distributed risk in cyber because it attacks you from everywhere. They know it requires an integrated solution and this is now the first time they're going to get a chance to put some of those pieces together and this is really a role the risk manager can play to take a broader view across the organization to help their CIOs and CSOs do this in a more effective way. So, for us, this is terrific and for Stroz Friedberg, who are excited to be able to actually take the capability they deliver to clients every day and back that up with capital. So if you think about it, it really is a net-net new creation of opportunity for our clients and in doing so a net new for Aon.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. And will that be reported in the Risk Solutions business?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Yes, it will.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then one more question on the HR BPO, how is the pipeline – I mean that business has been doing very well, grown nicely, how is the pipeline going into 2017 and are you doing any work on the financial side of the house?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: First of all, it's going exceptionally well. Again, the business colleagues have done a terrific job in really building out and driving it, I think we're describing it as (31:22) the work we do on the HR, implementations in the cloud and we are the leader in that, biggest in Workday in the US, biggest in the UK, reinforced by capability we brought into the firm. And then as you described, even a bigger opportunity is what's going on in the finance side. And Aon in particular is leading the pack on that as well, not just in implementation, but we're doing it for us as well. So just like everything else we've done on behalf of our clients is something Aon participates in. So we're very excited about the possibilities for our clients in this category and the pipeline is exceptionally strong.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: And just on that, is there any seasonality to that when the revenue hits from that business?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Not really. It comes in over time. Again, it's driven by client need.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Quentin McMillan from KBW. Your line is open.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks very much, guys. Christa, I wanted to touch on a free cash flow comment that you made in your prepared remarks. You said you have a further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million from working capital from procurement and from accounts payable. So you guys increased by about $100 million on both receivables and accounts payable in this quarter, which is obviously pretty strong numbers. Just wondering, that $500 million, maybe what's the runway, how long will that take? And in addition you also talked about lower cash tax payments, do you believe that there is opportunity to go below the 19% and maybe where can that go over time?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Sure. So, Quentin, I think, on the first question on working capital, what we would say is, we really think about it as days sales outstanding, so the days it takes to collect cash from clients and days payables, which is the days that it takes – we collect cash or we pay suppliers. And right now we are – we run negative working capital and we believe for a professional services firm that being working capital neutral is the right goal. And in fact, in some of our leading countries we're actually working capital positive. So we certainly see it's more than achievable. And so, to get from where we are today to working capital neutral is a little over $500 million in free cash flow. So we feel really good about the ability to collect a further $500 million of working capital. It will take multiple years. It will take eight years to 10 years to get there because it's not some Big Bang effort. It's continued improvements in process, it's continued improvements in contract terms, a number of our contract terms are annual or multi-year agreements and so it will absolutely take a long period of time to get there. So I don't want to overplay the amount you're going to get in any one year. So that's on the working capital. And then the other thing I think I would note is, as you look at our working capital you can see the improvements in receivables. If you divide receivables by revenue, trailing 12 months, from Q3 last 12 months, you can see we actually improved DSO on an externally reported basis by two days. And so we continue to make progress. And I'll tell you that on BPO, we improved by four days. You can't see that externally, but we are continuing to make improvements on both fronts. And then in terms of the opportunity on the tax side, what I would say is we really feel good about the sustainability of our 19% effective tax rate. We do run a global capital pool. We do see statutory rates around the world declining, particularly in the U.K. And we have a growing business in emerging markets, which happen to have lower tax rates. And so we feel really good, therefore, about the sustainability of the 19% and, therefore, opportunity to have improvements in cash taxes, as cash taxes catch up to the lower effective tax rate.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thank you so much. And then just one follow-up question. Moving back to HR BPO, can you help us just understand what the size of that business is, where the margins are currently and what the kind of cloud-based solutions implementation could do for margins over whether it be 2017 or even over the next few years?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Sure. So it's about a $500 million business today, and we feel really good about the progress in cloud. If you rewound five years, we had 30-plus clients who had on-premises BPO. And today it's in the mid-teens with every one of those clients moving from on premises to cloud with us. And so it is a fantastic value proposition for clients to do this. On average, clients are saving 30% of costs in moving to the cloud. And they get a much more effective solution, and so we do see the majority of our clients moving that way. And we expect that to continue. In terms of the margin profile of the business, today, it is a low-single-digit margin business. And it's moving to a mid-teens margin business over time. And so we do see that opportunity, primarily driven by that cloud growth, which is enormous. And as Greg described, I really just described the cloud opportunity in HR. And there is a cloud opportunity, which we're increasingly seeing as very happy HR customers actually want to move to cloud financials as well, to actually bring together and get the same value proposition they got in HR in financials.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning. Christa, I just want to clarify one number. You mentioned like you did $500 million of merger amortization year-to-date. But in the cash flow for the first nine months is about $200 million. I just wonder if that number or figure is correct or is that including the fourth quarter's acquisitions as well?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: It's including Stroz Friedberg.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And how material is Stroz to – in terms of revenue as well as margin for 2017?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yeah, we haven't given that number. What I can say is that we will report about $6 million of deal cost related to that cyber acquisition in Q4.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Okay great. And then stepping back, if you look at margin, relatively stable year-over-year, but the revenue growth is pretty strong. I just wonder, is that you investing more in the business, that could held back a little bit about the margin expansion, or do you think it's just one quarter thing and you will continue to see meaningful margin expansion if the growth rate remains strong?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yeah. So, I would say, Q3 was exactly in line with our expectations. We did guide essentially to flat and if you look at year-to-date, we've got margin expansion and we're heading into our strongest quarter of the year, Q4, which we feel really good about, therefore, we're on track for substantial margin expansion in the full year.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: I would encourage you, as you think about Q3, it was always our weakest quarter. We think about this from an annual standpoint; I think Christa captures it very well. We're on track in 2016, exactly where we had hoped to be.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. Lastly, on Brexit and what's the impact you have seen when talking with your clients in both the London market as well as your consulting side. Is there any sign of slowing down or temporary slowing down of management consulting projects?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: I would say, Kai, in many respects the uncertainty around Brexit for us as an advisor to clients on risk, retirement and health, has actually increased in terms of helping them understand that, deal with that set of uncertainties and we think that's going to persist for a period of time. So, for us, we're helping clients actually sort through a very complicated situation and that will continue for the foreseeable future.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: What about London market?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Same in the London market. I'm really describing the global mindset. What I just described could be doubled or tripled in the London market because that's actually where the intensity is greatest. Clients are thinking for example, if I've got retirement plans that cut across the Continent, how do I deal with those? If I've got health plans that cut across, how do you deal with those? And then on the risk side, how do you manage complexity across markets that are going to change and emerge a bit. So, for us, it's an opportunity to advise clients and advise markets on how to think about this overall. So net-net, when we think about the impact to places like Lloyd's, a very important market in the world, we continue to see them be very strong. We continue to see them work to adapt to what the new world will be, and there is lots of levers they can pull to adapt and do that.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Charles Sebaski from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the M&A that you guys have done so far. I guess I'm just trying to rectify the transactions with the, I guess, dispositions being greater than, just the negative revenue reported in the acquisition/disposition. Would we expect that to go positive relative to these deals next year or why these – are there more dispositions to come that offset the acquisitions...?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Just to set the framework, Charles, so to think back to commentary we've had on these calls for literally going back almost 10 years. Everything we do is built off a foundation that Christa has set up and applied across the firm around return on invested capital. And what are the ways we can actually apply capital in a way to serve our clients most effectively. And you've seen us do that over the years. And if you step back over the last 10 years, we've deployed probably, call it, $15 billion in capital of which, call it, roughly half, a little more than that, buyback, roughly half is on some acquisitions. So net-net, this is obviously a very positive story and will continue to be a very positive story for us. Within that context you'll see us continuously try to look for ways to optimize return on invested capital on behalf of clients, strengthen the firm, double down in areas that we can grow and build capability in the areas of risk, retirement, health, talent, et cetera, communications. So you see us doing that. That will drive everything we do, it's also why in that context you hear Christa describe and I describe, the team describe, buyback sets the benchmark for that. And then against that, we make acquisitions that are accretive against that benchmark. And that really has been the formulation and foundation of exactly everything we've done and we'll continue do that. And we're less worried about kind of, a quarter plus or minus or a year plus or minus, we're worried about and focused on, in fact, maniacally focused on how we build this for Aon over time.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: And the other thing I'd say, Charles, is the disposition costs do go away in Q1, 2017 because you've then lapped the significant dispositions. Obviously, you've got lost operating income, you've got stranded costs like half floor of real estate or half a server leftover. And I think just to dimensionalize the impact of disposition year-to-date, we've lost $141 million of revenue, we've lost $10 million of PTI (42:16), so that gives you a sense of year-to-date impact. But we will lap that in Q1 next year. And then, obviously, as Greg described, we are actually acquiring great talent and capability on the M&A side. And you'll see that continue to grow.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. On the margin side for Risk, you talked about in the quarter that there was an 80 bp benefit from foreign currency translation. I'm curious if you could let us know what is that on a nine month basis. The 23.4% adjusted margin for Risk, what's the embedded FX benefit in that number?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Hang on. Just trying to find that number for you.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And I guess...
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: 20 basis points – 50 basis points, sorry.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: But for the year overall, when you think about FX and the impact on our business, as we think about FX overall – again, we reflect back in terms of less about the quarter and less about the nine months – I think, it's got a marginal impact on margins overall for the year in terms of where we are across the board. We use that number.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And I guess this is just a general thought on 2017, I guess, my question is, a good problem to have – and not maybe a problem – but at record retention and record new business in Risk, does that set up a comparable challenge in 2017 for organic growth? Knowing that if you're at 94% retentions and your ceiling is at 100%, does it just create – an excellent result, makes a tough year-over-year comp going into next year or you just don't – the things that are transpiring don't set up like that?
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: We don't see it that way, Charles, as you might expect. In fact, in many respects, what we've done is invest very, very heavily to increase operating leverage in the business, make the acquisitions Christa described to strengthen our position. It frankly gives us the ability to create net new demand on behalf of clients and substantially increase growth trajectory. You've actually seen it, if you think about our performance in the third quarter. What this is a reflection of is certainly not the insurance environment. It's really a reflection of our ability to create net new demand and help clients succeed. So if you think about it, our view is – think about some the three or four areas that we look to, to grow, obviously, there is all the traditional areas around property, casualty, D&O. And we've made this multi-year investment to increase operating leverage in something called Aon Client Promise. This is not just talk. This is very real mechanics on how we interact and support clients every day. That's what's resulted in record new retention. That's resulted in record new business. So I emphasize record new business. And yet we're still relatively small when you think about the opportunity to build market share globally. So we've got a capability to build market share and compete globally in a way that we think is actually quite extraordinary, and that's called a tradition. In addition to that, we have capabilities into areas outside the core that we're investing heavily in. Call it, a couple of examples, in Affinity and Health and Benefits, these are two areas reported up through our Risk business that are $1 billion-plus businesses growing well above mid-single-digit with opportunities for margin expansion. So this is now a second full category completely outside anything that we've just described. And then, finally, very exciting for us is we've made substantial investments in data and analytics. We believe more than anyone else and you see that coming out – a manifestation of real things about clients, I mean, Aon Client Treaty is simply the single biggest transaction in the history Lloyd's. We've got thousands of clients now taking advantage of that. It's incredibly impactful for them. Aon Inpoint, 45 plus carriers onboard work with that. Aon Review, what we did in U.S. mortgage, we literally are creating a $10 billion business out of – just net new. So in many respects, Charles, we would describe what we have come to as a set of opportunities to accelerate our ability to grow in the current environment, irrespective of what happens over in the insurance environment. So, for us, we're excited about the progress and we have real confidence that 2017, 2018 will bring more opportunity. And the final thing I would say about it is this idea of operating leverage. We're not just putting on net new revenue. This is revenue that we believe has operational leverage, different than the revenue we put on three years or four years ago. And how we've actually brought it on board, which means we've got margin opportunities which are substantial.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much for all the color.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question is from Mr. Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, thank you very much for fitting me in. I just wanted to go through the 270 basis point items in the HR Solutions I guess, one is, you're closing some offices and you're shutting down a server. Is that a reserve set up for the full cost or did you spend all that in the third quarter and, two, can we expect there are other items like this as you, for the long-term plan for higher margins, are there more of these restructuring type items to come?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes, so, on the IT cost, this was related to a legacy IT contact. It was a one-time expense and it will not be repeated. And then the other $7 million item is really related to dispositions and it's really the stranded costs that remain in that business. As I described, half a floor or half sever and we're continuing to reduce those costs over time.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And that's the point, are there other initiatives that might come up that are similar to this over the foreseeable future that have a long-term margin expanding goal but short-term might be a headwind?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yes, I mean, I guess I would say absolutely, Josh, because as we think about return on capital for the firm, are we going to make investments that we think drive higher return longer-term, you bet, we are. I mean, you saw that in M&A, in the cyber example Greg described. You see it organically in the kinds of things we're investing in in Health and Benefits and Affinity. And so you will continue to see that occur where we see the return on capital being substantially attractive for Aon.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then on Chuck's question, obviously the fourth quarter is the strongest quarter. He was talking about the favorable tailwind from currency translation. Given the higher revenue base for the quarter, is that going to be – should we think about, 80 basis points is a significant amount. You amortize that over a larger revenue base. It's a big, big benefit to the quarter, or is 80 basis points really just a unique thing for 3Q?
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Yeah. I wouldn't over rotate on the 80 basis points. I would say, most of the countries in which we operate we have local revenue and local expense and you're translating back to U.S. dollars. And the U.S. dollar has been strong. And so I think what you saw in Q3 was an unusual situation with the pound. And so I just – I would not over rotate on the 80 basis point number.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Christa Davies - Aon Plc: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over back to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc: Thanks very much. And appreciate everybody being on the call today. Thanks very much.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. Thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. And it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2016 results as well as having been posted on our website. I would now like to hand the call over to Greg Case.
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Thank you. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to slide three. In the second quarter organic revenue growth was 3%, highlighted by 4% growth in Retail Brokerage with 6% growth in the International Brokerage business. Operating margin increased 30 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 6% to $1.39, reflecting operational improvement and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow for the six months increased $224 million to $660 million, driven by a 32% increase in cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures. Overall, results continue to reflect the strength of our industry-leading platform in a volatile microeconomic environment with positive performance across each of our key metrics, for both the second quarter and the first six months of 2016. Turning to slide four on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior-year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with management of our renewal book portfolio through a proactive client partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage; new business generation of roughly $280 million across Retail Brokerage, including double digit growth in Asia and EMEA and another quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail; 21 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance; and increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon Inpoint, where we empower carriers to become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the Risk Insight Platform, which now captures 3.2 million trades and more than $160 billion of bound premium, and Review, our reinsurer dashboard. Another example is our Aon broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions. A great example of client impact in this area was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's, enabling our clients to access 20% of pre-secured unique co-insurance capacity. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, in the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Univers, an elective benefits enrollment and communications firm, strengthening our ability to serve clients as the leading provider of a comprehensive benefit solutions. Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continued to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw double digit growth in Affinity, driven by growth across all product lines. In U.S. Retail, we saw modest growth driven by record new business generation and strong retention. Results also reflect modest growth in Latin America, driven by new business generation, despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region. In international, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to 2% in the prior-year quarter. The impact from pricing remains negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region, while exposures are modestly improving. Results reflect solid growth across every major region, including EMEA, Asia, and the Pacific, driven by strength in both new business generation and management of the renewal book portfolio. In Continental Europe we delivered the highest organic revenue growth in over six years, with growth across all product lines, including Health & Benefits, Affinity, and Retail, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in many countries. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to a negative 1% in the prior-year quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, cedent demand in Treaty, and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact internationally. As the rate of price declines continue to moderate, capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk, and other emerging risks, such as cyber liability. And as highlighted in our prior discussions, new business opportunities for growth, combined with industry-leading data and analytics, has positioned our Reinsurance business for a return to modest growth in 2016. Turning to HR Solutions, organic revenue growth was 1% overall, as growth across high demand areas where we continue to invest was partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration, and unfavorable timing. We continue to strengthen our industry-leading platform with investments in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities that reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends, including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees. A strong area of growth has been delegated investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in five years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets. Continued investments to strengthen our industry-leading position of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size, and funding choices, including our suite of private healthcare exchanges. We continue to see strong and steady growth across our entire suite of exchange solutions for companies of all sizes and industries. Starbucks recently joined a growing list of employers on our Active Healthcare Exchange. We're proud to help Starbucks introduce a new health solution that enables Starbucks' U.S. employees to have greater choice, opportunities for cost savings and personalized support to select and get the most out of their health insurance coverage. Starbucks' decision to adopt a consumer-driven approach to health benefits underscores the sustainability of our exchange model and proven results that our exchange has achieved on behalf of clients over the past several years. We also continue to invest in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand, as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing into data and analytics in our health and talent and rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions, in Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1%. Results reflect growth in core pension solutions where we provide clients an in-depth approach to pension risk management and the best solutions to take advantage of the market shift from defined benefit to defined contribution. We also saw continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services as an increasing number of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage their retirement assets. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable timing of revenue in our compensation consulting practice. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was flat versus the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth continue in HR BPO, driven by new client wins and cloud-based solutions. Results in the quarter were offset by a modest decline in benefits administration as well as a decline in project-related work around lump sum windows for pension plans that created an unfavorable comparison in the prior-year quarter. Overall, in HR Solutions, we expect to deliver improved organic growth in the second half of the year, driven primarily by growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, a modest benefit from revenue timing that impacted this quarter, and seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. In summary, for both the second quarter and the first six months, we delivered solid organic revenue growth against a volatile macroeconomic environment, improved operational performance, and generated substantial free cash flow. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, against continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, our industry-leading platform delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, with positive performance across each of our four key metrics. Results reflect organic growth in both segments, strong operating margin expansion in Risk Solutions and substantial free cash flow generation. Now, let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page six of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 6% to $1.39 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.31 in the prior-year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization and non-cash expenses related to certain pension settlements. There was no material impact on earnings per share related to foreign currency translation in the second quarter. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have no material impacts going forward. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 24.9% and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 70 basis points includes a 50 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 20 basis points in the quarter. Operating improvement in the second quarter reflects organic growth in each business, including Reinsurance, and improved returns on our investments in data analytics across the portfolio. For the first six months, operating margin improved 80 basis points, including a 40 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Our performance in the first half firmly positions the Risk Solutions segment for further margin expansion towards our long-term target of 26%. With normal seasonal weakness in Q3 and seasonal strength in Q4, we expect a stronger second half of the year for Risk Solutions. Included in our expectation are two underlying adjustments. We expect certain client revenue to shift from Q3 into Q4, and we expect a shift in certain underlying compensation expense from Q4 into Q3. As a result, we expect normal quarterly patterning to be more pronounced this year, with modest operating income growth in Q3, significant operating income growth in Q4 and no change to the full year expected performance. Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 1%. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 12.8% and operating income decreased 8% compared to the prior-year quarter. For the first six months, the operating margin decreased 90 basis points and operating income decreased 11%. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of flat to down in the first half. Performance was primarily driven by investments for future growth, timing of certain revenue in our compensation consulting business and an anticipated reduction in operating income reflecting the disposal of two businesses in previous quarters. While we continue to reduce certain expenses that supported those noncore businesses, the monetization of those businesses in previous quarters generated other income gains and cash proceeds that will ultimately be deployed to higher return on invested capital opportunities. Looking forward, in line with our previous guidance for HR Solutions, we expect a strong second half of the year. This expectation reflects normal seasonality in Q3 of relatively flat operating income growth and normal seasonal strength in Q4 of significant operating income growth, with full year results continuing to deliver solid organic revenue growth, further margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22% and increased operating income for the full year. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide nine. Unallocated expenses were $43 million compared to $41 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest income was $3 million compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense increased $5 million to $73 million, due to an overlap of long-term debt placed in the first quarter with debt that matured in the second quarter. Other income was immaterial as the losses on certain long-term investments and foreign exchange hedging programs were offset by the sale of a certain business. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $71 million per quarter of interest expense. Turning to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations excluding the applicable tax impacts associated with non-cash pension settlements decreased to 17.4% compared to 18% in the prior-year quarter. This was driven by changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments. The prior-year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 6% to 269.8 million in the second quarter compared to 286.7 million in the prior-year quarter driven by share repurchase in previous quarters. The company did not repurchase shares in the second quarter. Strong cash flow generation was used in the near term for $500 million of debt that matured in the quarter and an attractive acquisition in the quarter in the elective benefit space. We expect to return to deploying capital to share repurchases in the second half of the year, reflecting our highest return on invested capital. The company has $3.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30 was 265.8 million. And there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q3 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 271 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance, and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At June 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments was $689 million. Total debt outstanding declined to approximately $6.2 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis declined 2.4 times, reflecting the extinguishment of $500 million of debt that came due in the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first six months increased 32%, or $186 million, to $764 million, driven by an increase in net income, a decrease in cash tax payments, a decline in cash paid for pension contributions, and underlying working capital improvements. Strong progress in the first six months of the year. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 51%, or $224 million, to $660 million, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $38 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward we expect to deliver double digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2016 and are firmly on track to deliver against our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow return. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal, as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gaps between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last five years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions, CapEx and restructurings, which we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Turning to our pension plan. We continue to take significant steps to reduce volatility and liability. In the first half of 2016, we completed two transactions to materially de-risk our pension liabilities in the UK. The first was a buy-in completed with assets in the trust to reduce the size of our largest risk within certain UK pension schemes. And secondly, through a lump sum offering, Aon was able to reduce interest rate, investment and longevity risk associated with certain UK pension liabilities. These transactions resulted in $62 million of non-cash settlement charges and related advisory fees, which are adjusted for in our second quarter results. Both of these transactions were completed prior to the Brexit vote as a continuation of our de-risking efforts. As a result, our UK pension scheme funding status remained relatively flat through the Brexit result despite the recent fall in the UK interest rates and market volatility. Further, we expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect non-cash pension income, excluding the expenses related to the described transactions, to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015. In summary, we delivered solid results for the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 and continue to take certain steps to strengthen the return on invested capital and free cash flow. Against continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, we expect improved organic revenue growth and operational performance in the second half of 2016, primarily driven by seasonal strength in Q4. Our industry-leading platform and innovative investments across data analytics continue to position the firm for long-term growth, increased operational leverage and substantial free cash flow generation towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you, ma'am. Our first question comes from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Hi, Sarah.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: First on the Starbucks announcement, how should we think about the benefit of that opportunity to the top and bottom line?
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Well, first of all, Sarah, let me just start with overall. We're just really pleased, we're excited, we're proud to partner with Starbucks. This firm obviously, as you know, has got a long history of providing industry-leading benefits to its partners or employees, and it's really who they are as a company. They've been doing this for a long time. But they're also an industry leader on the healthcare side, committed not only to providing partners with access to healthcare, but also, candidly, shaping the role of the future employer based healths across the entire country. So, this for us is a very – and an innovative company in multiple ways who we partnered with to provide better choice, better transparency for their employees. So we're very excited about doing that. And this for us is just a continuation with a host of other companies who've joined the exchange who want to make a difference on behalf of their employees. And it's one option as part of our overall health platform, which, as we said before, we really love. We love the set of opportunities here to support and help clients and this is just a continuation of that. So, as we've said before, we're going to continue to drive performance in HR Solutions. You'll see that for the year. Starbucks will be included in that, and that will just be a continuation.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, given the decline in interest rates year-to-date, should we anticipate any higher pension contributions than what's outlined on page 11 of the slides, given that's as of year-end 2015?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. And the reason for that is we've really taken substantial efforts over the last 10 years to close our plans, freeze them and de-risk them. And so, because of that, we're in a position where the pension contributions will not change.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for the answer.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Let me start out just on the inferred (24:50) organic growth in the second half and make sure I understand. So it sounds like it's mostly related to the HR Solutions side. And if that's really the case, can you again walk us through some of the components? I know there is a little bit of timing and it sounded like the typical seasonality that you have, but is there other visibility that you have on project-based work that maybe wasn't there this quarter that you expect to come in later on?
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Dave, the commentary really is applicable to both the risk side of the business and the HR Solutions side of the business. And what you're seeing in HR Solutions is just the natural continuation as this business trends to more of a second half set of engagements, particularly around the fourth quarter set of engagements. So that's really what you're seeing trending here. That's amplified a little bit by some timing that Christa highlighted, but this is just, for us, a natural evolution. The real piece here is our expectation that the year stays exactly the same, there's absolutely no change in terms of what we were thinking about and have been thinking about for the first six months, and in fact, feel good about the trends against that. We see what the pipeline looks like. We see how it's going to evolve and, as I said before, it's really just – if you think about some of the work we've done in HR BPO and in cloud, it's just more of a fourth quarter business than we've seen historically. And then on the risk side, same piece: we expect a stronger second half than we saw in the first half and continued growth in the overall business, so no change to the year.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay, got it. And then on the margin – sorry, there was some background noise. But on the margin, Risk Solutions up 20 basis points. I know I think you said it was up 40 basis points excluding constant currency. Is that sort of in line with what you were looking for or – some of the peers have reported some larger margin expansions with organic growth that hasn't been as robust as yours. So, curious just to hear your thoughts on that. And then can you help us triangulate a little bit on HR Solutions? I know the portfolio repositioning changed a little bit of perhaps the base. And so margins down 30 basis points year-over-year, but I think last quarter, you guys started to give us some facts and figures about how much the portfolio repositioning changed the underlying margin base. So, if you could help give color on that so we understand the down pressure on margins year-over-year, that would be helpful.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So, let's start with risk. I think the first thing I'd say about risk is, I wouldn't over rotate on any one quarter. We do expect a stronger second half to the year in both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions, as Greg said, as we are becoming a more Q4 orientated company just in terms of the patterning of our revenue and operating income. And therefore, we expect for Risk Solutions strong organic revenue growth, margin expansion and operating income growth for the full year 2016. In terms of HR Solutions, I would note, as you said, there is an impact if you look at the first half of the year in terms of the divestitures. And that's having an impact of about $6 million in terms of lost operating income in the first half of the year. And obviously there is some stranded costs associated with those divestitures, which is really why we originally gave guidance in HR Solutions which is down in the first half, up in the second half. And what you're really seeing in the second half is we're working through exiting those stranded costs in Q3 and that's why Q4 will be stronger than Q3.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. So about $6 million of costs you said, right?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: $6 million of operating income.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Of income, right. Okay. And then just lastly just on free cash flow, obviously a strong start. I know there were some easier comps in the first half but as we look into the second half, I can't imagine we keep up with that pace. Yeah, there were some timing events that got pulled forward in the first half here or – maybe just help us bridge to what you might define as double digit growth a little bit more precisely.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So we obviously expect very strong free cash flow growth for the full year, double digit free cash flow growth for full year 2016, which will put us well on track for our $2.4 billion free cash flow in 2017. Obviously, the 51% growth in free cash flow won't continue at exactly that pace, because we did have in Q2 2015 the $137 million cash outflow related to legal settlements. But we do expect very strong free cash flow growth and much stronger cash flow in absolute dollars in the second half of the year aligned with the revenue and operating income growth for the company.
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: We are really seeing, as we've talked before, is our intention is to grow organically, improve margins and improve earnings per share, but to continue to work to translate our operating income and revenue performance into free cash flow. So that engine, that translation is continuing to become disproportionally stronger and that's exactly what you are seeing here, which is why we have been able to achieve the free cash flow performance in the first half, which is on top of record free cash flow performance in 2015.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks for the questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question from Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks.
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Hey, Adam.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Couple of questions around the HR BPO. One, have you continued to have some major wins there? Two, any success moving over to the financials? And then three, I think I heard that and I thought that business is a little tilted towards the fourth quarter, is that right?
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: That's exactly right on the trend line in terms of the disproportionally skewed more toward the fourth quarter, and this is exactly what we're trying to highlight on the call today. We love the progress though here. The team has just done a terrific job, not only in the translation of what we do with our cloud-based businesses on the HR side, but also what we're doing on the finance side. And you can see that evolution starting in HR, moving to finance and eventually connecting the two back which is really where the opportunity is. And from our standpoint, our pipeline is literally sold out in this category. The team has just done a terrific job.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. So you have had some wins on the finance side?
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: We have actually made real progress on the finance side. And I would say that the speakers on the phone today are quite engaged in that and are excited about that for Aon as well. So we're putting our money where our mouth is as we always do and are very excited about what we're going to achieve in this, not only for us and the opportunities there, but also globally in terms of what we've got going on. So we're very excited about the possibilities here.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, as far as Univers acquisition, looks like they do engagement and enrollment. Clearly those were the things that you already did. What does this add? Does it help you attack a different market segment?
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: This is terrific. This is a great example of when we take businesses we've done very, very well in, add content and capability and are able to scale that. So Univers brings – really, this is an elective benefits enrollment and communications firm, as you've highlighted and we highlighted. They bring it into the middle market and across the U.S. and have just an incredibly strong client base. We're going to be able to engage that client base with a broader set of products and services we provide but also take their capability to our client base as well. So we're very excited about this. This is a great example of, as we've described, tuck-in acquisitions in which we can take content and amplify content, and that's exactly what this is about.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: And have you said what range of revenue they bring in?
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: We haven't talked about that, no.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thank you and good morning.
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Hi, Kai.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So the first question is on Brexit. Can you elaborate a little bit on that, what's the near-term as well as what's the long-term impact?
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Kai, I would say – maybe I'll divide the Brexit question into two parts. One is just for our clients, and that's really the lens, as you know, that we look through – we look through everything out in the world through the lens of our clients. And obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty, our clients are going through a lot of questions, both in the region, but also globally, in terms of what the impact is going to be, and we're very vigilant. We spend a great deal of time with our clients on the tradeoffs and issues and areas that they are trying to address in the context of it. And you watch that evolve like we do. And we think there will continue to be uncertainty. As it relates to Aon, the second part, for us, Brexit, like all things that involve client uncertainty, it's an opportunity to help clients understand the situation and take actions to improve their positions. And Brexit has proven to be just that for us, both on the HR Solutions side as well as on the risk side. So from a financial impact from our standpoint, this is really an opportunity to help and support clients. And as I said before, they are facing a lot of uncertainty and we want to help them address that.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Are there any sort of near-term...
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Kai, just in terms of the financial impacts, I guess what I would say is overall the biggest impact for us is on currency. And so a weaker pound is best for us because we do have about $350 million to $400 million of U.S. denominated revenue into the Lloyd's marketplace in the UK. And so a weaker pound actually helps us. There's an offsetting impact in the consulting business that is negative, but net-net it's a benefit. And the only other impact I think I did previously address was interest rates. I think we've had a number of questions from people on interest rates and the impact of that on our pensions and I said it's immaterial.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Have you seen any sort of deferred project related to Brexit?
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Listen, again, there is a range of client reactions. Some clients are deferring and trying to understand and get greater clarity. We're helping them to do that. Other clients are engaging us to actually understand the situation and figure out where there might be opportunity for them as they think about Brexit. So, net-net from our standpoint, again, in times of uncertainty, it's a time to help clients succeed, and that's actually been a benefit as we've engaged them to do that.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then on the Risk Solutions side, you mentioned the pattern shift in terms of revenue from third quarter to fourth quarter and also the compensation shifting backwards from fourth quarter to third quarter. Could you provide a little bit more detail context to that? And also, will these be the same pattern going forward?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So the first answer is yes, it will be the same pattern going forward. And one of the reasons for this is we are seeing client buying behavior shift their buying patterns from Q3 to Q4 in risk to really align around budgeting for the calendar year. And so, we do expect that client buying trend to continue. And then this shift in underlying compensation expenses from Q4 into Q3 we would expect to be a permanent shift too, yes.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And lastly, on tax rate, it had been consistently lower than our expectations. So I just wonder, is that run rate for the last like six months would be a good one going forward?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. We do expect that the correct ongoing tax rate for the company is 19%. We did see some positive discrete tax adjustments again in the quarter, really around state audits. It is actually impossible to predict discrete tax adjustments; they could be positive or negative. And so, 19% is the right operating rate for the company.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you so much for all the answers.
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Thanks, Kai.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning and thank you. I guess the first question, Greg, I was hoping you could help me understand a little bit on the Americas organic growth and reconciling your commentary that U.S. has had record new business. I guess, when I think of record new business in the U.S., it would seem that's the larger portion of that and I would have thought that that would be higher, just given that commentary.
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Yeah. What I was really talking about – first of all, just to be clear, the U.S. did have record new business, actually it was a $100 million-plus quarter, the first time we've ever done $100 million in Q2. So, it was really a terrific testament to the team with very strong retention. A lot of things go into that, rollover, et cetera. But remember, Q2 is one quarter and it tends to be among our smallest quarters, Q2 and Q3. And from our standpoint, as we look at the overall trend line for the year, what I was describing is really the opportunities for the year, and that's really how we look at those, and highlighted what we see in the pipeline for the opportunities in the second half for U.S. Retail and really for risk overall. And then we skew, as Christa just described, I think very well, why the fourth quarter is higher or stronger than the rest of our quarters.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And Aon Inpoint, could you give us some idea on what the size or scale of this business is currently and what the expectation of that business could be going forward?
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Yeah, well, we've talked about – Aon Inpoint is just a great example. When you think about growth for Aon overall, as we've highlighted on previous calls, we've got all the work we do on the traditional side of the business and putting in place things like Aon Client Promise and really substantially increasing our ability to acquire clients, retain clients, and do more with clients. We've also talked about some of the other areas of investment outside of the traditional areas, and we highlighted a couple on the last call. There are $1 billion-plus businesses in Affinity and Health & Benefits that are growing substantially. And then Aon Inpoint is another example really outside the core in which we've made substantial investment. And Aon Inpoint really is bringing together what is a very unique and the single biggest repository of insurance information that exists in the world today and pulling it together on behalf of our clients. And in this case, they happen to be insurance carriers. We've got 45-plus carriers who are involved right now, and we're helping them think about how they improve their business, grow their business overall. We haven't talked about the size, but what I would say is, this is a very – been very positive for us in terms of supporting carriers, strengthening overall position. And it's another example of how we've used data and analytics as a core and cornerstone piece of what we do. And so, for us, it's just another example of where we're investing to grow the business. By the way, not only do we have Aon Inpoint, now we also have something called Aon Review, which is doing the same thing on the reinsurance side. We've actually taken the data and analytics approach that really underpins Aon Inpoint and used it as part of our U.S. mortgage effort, that's, by the way, reached $5 billion-plus in premium since its inception, which is a great accomplishment. And then things like Aon Client Treaty. These are fundamentally data-driven, analytic-driven businesses that we see a lot of promise for.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. And lastly, I guess, Christa, could you help me out with one thing on the cash flow, and I'm trying to work through understanding the improvement from cash flow from improvements in working capital on the accounts receivable and payable that you've mentioned and how this is net new cash flow, as opposed to accounting timing, if I think pulling receivables from calendar year 2018 into 2017 or 2017 into 2016, or is it actually net new in some manner and how would that be actual net new dollars?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So I guess one way to think about it on the receivables side is if you've got a dollar of revenue today and it takes you 100 days to collect it, then you're tying up a lot of cash on your balance sheet in the form of receivables. And if we get the 100 days, for argument's sake, down to 50 days, then you've halved the amount of cash that you're tying up on your balance sheet in the form of receivables. And what you can see if you divide receivables by revenue on our balance sheet, is that days' sales outstanding has come down substantially. And so it's taking us less time to collect cash from customers. And so we are getting more in line with what we think a professional services firm should be, which is working capital neutral. And today if you looked at our days payables and our days sales outstanding, there is a 15-day negative gap, and we believe that should be neutral. And the difference between that is the extra $500 million of free cash flow I mentioned. So we think there is a substantial opportunity to continue to improve working capital and generate substantial free cash flow over the coming years.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Is there a cost to that 15-day net? I mean, in a low interest rate environment like we're in today, what's the cost of that spread?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, it's not. There is no cost.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's just processing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Quentin McMillan with KBW. Please go ahead.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to talk about the divestitures really quickly. You had a decrease in expenses for the divestitures, but the overall kind of divestiture strategy, particularly as it relates to HR Solutions, as you drive towards your 22% long-term margin target, do you need to divest some of the lower return businesses in order to achieve that in HR, or are you happy with the current portfolio and it's just improvement in those businesses?
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Yeah. There's no divestiture strategy. There's a return on invested capital strategy and a client strategy that drives everything we do. And we continue – we've made unprecedented investments back into the HR Solutions business and the risk business. We're going to continue to do that, look for us to do that, with the organic investments we've made and then acquisitions that strengthen our position to serve clients more effectively. And then from time to time as we look at that overall portfolio, we will make calls and decision that will help us both improve client serving capability, absolutely fundamental, and then also improve return on invested capital. And you'll see us do that just in the natural course. And if you think about over the last 10 years, it hasn't just been in HR Solutions, it's across Risk Solutions, probably even more pronounced in Risk Solutions, where we have transitioned out assets that weren't strengthening our client serving capability as much and brought new assets and it helps us do that.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. And just a quick numbers question, Christa. Thanks for the $500 million of working capital improvement that you mentioned, but is that through 2017 or is that a number that you're talking about in a longer term?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That is a very long-term number.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And then one last quick thing on the Americas retail growth. If you're saying that there was $100 million of new business, a record number in the quarter, Latin America is included in your Americas retail, I believe. Does that indicate that LatAm was kind of particularly weak in the quarter or don't read into it that way?
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: No, really don't read into it. Look, the real message cutting across the entire call is the first six months of 2016 have just been a continuation, a reinforcement of everything we expected coming into the year, nothing's really thrown us off from that at all. Some up, some down, but overall what we're seeing is growth across the globe and we fully expect to see that for the year, and we fully expect Latin America is going to be a big contributor to that as they've been for the last number of years.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Just a quick one on the benefits administration business. I guess there's been some revenue pressure there. I'm wondering what's happening there, and should we expect that to improve or is this going to be permanently relatively subdued?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We love the benefits administration business. We serve 22 million Americans across our retirement and health portfolios there, and we continue to invest in the technology to serve clients and develop unique solutions. So, we expect to continue to grow in that business. We did have some anticipated losses coming into the year. Clients were in a sort of M&A (44:51) environment and were acquired, and we do expect to grow overall.
Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, there are no additional questions in queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Just want to say thanks very much, everybody, for joining the call, and look forward to the next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. And that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature, as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2016 results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter of 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. And consistent with previous quarters I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. And second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to slide 3. In the first quarter organic revenue growth was 3% with growth across every major business, highlighted by 4% growth in each of our retail brokerage businesses and positive organic growth in Reinsurance. Operating margin increased 20 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS decreased 1% to $1.35, including a $0.10 unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency. And finally, free cash flow was $221 million, reflecting solid underlying performance in our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter. Overall, our first quarter results reflect the strength of our industry leading franchise and a solid start to the year. With organic revenue growth across every major business, adjusted operating margin expansion, improved return on invested capital, and effective allocation of capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $750 million of stock. Turning to slide 4. On the second topic of growth and investment I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening the underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long term growth and improved operating leverage. With management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across retail brokerage, highlighted by record retention levels of nearly 94% in U.S. Retail and EMEA. New business generation of $225 million across retail brokerage, including record new business in U.S. Retail. Twenty consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty Reinsurance. An increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, which captures over 3 million trades and $160 billion of bound premium. ReView, our reinsurer dashboard combined with strategic consulting to help reinsurers to be more effective capital markets for seeing company clients. And our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk. A great example of our innovation in data and analytics was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's. Since launching on January 1 we remain very excited about the positive impact of the Client Treaty for our largest and most sophisticated clients. We've had terrific success in feedback from clients around the world. And continue to attract new clients with the Client Treaty being a major differentiator. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4%, similar to the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact on pricing was negative, resulted in a relatively stable market impact overall, similar to the last six quarters. We saw double-digit growth in Latin America, driven by management of the renewable book portfolio with many regions delivering strong growth, despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region. In U.S. Retail growth was driven by solid retention rates and continued record new business generation, led by a diverse portfolio of products, including health, P&C, and surety. Affinity also recorded solid performance, highlighted by strong growth in the consumer solutions. In International organic revenue growth was 4%, compared to 3% in the prior-year quarter. Similar to the last six quarters exposures continue to be stable. And the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region. Results reflect strong growth in Asia, including strength in Health and Benefits and strong management of the renewal book portfolio. In Continental Europe we saw solid growth, driven by both new business generation and management of the renewal book portfolio, reflecting strong leadership across the region, as the macroeconomic environment continues to stabilize. And in the Pacific we saw continued strength in New Zealand, while Australia showed modest growth. In Reinsurance organic revenue growth was 1%, compared to negative 1% in the prior year quarter, reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, cedent demand in treaty, and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by unfavorable market impact. As the rate of price decline continues to moderate, capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk, and other emerging risks, such as cyber liability. And as highlighted in our prior discussions, new opportunities for growth, combined with industry leading data analytics, has positioned our Reinsurance business for a return to modest growth in 2016. Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 2% with growth across both businesses. We're seeing growth in high demand areas, where we have strategically invested in innovative solutions and clients serving capabilities, reflecting Aon Hewitt's leadership and in depth understanding of market trends. Including as clients manage risk against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded, and facing regulatory changes; solutions to de-risk pensions plans; and support for delegated investment solutions, a strong growth area, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in 5 years. Continued investment to strengthen our industry leading portfolio of health solutions, covering a full range of benefit strategies, client size, and funding choices, including our suite of private health care exchanges. We're also investing in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in our Talent and Rewards business, as we're seeing strong demand for data and analytics to support increasing organizational change. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services organic revenue growth was 3%, compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services. We also saw growth in core pension solutions, where we provide clients the best combination of expertise and execution. And modest growth in communications consulting. In Outsourcing organic revenue growth was 1%, compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included certain out of cycle follow-on enrollments on our Retiree Exchange related to a very large client implementation. Results excluding the follow-on enrollments in the prior year reflect strong growth in HR BPO driven by new client wins in cloud based solutions. In summary, we delivered solid organic growth across every major business and strengthened our operational performance, driven by our industry leading platform of client serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics. With that said I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year. We delivered organic revenue growth across both segments and delivered strong operating margin improvement in Risk Solutions. We improved return on invested capital through the disposition of certain businesses and effectively allocated capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $750 million of ordinary shares in the quarter, more share repurchase than we've done in any quarter since 2008. Strong share repurchase, coupled with the recent announcement of a 10% increase to the quarterly cash dividend, reflects our long term belief in the strengthening free cash flow of the firm. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, decreased 1% to $1.35 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.37 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization. As we noted at the beginning of the call we evaluate performance over the course of the year as macro factors or certain actions to strengthen underlying performance may distort results on a near term basis. To help put the first quarter underlying EPS in context, first we incurred unfavorable foreign currency related impacts totaling $0.10 per share, including $0.05 per share of translation for a stronger U.S. dollar and $0.05 per share for remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, primarily resulting from significant devaluation of the exchange rate in Venezuela. Going forward, if currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an immaterial impact for the rest of the year. Second, we took steps to further strengthen return on invested capital with the disposition of certain businesses. In HR Solutions we incurred $0.06 per share of transaction and portfolio repositioning related costs in connection with dispositions. These costs were more than offset by $0.10 per share of gains recorded in other income. Lastly, the prior year quarter benefited from $0.12 per share of other income gains. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 24.2% and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $13 million unfavorable impact from FX. Excluding this impact underlying operating income increased 6% versus the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 100 basis points includes a 30-basis-point favorable impact from FX. Excluding the impact from FX, underlying operating margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter. Strong operating improvement in the first quarter reflects organic growth in each business, including Reinsurance, and improved return on our investments in data and analytics across the portfolio. We continued to face certain headwinds in the first quarter from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance and weaker economic conditions in a number of geographies. Despite these challenges our performance in Risk Solutions reflects strong new business generation and increased operating leverage in the business. We expect continued growth and operational improvement throughout 2016 as we make progress towards our long term operating margin target of 26%. In addition, if short term interest rates continue to rise, we believe we have significant leverage to an improving interest rate environment, as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income. Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 2%. Operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 11.8%. And operating income decreased 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Results were exactly in line with our previously provided guidance. Operating income included a $3 million unfavorable impact from FX. As mentioned previously, underlying results in the quarter included $20 million, or minus 220 basis points, of transaction and portfolio repositioning related costs as we continue to drive improved return on capital for the firm. The gain relating to the sale of our Recruitment Process Outsourcing business was recorded in other income. Strong underlying operating performance was driven by organic revenue growth in high demand areas where we've been investing as well as expense discipline and return on our investments. Looking forward, we expect continued growth in revenue, operating income, and margin in 2016 towards our long term target of 22%, with quarterly patterning of operating income results in HR Solutions similar to 2015. More specifically, operating income will be down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, most notably in Q4. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $46 million compared to $47 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $2 million compared to $3 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $4 million to $69 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $18 million primarily includes gains on the sale of certain businesses partially offset by losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense and $3 million per quarter of interest income. Interest expense in the second quarter is expected to be approximately $72 million or modestly higher than the first quarter due to the overlap of $750 million of notes placed in February and $500 million of notes due in May. We currently expect interest expense to decline to $70 million per quarter thereafter. Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations decreased to 18.4% compared to the prior year quarter at 19.1% due to the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 273.7 million in the first quarter, compared to 287.1 million in the prior year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital and manage dilution. The company repurchased 7.7 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $750 million in the first quarter. The company has $3.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on March 31 were 264.8 million. And there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 270 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance, and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At March 31, 2016, cash and short term investments were $1.1 billion. We expect levels to return to our normal run rate between $600 million to $800 million in the second quarter. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.6 billion. And total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.7 times. Cash flow from operations for the first 3 months decreased 8% or $25 million to $273 million. This was primarily driven by unfavorable timing of certain tax related items that we expect to normalize by Q2, partially offset by working capital improvements and a decline in cash paid for pensions and restructuring. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, decreased 6% or $15 million to $221 million, reflecting a decline in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $10 million decrease in CapEx. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal, as further long term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. The third is declining uses of cash for pension, CapEx, and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of the 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Turning to our pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability, as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits, and continue to derisk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect non-cash pension income to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015. Regarding our restructuring program. As all charges related to restructuring program have been incurred, we expect cash payments to decline by $9 million to approximately $19 million in 2016. And continue to decline thereafter to an immaterial amount. In summary we delivered solid underlying results in the first quarter. Investments in our industry leading platform of client serving capabilities across risk, retirement, and health continue to position the firm for long term revenue growth, further margin expansion, and strong free cash flow generation towards our near term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. With that I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And now our first question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. You may now ask your question.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Sarah.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of the broader macro environment and your confidence in your ability to grow in both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions in the face of a softening P&C market and somewhat choppy economy.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Let me just reflect and take a step back a little bit, Sarah. We feel very – candidly, very good about continued progress. You saw it. And you've seen us grow in each of the last number of years. But if you think about our confidence both in the current environment for the coming years – by the way, not just grow the business but also improve margins, tracking toward our 26% and 22% goals in Risk and in HR Solutions. And I would just say, listen, just as an example. This often gets linked back into the pricing on the insurance side. And we would encourage you to separate those and just consider – think about from Aon's standpoint, three sources of growth. And just thinking on the Risk side for a moment. Our ability to grow in the traditional business, property/casualty, D&O, all those pieces reflects a multiyear investment in something we called Aon Client Promise. This is really helping us bring more new clients into the fray and do more with the existing clients. And as proof points for that set of – that roll out – by that way, that's also across HR Solutions as well. Look at new business in Q1. It was a record in U.S. Retail. It was a record worldwide. By the way, that's a record on top of a record. It was the same in Q1 in 2015 with record levels of retention. So this is just 94% in U.S. Retail, for example, and EMEA. So these are just examples of sort of what's happening in the core business and what we're about. And we would say, by the way, as an aside, the market overall as we look at it is a bit frankly more – a bit more stable when you think about pricing and insured values. But that's just one aspect of Aon. Another aspect is our ability to grow outside the traditional core. And think about in this regard just a couple of examples here. We got two existing $1 billion revenue businesses we've invested in heavily. Affinity being one, $1 billion business growing exceptionally well. Health and Benefits, $1 billion business plus, also growing just proportionately well. So you've got the traditional. You've got these things outside the core I just described. And then equally exciting for us is the ability to grow in new areas, where we've made substantial investment. And just a few examples of those would be like Aon Client Treaty, I highlighted the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk for Lloyd's. Aon InPoint, 40 plus carriers on that platform now. And ReView. And then finally I would just highlight what we just did in U.S. mortgage over the last couple of years has frankly brought insurance capital into the mortgage market. And in 2015 alone I think that's about $3.5 billion in net new premium, $5 billion since inception. So the point being here, Sarah, this is such an important question. We believe we continue to prove the point that organic growth and margin improvement for us is not about insurance pricing or market impact. It's really about our ability to continue to invest and bring market – bringing into the market capabilities and real products that help our clients succeed. And frankly, that engine is under our control. It's working. And it's continuing to build. And a lot of the things we've invested in historically are just coming online. And you saw it also in the momentum as we finished 2015. In 2015 we grew organically, had record margins in Risk, record margins in HR Solutions, record free cash flow, and record EPS. That momentum in 2015 carries us into 2016. And it really is that engine that's driving it. So does that answer your question around growth?
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. That's great. Very thorough. And then secondly, there were recent new inversion rules, which propose essentially limiting the amount of inter-company debt. Could you just talk about what the implications for this could be for Aon and as well as your tax rate?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So I think there were two primary sets of proposed regulation published by the U.S. Treasury. The first proposed regulation applies to inversion transactions, and therefore does not apply to us. We completed our redomicile over 4 years ago. It was signed off by the IRS in September 2013. And following our redomicile our capital structure looks like any other foreign based company in a territorial tax system. The second proposed regulation applies to inter-company debt placed after April 4, 2016. Our inter-company debt was placed prior to April 4 and would also not apply to Aon's current global capital structure. The majority of our existing inter-company debt will come due on 2023 and after. Overall, we feel really comfortable with our current effective tax rate for the foreseeable future.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And I know it's a ways away but what would happen in 2023?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I mean the way we think about this, Sarah, is we have an overall capital structure. And we use inter-company debt as one part of that to help drive investments globally. But there are many other factors that influence that. As a U.K. company we operate in territorial tax system, which has different repatriation impacts than a worldwide tax system. We're growing in geographies with declining statutory tax rates, such as the U.K., where we're domiciled, where the tax rate is currently 20%. And it's going to decline over the coming years to 17%. And so statutory tax rates are a really important part of the business decision for where we invest and build new products and services. And we also leverage net operating losses where possible to decide where we invest and grow businesses. So I guess what I would say is, as we think about our business going forward, our overall global capital structure we feel is appropriate for our business. And therefore, we feel really comfortable with our current effective tax rate for the foreseeable future.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Styblo of Jefferies. You may now ask your question.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. The follow-up on Sarah's, I certainly appreciate the macro comments and the new areas of growth. That's I'm sure attributing to the stronger growth in Retail I suspect with the 4% up there. But I'm also wondering, more on the core side, and we've seen of couple of your peers post slower growth than that. And actually talk about some sluggishness in the EU. Of course the pricing pressures and so forth and just overall tempering of growth. So I'm curious if you're just in areas or markets that are not seeing that? Or if you're perhaps gaining some share from peers? What's sort of your assessment more on the core part of the business?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: We can step back, David, and essentially say, look – and I described three areas around – the traditional, sort of areas outside the traditional, and then areas related to some of the data and analytics efforts we've made around investments. And we're seeing growth in all three areas. Frankly, we saw growth. And we're in all the countries. So we're in 120 countries around the world. It's the most comprehensive platform out there. And we saw growth in EMEA, in Germany, in France, in Italy. We – note the retention rates I described before and the new business generation. So while they're – while the market conditions we think remain relatively stable – and again we would say on balance, when you think about pricing and insured values, put those two together and call those market impact. Often times you hear about pricing, you don't hear about market impact. Market impact has as much impact as pricing. On balance we actually think 2016 looks than better than 2015 for our global footprint. But you saw growth across EMEA and the countries I just highlighted. You're seeing new business generation. This is in the core business, net new business generation in the U.S. and in EMEA that is literally record levels in Q1. And it was record on top of record. So the comps are extremely, extremely high. And record new retention rates that – approaching 94%, 95%. So for us, look, we're going to keep investing around how we – in client leadership how we actually bring new clients in and how we serve them. And serve them more comprehensively. And that's the engine we have control over. And that's the engine that's working both in a traditional side, very much the traditional side, as well as the areas like Affinity and Health and Benefits, as well as the net new areas we're investing in beyond that.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Very good. If I can move over to the HR side, the Solutions side there, and just dig into a little bit more of the Outsourcing. That was a little bit more of a standout being particularly soft and it was sort of similar to a prior year. But can you tell us more about the puts and takes there, the retention, the business activity? And then as it relates to sort of the margins in the segment and earnings, I know you said it was consistent with what you were looking for, but a little bit steeper than I guess what we had expected or I had at least expected from the outside. Does any part of – did you expect the repositioning costs and so forth to happen when you originally set guidance? Or is this something sort of new?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I would start – let me just start a little bit of top line growth overall and then Christa can give a little background on some of the – on details around the margin opportunities here. First, we would say our first quarter performance in Outsourcing is exactly consistent with what we left the year with in 2015. And our expectations for 2016 are exactly in line with what we had expected them to be. So there has really not been a change. There's a bit of noise in the quarter, which we could describe, but it's exactly the same. By the way, if we just think about Outsourcing growth overall and go back to 2013, 2014, and 2015. 2013 is 1%; 2014 is 1%; 2015 is 4%; 2016, it's back to 1%. It's 4% in 2015 because we were very fortunate to support a very, very, very large client on a Retiree Exchange opportunity. And that actually skewed 2015. Absent that, the trajectory looks exactly the same. And from a growth standpoint for the year, we feel very, very good about what we're able to do. In particular, some of the things we're doing with cloud based applications, which has just been exceptionally strong underlying growth and a stronger pipeline. So top line growth, we feel very good about where we are, how we started the quarter, and no change in expectations for 2016.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And then in terms of your question around did we expect the charges in reconstructing we took in this quarter. Absolutely. We've really been very focused on return on capital for a number of years now as you know. And we gave guidance in Q4 that we would grow revenue, operating income, and margin for the full year 2016 in HR Solutions. And we're absolutely going to do that. And we also gave guidance that operating income would pattern similar to 2015 with operating income down in the first half, up in the second half, and up particularly in Q4. And really what you observe in Q1 is us continuing to improve return on capital as we manage our portfolio. And we did exit the Recruitment Process Outsourcing business. And you can see the gain of $0.10 in the other income line. And then transaction and deal related costs in the HR operating income line of $0.06 or $20 million. And that really had a minus 220 basis point impact on margin in the quarter. Ex that, you can see that the HR Solutions margin in the quarter would have been 14%. So you can see the underlying improvement in margin in our business as we continue to focus on return on capital and drive revenue, operating income, and margin growth for the full year 2016.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: That's great. And then just one final one on the treasury to come back to the inter-company debt aspect in 2023. So it's my understanding that there's nothing wrong with having inter-company debt. It's just the matter in which it's being used to support the business. Is that something you guys, one, agree with? And number two, is there any way to quantify how much debt you have and to give us a sense of is there any of that that might be at risk that might not be categorized the way it is as debt right now?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We would say that we're going to continue to invest in the U.S. And inter-company debt is the way in which it will be enabled. And so we will continue to use inter-company debt to help us invest and grow our U.S. business over the coming years. So absolutely we think it's a core part of the way we run our business. And then we absolutely think about inter-company debt similar to third party debt. We manage it in terms of coverage and leverage ratios as you would expect. And we really have a global capital structure that looks like any other foreign based company in a territorial tax system. So we think that our global capital structure is appropriate for our company. And we feel really comfortable with our current effective tax rate for the foreseeable future.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Quentin McMillan of KBW. You may now ask your question.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Quentin, you may be on mute.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Sorry about that. Thank you so much. Greg, you called out particular strength in the Health business in your prepared comments. And I just wanted to sort of drill into the Health and Benefit segment a little bit more specifically. I think you said it's sort of a $1 billion business now. Can you give us a little bit more color on in terms of if that's growing at an organic clip sort of above or in line with what the rest of your brokerage segment is? Maybe what the profitability is? And sort of how you guys view it currently and going forward?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I would just literally – what I just was trying to highlight a little bit was just when you think about some of the investments we're making outside of some of the retail brokerage pieces, as Sarah was highlighting, that's one example. That just happens to be Health and Benefits. What we're very excited about, Quentin, is the overall Health category. And this is a category we've been investing in substantially for a number of years. And you're seeing that literally on the Health and Benefits side, which is a $1 billion plus business, growing exceptionally well. But you also see it on what we're doing on the exchange side, a whole range of health solutions. We administer benefits for 22 million plus Americans, 11 million of which is really on the Health side. And for us we see this category as one of the primary areas of investment for Aon over time. And it's been exceptionally positive really across the board.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thank you so much. And then secondly, Christa, if I could just ask a question in terms of the share repurchase. Obviously you guys have been very clear that you believe share repurchase is the best and highest return use of capital. But is there a way for us to sort of get a better understanding in terms of how you look at the return metrics on share repo versus M&A versus investment in the business? Maybe just what's most important to you? And if you can give us any kind of color or clarity in terms of what the level of return might be in one versus the other?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So we have been very clear that we manage this in terms of return on capital. The way we measure the return on capital is on a cash-on-cash metric. And as we think about sort of share repurchase and the return that that generates, we have a discounted cash flow view of Aon over time. And it is a very conservative view of the company, because we've beaten our own cash flow forecast in each of the last 5 years. So this kind of cash flow really is the value highlighted by the $2.4 billion in free cash flow we'll generate in 2017. And then future growth in cash from there onwards. And we do absolutely trade off investment in share repurchase, M&A, organic investment, pension, et cetera. And so that's how we think about it. And in terms of Q1 we did take advantage of a lower share price in the quarter to do the largest amount of share repurchase we've done, $750 million, since 2008.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. And I just – one of the parts that I wanted to sort of touch upon in that – and I apologize for not asking it more clearly – is just the divestiture you had in the business as well. Sort of the overall return you have. That you mentioned improved the return on invested capital. Is there sort of other businesses that might be dragging that down? And are you sort of looking to optimize the entire portfolio that way? Or are – do you feel good about where everything sits currently?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I mean you should think over the coming years that we're going to continue to manage our business on a return on capital basis. We'll continue to invest in the highest return on capital areas. We'll continue to divest or invest less in the lowest return areas. So we're going to continue to manage this portfolio over time. And I wouldn't note that it – I'd note that it's happening across the firm. We had a small divestiture in our Retail Brokerage business in the first quarter too. And so you should just think about us continuing to manage the portfolio and to continue the drive return on invested capital across the entire business.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks so much for the time.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you so much. It's just a follow-up of Quentin's question, buybacks. So it looks like $750 million, a very strong number especially for seasonally weak in the first quarter. I just wonder, does it alter the pace of your buybacks throughout the year? And also could – if could you talk a little bit more about the source of funding for buybacks? Because – in related to last 2 year, pretty strong, like $2.3 billion in 2014 and $1.6 billion in 2015.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, Kai, if we think about buyback, we've absolutely described it as the highest return on capital use of cash we have today. And therefore, as you think about the sources of cash that can contribute to buyback, it's really about the strong free cash flow growth we're generating from the business each year. And then as we think about leverage, we really think about our current investment grade rating as incredibly important to us and staying within our existing debt-to-EBITDA ratio. But as EBITDA and free cash flow grows, it really creates an opportunity for us to add additional leverage. And so there are the two sources, free cash flow from operations plus additional leverage as our cash flow and EBITDA grows over time. And as we think about the balance of the year, we're not really giving specific guidance, Kai. But really what I would say is, as you think about the cash we generate over any year, we're going to manage the investment of that cash based on return on capital.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Then just follow up at the leverage. If the 2.7 [times] level is the optimum level you want to maintain? Or there you want to work it down? Or you can even lever up from the current levels?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So as we think about our current investment grade rating, Kai, what we would say is it's really 3 times to 3.5 times on a Moody's basis, which is really how we manage it internally. And if you translate that to a GAAP debt-to-EBITDA basis, it's 2 times to 2.5 times. So it's slightly above the range that we would like to be in an optimal basis.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. That's great. And then for Greg is, could you comment broadly about the recent market dislocation as well? Your commentary about the rising tension between brokers as well as the carriers.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. From our standpoint as we think about where we are in the market, we're not seeing anything unusual about what's gone on over time frankly. We've got a set of market partners who we – who are incredibly important to us, because they're important to our clients. And our focus every day is really maniacally around how we bring solutions to clients to help drive their business. And candidly, the market partners are central to that. Absolutely critical. So we find ourselves actually working more and more with market partners in ways to sort of come up with new and innovative solutions. And it's really been great. I mean one of the things we just spent time talking about, something we call Carrier Link, which is actually enabling us to bring our global capability or global demand to carriers around the world. Carrier Link for example for Lloyd's but for other carriers as well to actually make it more electronic, to actually make it more efficient. So for us we see our market partners as extremely central. And just want to continue to reinforce and foster those relationships on behalf of our clients.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. If I may last one is that is there any better way for us to model the other income line?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I mean I would say it is inherently on an underlying basis flat. I think it has been very lumpy, based on sort of the return on capital moves we've been making around some portfolio repositioning. But we ourselves, when we budget internally, budget it at $0.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee CRT. You may now ask your question.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Hi. Good morning. So, the first question is on the Consulting segment. Christa, you mentioned that the margins were 14%. So just wanted to reconfirm that that's the right base for the future. Is the 14% margin the right base? And also surprised that margins increased about 80 basis points, when organic growth 22%. So can you help me on that please?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So if you exclude the one-time charges of $20 million in Q1, then 14% Q1 HR Solutions margin is the right underlying margin for the business. That is absolutely right. And then what I would say is we've been investing a lot in that business. We've been investing in our delegated investments business, which is growing fantastically. We've now got $85 billion in assets under management. We've been investing a lot in our BPO SaaS business, which is growing fantastically. We're winning substantial deals. And the pipeline there is fantastic. And we're investing a lot in our Talent business. We just bought a business called Modern Survey during the first quarter, and it's fantastic. So we're feeling really good about the investments we've made in this business. And really what you're observing is the return on those investments.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: One of the – look, of I'd add today as well. As you think about these investments drive top line, as Christa has just described. But they also in many respects – not all – but in many respects inject a level of operating leverage into the business that's actually quite powerful. So we're growing top line. But we're also able to improve margin at lesser levels of growth, if you see where I'm coming from. And by the way, you see that in Risk Solutions and you see that in HR Solutions both. So these investments we've been making over time that are beginning to – you're beginning to see show up have both pieces in the context of that. So it really is an investment at scale, if you will, in terms of sort of making a difference across Aon.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: That's very helpful. And the sale of the piece of the business in that segment had a 7% I guess negative impact on the top line this quarter. Should we expect a similar level for the next few quarters? And part of the guidance I believe was that you would grow your total revenue. So is it the growth even after the sale of the segment?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We will continue to grow even after the sale of the segment, yes. And one of the things that I would observe that you saw in Q1 2016 as Greg described is we had an unusually strong comparable in Q1 2015 with the enrollments and the Retiree Exchange of one of our largest clients. But I think what you're seeing in the column – I guess it's page 11 of the earnings release – that minus 7%, is really two things going on. It's the exit of the business in Q1 2015, where we exited a business in our payroll segment. And then the business that we also exited in Q4 2015. So there's a number of different components going into this. So it isn't one business.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: But you will see us over time, Vinay, grow this business organically as we described before. And this will strengthen our ability. We believe this will strengthen our ability to grow organically. And you will see that play out over the coming quarters.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Sure. Fair enough. And just one follow-up on the capital management. Sorry to beat this to death, but the way that I understand that is that just the free cash flow minus the amount you spend on dividends and M&A. So what number are you looking at in terms of M&A for this year already? And also the debt increase, my estimate is that you're going to be up by around $250 million net debt this year. Just wondering if that number makes sense.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So we're not going to give specific guidance around M&A in any particular year. Because the way we run the process is really around managing return on capital every week and every month to optimize our investments organically, investments in M&A, investments in share repurchase, et cetera. And so we actually – while we intend to spend certain amounts on M&A in a year, it's going to end up being a different number than – depending on what the actual opportunities and the returns on those opportunities are. And then in terms of your debt question, it's really around, as you think about that ratio, 2 times to 2.5 times debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis, that's really how we think about managing the company. And so that's the right leverage level for us going forward.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. You may now ask your question.
Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Yes. Thank you. Just a quick one. Greg, can you talk about potential implications of Brexit for you guys?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Operator, you just broke – oh. Yeah. Sorry about that. Got it. Brexit. Listen, step back overall. It's obviously a topic of conversation now daily with clients around the world. Obviously as you get into Europe and the U.K., more frequently than that. As we think about – and we really think about this, Brian, first and foremost for our clients. And we see there's lots of ways it could – that if it ends up happening that it could impact them and their operations of their businesses over time. And that's really what we're most vigilant on. For Aon we actually feel very comfortable. We'll help them manage through it if they have to endure that. And if not, we feel comfortable with that as well. So there's not as much impact on Aon overall. But from our standpoint feel that there is a set of opportunities here that come out of disruption, if that's the case, and there's a set of items we're going to help our clients to address it. But for us it really – that's how we'd shape it out.
Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And, Brian, the other thing we'd say is any time there's a regulatory change, it means you've got to help clients through that. And so helping clients navigate business interruption insurance, when you've got to separate out the U.K. from Continental Europe, or pension plans, which across EMEA and you've got to separate them out. There's a lot of activity that would be generated for us. And the other thing I would say is we have substantial business in the U.K., where we have the U.S. dollar revenue and a pound expense base. And so to the extent that the pound becomes weaker because of this, it actually benefits us.
Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. That's helpful. And then last question. I wonder if you could give us a little bit of a look at what's the pipeline look right now for the Corporate Exchange business.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: We actually feel really good about the continuation of this, Brian, as I said before. First of all, for us, first and foremost, it's really the Health category. Absolutely really like the position we're in and how that's continuing to grow. And on the exchange side our clients continue to experience very, very good results. A large percentage of our clients actually had rate decreases in the last cycle overall. Satisfaction continues to be very high. And the pipeline is very, very strong. We know it takes time for these things to evolve. And you're seeing that play out on the Health Exchange side. But it really is part of an overall Health Solution, which is actually quite, quite strong.
Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for the answers.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. You may now ask your question.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Thank you.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Charles.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just curious, Greg, about growth in the Risk business. And not for this quarter per se, but I guess over the next couple of years. Obviously you guys don't give – expect to give guidance on M&A. And you haven't done much in this space over the last few years, as you had really strong cash flow growth. But if looking forward over the next couple of years, does that math change? The margins on that business have increased incredibly well. A lot of the restructuring and whatnot has been taken out. And you guys have one of the best toolboxes in the industry. Wondering – I guess I just sort of think that the growth in that business should even be better. While 4% organic is really good in this market, I guess I at some level think that the total line of that business would be even more than that and maybe should be over the next few years.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Listen, we agree in terms of sort of overall opportunity. If you step back and think about the journey that Aon has been on as we've shaped and built our firm, we would say this is an unfinished business for us. This is – while we've made great progress, and it's really a credit to my Aon colleagues around the world, the progress they've made over the last number of years, the platform we have and given the current state of the – state of where our clients are with unprecedented risk spacing, traditional and non-traditional. Think about global warming, pandemic, cyber, terrorism, all the different pieces. The challenges on Health, which are unprecedented literally in the U.S. and around the world, the challenges on retirement. These set of issues for us represent what we believe is an incredible set of demands for clients, needs for clients. And our platforms are actually very, very well positioned against these mega, really global needs from a client standpoint. And as I said at the beginning to Sarah's question, the ways we're helping clients are traditional brokerage, all the different pieces around that. There are areas that are outside that, as we continue to evolve and develop. By the way, that's in HR Solutions and in Risk Solutions. And then in areas like data and analytics, which frankly are opening up an entire new vista for us that we've invested in. This is not flavor of the month for us. This has been a 7-year set of investments in which we're investing $300 million, $400 million, $500 million over time around on data and analytics and insight. So for us we see this as a tremendous opportunity. And it's not just top line. It really is around operating performance improvement, which is why again we look at 2016, 2017, 2018 as just a continuation. This is not new news. A continuation of building Aon, strengthening Aon on behalf of clients. And the record shows we're making progress against that with more opportunity to come.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I guess what I was trying to get to is even towards your goals, right, if you look at the long term operating margin in Risk, you're kind of already half the way there, if I look back to when you laid out your cash flow doubling plan in 2012. And as you encroach on that, if I think of 2016 or 2017 cash flow doubling, I guess does the math conceptually change where M&A might become more attractive than share buyback? Because the rapidness of improvement of the core business has been – so much has already been done.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, listen. Again remember back to what Christa described in terms of our overall framework. We have a pretty maniacal framework around return on invested capital. And what I would highlight for you is, while we've done a lot of buyback in the last 10 years, we've also done $7 billion, $8 billion worth of M&A. So we've done a tremendous amount of M&A. We've done a tremendous amount of buyback. And over a 10-year period, we've improved operating income 10% per year over that period of time and grown EPS about 16% per year over that period of time. And so we're going to keep looking at these tradeoffs. And we – as we make our cash flow goal in 2017 of $2.4 billion and continue to build on it, as Christa described, our capacity to invest back in the business organically, M&A, buyback, we have all these at our disposal as we build the firm. And that's why candidly we're very – we're excited about where we are on the journey and what the possibilities are going forward. And we see more possibilities going forward than we do historically in terms of what the opportunities are going to look like.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I appreciate the answers. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you very much. And our last question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. You may now ask your question.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Obviously Sarah had some interesting questions regarding the inter-company debt and the 2023 date. When I look at your balance sheet by I guess company segment, it seems to be that half the debt of the $19 billion facility seems to be in current liabilities and half of it seems to be in long term liabilities. How does that work? And in terms of what you're reading of the new proposals are, will those current liabilities be able to be rolled over for another year?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. But, Josh, as you look at our balance sheet, you can see that we have a normal intercompany trade receivables and payables, as all companies do who operate in more than one country. And it's split into short term and long term. And so that is a normal part of doing business. And as we said earlier to this question, we feel really comfortable with our current effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Because as we think about the new proposed regulations, we're going to continue to invest in the U.S. via inter-company debt, because inter-company debt is permissible under the new proposed regulations.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, and will that – I guess that $9 billion of current liability debt inter-company be able to be rolled over for another year?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Ryan (sic) [Josh], there's a bunch of normal – it's not inter-company debt. That is normal trade receivables and payables.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Inter-company – I guess – so when I look at it, it's hard to say. I actually see the – those $19 billion, I guess it looks like debt. If it's not really debt, how does that work exactly?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So we have normal trade receivables and payables, as you would expect in any global company. And so the majority of that is not inter-company debt.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think the punch line, by the way, if you step back and think about sort of the trades, because we've gotten a few questions here on the balance sheet with more interest than we've ever had before. If you step back and think about the tax rate that I think you're getting back to. And Christa's point that literally we feel very comfortable with where it is. By the way, we feel very comfortable with where it is and for the foreseeable future. That's past 2021, 2022, 2023, so past that time period. So you take all the debt pieces off the table completely and ask, how comfortable are we with our current tax rate? We feel very comfortable with it. It will evolve over time back and forth. But we feel very comfortable. And nothing that's happened the last 6 months or the last 6 weeks has changed that point of view in the least bit. So just – I think that's the governing thoughts. And so you might want to take away from where we are.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, I think that's very reasonable. Thanks, Greg.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you very much. I would now like to the turn call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: I just wanted to say thanks, everybody, for joining today. We really appreciate it. And I appreciate your interest in Aon and look forward to the next call. Thanks very much.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to the Aon Plc Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today and consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is the overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to slide 3. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5% with solid growth across all major businesses, highlighted by 6% growth in each of our retail brokerage businesses. Operating margin increased 110 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in both segments. And EPS increased 20% to $2.27, reflecting strong operating performance and effective capital management. If we turn to the full year, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth across both Risk and HR Solutions despite pricing pressure and overall economic uncertainty. Operating margin increased 50 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance and record margin results in those segments. EPS increased 8% to $6.18, overcoming substantial foreign currency headwinds. And finally, free cash flow increased 10% to a record $1.7 billion. Overall, our results reflect both the strong performance in the quarter and for the full year. In the year of substantial volatility driven by macroeconomic factors and industry headwinds, we continue to invest heavily in client-serving capabilities across our industry-leading platform. These investments, combined with the leadership of our colleagues around the globe, contribute to strong organic growth in both segments to close the year, record operating margin in both segments, record free cash flow, and a return of $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders. Turning to slide 4 on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all businesses and reflecting a level of quarterly organic growth not seen since the second quarter of 2007. As we discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with the management of our renewal book, through right-on-time promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across retail brokerage. New business generation of more than $330 million across our retail business, with record new business in U.S. Retail. In 19 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance. Increased operating leverage from our investments in innovation technology and data and analytics, including from the Global Risk Insight Platform, which now captures over 3 million trades and $160 billion of bound premium, with approximately 40 carriers utilizing the platform today. ReView, a reinsurer dashboard, combined with strategic consulting, help reinsurers be more effective markets for ceding company clients. And our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions. A great example of our innovation in data and analytics recently was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's. An undertaking of data and analytics looking at 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business, and over 157 countries and territories. We've received terrific feedback from clients, bound coverage in every major geography and have generated incremental new business since the launch on January 1. And, finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 6% against the strong comparable in the prior year quarter, driven by a diversified portfolio reflecting industry expertise, product and service capability. The exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulting in stable market impact overall. We saw growth across all regions; U.S. Retail, Canada, and Latin America, including growth across all businesses, property/casualty, health and benefits, and in Affinity, where 16 of 18 underlying product lines were delivering growth. In U.S. Retail, growth was driven by solid retention rates and record new business generation on areas such as P&C, D&O and cyber, while strong management of the renewal book portfolio drove growth in Latin America. In International, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and a continued pressure in the Pacific region. In Continental Europe, we saw solid growth driven by management of the renewal book portfolio, reflecting strong leadership across the region. This positions us well to benefit from potential improvements in a macroeconomic environment. We saw continued strength in New Zealand while Australia showed modest growth. Results also reflect solid growth across Asia where many markets grew double digits including Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 2%, a strong performance against the tough comparison in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter primarily reflect positive growth in treaty globally driven by an increase in (07:08) demand, as well as growth in new products such as U.S. Mortgage and ReView. Across our portfolio, we saw a record level of new business generation in the quarter. While excess capital continues to place pressure in the market, the rate of price decline continues to moderate. Against that price measure, clients are buying more and capital is being deployed to new markets. New opportunities for growth combined with industry-leading data and analytics has positioned our Reinsurance business for return to modest growth in 2016. Overall, across Risk Solutions, we delivered our strongest quarterly rate of organic growth for the year, driven by record new business generation, strong retention rates, and returns on our investments in industry leading data and analytics. Despite fragile macroeconomic conditions and soft pricing in certain areas, we fully anticipate a continuation of low to mid-single digit organic growth in 2016. Turning to HR Solutions, organic revenue growth was 4% with solid growth across both major businesses and in high demand areas where we've invested in innovative solutions and client serving capability. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership and in-depth understanding and influence of market trends. Including, as clients manage risks against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes, solutions to de-risk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions. A strong area of growth where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $75 billion in five years. Continued investment to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices. Across Aon suite of private health exchanges, we enrolled roughly 1.4 million lives across 150 clients in 2015, compared to roughly 1.2 million enrolled lives across 100 clients in 2014, reflecting solid double-digit growth. Participant satisfaction was strong, as 92% of individuals on the Retiree Exchange were satisfied with their advisor, while 88% on the Active Exchange liked being able to choose from multiple carriers. Our solutions for clients continue to bend the cost curve by 150 basis points to 200 basis points on average over a multi-year period, but more than a quarter of returning clients seen a year-over-year decrease. We feel good about the pipeline and our ability to drive greater scale in growth in 2016. We're also investing in Software-as-a-Service model in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversation with existing clients is driving strong demand, as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in our talent and rewards business, as we are seeing strong demand for data and analytics to support increasing organizational change. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting services, organic revenue growth was 4%, overcoming a tough comparable in the prior year that included project work relating to the HAFTA bill. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting solutions. We also saw continued growth in consultation consulting, driven by record growth in participation for survey work as companies require benchmarking and assistance with planned designs to address retention and ways to compete more effectively with a set of strategies. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 4% as well, driven by growth across all major businesses. We saw growth in benefits administration, driven primarily by an increase in project-related work. Results reflect growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. We saw solid growth in healthcare exchanges driven by an increase in the number of enrollments across the platform. Overall, across HR Solutions, client needs are growing in both size and complexity across retirement and health. Our results reflect the solid finish to the year with growth across all major businesses, including strong growth in areas we've been investing to continue delivering sustainable long-term growth. In summary, despite short-term headwinds from both macroeconomic and industry pricing standpoint, our results for both the quarter and the year finished on a high note. We delivered solid organic growth across both segments and strengthened our operational performance driven by our industry-leading platform of client-serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our industry-leading franchise closed the year with a strong performance despite both macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds. Our results in the quarter reflect solid organic growth and record operating margin performance in Risk and HR Solutions. Record free cash flow generation and effective capital management highlighted by the repurchase of approximately $400 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. We returned roughly $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015. Now, let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance excluding certain items increased 20% to $2.27 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.89 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedule from page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization. Further, included in the results was a $0.10 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, EPS grew 25% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year, in line with our compounded annual growth rate of 15% for the last 10 years. Another year of outstanding performance reflecting the strength of our industry-leading franchise and focus on shareholder value creation. Going forward, if currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect substantially less of a headwind with an estimated unfavorable impact of roughly $0.10 for 2016 compared to $0.41 of impact for 2015. We would expect the majority of this impact to be weighted towards the first half of 2016 more so in the first quarter. Now, let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 5%. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 25.7%, and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $27 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 7% versus the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 100 basis points includes a 30 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter. Our fourth quarter performance reflects solid organic growth performance and improved returns on our investments in data and analytics across our portfolio. For 2015, Risk Solutions operating income decreased 2%, which includes a $128 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 5% versus the prior year. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 23.6%, including a 20 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin increased 50 basis points in the year. We delivered strong operational improvement in 2015, with record operating margins despite significant headwinds from an unfavorable market impact in reinsurance and fragile macroeconomic conditions. This level of performance reflects strong new business generation and increased operating leverage in the business, as well as expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure. We expect continued improvement in 2016 and are firmly on track with our long-term target of 26%. In addition, if short-term interest rates continue to rise, we believe we have significant leverage to improving interest rate environment as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income. Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin increased 270 basis points to 26.2% and operating income increased 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $6 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. In addition, there are approximately $12 million or minus 90 basis points of transaction-related and portfolio-repositioning costs incurred in the quarter as we continue to drive improved return on capital. The gain related to the sale of our Absence Management business was reported in other income. Results were driven by organic growth, expense discipline and improved returns on investment, including healthcare exchanges, which delivered modest profitability in 2015. For the full year, operating income increased 7%, including a $20 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 10% compared to the prior year, and operating margins increased 100 basis points to a record 18.1%. This level of performance demonstrates strong improvement over the prior year, reflecting solid financial results in our core business, as well as improved profitability in the areas we've been investing for long-term growth, including delegated investment consulting, cloud-based solutions in HR BPO, and healthcare exchanges. Looking forward, we expect continued operational improvement in 2016 towards our long-term target of 22%, with quarterly patterning of operating income results in HR Solutions similar to 2015. More specifically, down in the first half more so in Q1, and up in the second half most notably Q4. Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses increased $17 million to $61 million due to the timing of certain employee incentive and employee benefit-related expenses, as well as certain investments in shared services. Interest income was $4 million compared to $3 million from the prior-year quarter. Interest expense was $68 million, in line with quarterly guidance. Other income of $49 million primarily includes the gain on the sale of our Absence Management business in Outsourcing and HR Solutions. The sale continues to reflect our effort to drive improved return on capital. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $68 million of interest expense. Turning to taxes. The adjusted effects of tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation in Q2, decreased to 17.9% compared to the prior-year quarter at 19.6% due to the favorable impact of certain discrete tax adjustments. Our estimate of the underlying operating tax rate remains at 19%. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to $279.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $293.4 million in the prior-year quarter as we effectively allocate capital and manage dilution. The company repurchased 4.3 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter. The company has $4.1 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on December 31 were 269.8 million and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 276 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At December 31, 2015, cash and short-term investments were $740 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.7 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.3 times. Cash flow from operations for the year increased 11% or $197 million to a record $2 billion, driven by a decline in pension contributions, restructuring-related payments, cash paid for taxes, and working capital improvements, partially offset by $137 million in cash paid to settle legacy litigation and strong organic growth performance in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow is defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx increased 10% or $163 million to a record $1.7 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $34 million increase in CapEx. The increase in CapEx in 2015 was primarily related to completed investments in certain projects to optimize our global real estate portfolio. As we noted in our press release and related presentations today, during the quarter for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we reclassified certain cash flows related to shares withheld for taxes from cash flow from operations to cash flow from financing. Shares withheld for taxes reflects the choice of colleagues upon vesting to choose gross or net shares to satisfy their withholding requirements. As nearly all colleagues choose to receive net shares, the company then withholds an applicable amount of shares to cover withholding amounts, in effect, creating a share repurchase-like transaction. We believe the reclassification of shares withheld for taxes to cash from financing activities provides greater transparency to the cash flow production from operating results underlines more closely with the accounting treatment of comparable peers. While the reclassification has no actual cash impact on the cash flow statement, as a result of a reclassification, we are increasing our near-term free cash flow goal from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion for the full year 2017. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significantly increasing free cash flow generation. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion is not our end goal, as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. The third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions CapEx from restructuring, which will free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Lastly, I would note that during 2015, we paid $137 million of cash to settle a legacy litigation, which we would expect to provide a tailwind free cash flow growth in 2016. Turning to our pension plans. We have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. Based on December 31, 2015 actuarial assumptions, reported liabilities on a GAAP basis decreased to $1.8 billion at year-end 2015, reflecting a 94% funded status, compared to $2.1 billion at year-end 2014, reflecting a 90% funded status. Not reflected in those amounts, however, are $1 billion of overfunded pension plans that are included in non-current assets in the balance sheet? Considered together, our net unfunded obligations are approximately $800 million. Overall, we expect contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and would expect non-cash pension income to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015. Regarding our restructuring program, cash payments declined by $54 million to $28 million in 2015. As old charges related to restructuring program have been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $9 million or approximately $19 million in 2016, and continue to decline thereafter to an immaterial amount. In summary, our results for both the quarter and the full year reflects solid organic growth, record operating margin performance across both Risk and HR Solutions, strong EPS growth, record free cash flow of $1.7 billion and a return of roughly $1.9 billion in capital to shareholders. Despite challenging macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds, our industry-leading franchise is strongly positioned to help clients manage through increasing complexity, magnitude and volatility across the areas of risk, retirement and health. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. At this time, we don't have any questions on queue.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sorry. Apparently, we're having some difficulty on the queues – on the questions. We've got a number in queue. I can assure you we'll take all the time we need today to answer any and all the questions we've got, so be comfortable with that. We'll work out this logistical glitch a bit. And they're coming up in a bit, so just a little patience and we're going to get this moving as soon as we can. So apologies for that. Redial back in, and I think you'll get to the front of the queue.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Ryan, are you with us?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Dave, I think you might be up.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, Greg.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, please.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Sorry about that. My first question is for Christa, and it's just – I think she said that non-cash pension income will be a benefit this year versus 2015. Just wondering if you could quantify that, what the benefit is?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. It's small, Ryan, but it is going to be up slightly year-over-year.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then just on the reclassification, I guess just trying to understand what's going on here. I think last year you guys still had something like $300 million-plus of share-based compensation that was helping free cash flow, but now it sounds like you're moving something to financing activities. I'm just trying to understand why it sounds like there might be some share-based compensation that's still helping free cash flow and some that might have been moved to financing activities.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So I think the first thing to say, Ryan, is this has – this reclassification has no cash impact on total cash generated or cash paid in previous or future periods. I think the issue you're referring to is actually quite a different issue. The reason we did this was really as a preferable classification and it's consistent with peers. And we feel like it's a much cleaner way to explain our overall cash flow and cash flow growth. The stock compensation expense is stable and has not changed.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then Just one last one, I know the guide to the tax rate is at about 19%, but over the past couple of years, it's coming a little bit below that. I just wanted to make sure the $2.4 billion 2017 free cash flow target, that we can assume that that's – that's assuming a 19% tax rate.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Ryan, we expect 19% to be our underlying operational rate going forward. I think what shows up in any one year is impacted by discrete tax adjustments. They can be positive or negative, and we actually can't forecast them. And the reason our full-year tax rate for 2015 on an adjusted basis was 17.9% was because we had positive discrete tax adjustments. So what we would say is the right underlying rate to model for the company and we use ourselves is 19%, but then discrete tax adjustments can come in positive or negative.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. But – so the 2.4%, though, is absent, though, the discrete tax adjustments, just over the past couple of years, I think, have been positive, correct?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, it is impossible by nature of those adjustments to predict them because they happened at the time.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I'll stop there. Thanks so much, guys.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Farrell of Piper Jaffray. Sir, your line is open.
Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): To your cash flow growth targets, even if we take into account the pension decreases and some of the change, there's some healthy growth there. I'm wondering if you could comment on ReView on the underlying macro trends that you think you might need for that? If we look at the last couple of years, certainly you would probably have more headwinds than we would've thought we're going to have. And do you think you need any of that to reverse – or with the current headwinds that we're seeing, do you think that that cash flow is still achievable? Thank you.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think it's a great question, Dan, because we have had some significant headwinds in the last couple of years, most notably FX, which had a $140 million impact on operating income in calendar year 2015. We would say that we do not need changes in the macro environment to achieve our $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017. If you think about the $1.7 billion of free cash flow we delivered in 2015, you can add back the $137 million of cash we spent on litigation in 2015, and then you can add about $100 million of improvement in free cash flow from decreased uses of cash between now and 2017. So you're already up to $2 billion of free cash flow, and then you really need an incremental $400 million from revenue growth and margin expansion and improved working capital. And so we really believe that we have exceptionally strong free cash flow over the coming years and exceptionally strong free cash flow per share as we expect declining share counts between now and 2017, too.
Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question that we do have comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt of JPMC. Your line is open.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good morning, and congrats on a good quarter. First on the brokerage organic growth, the 5%, this is the best result you've had in years. Could you just talk about what changed versus the third quarter?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Sarah. First, step back, reflect – if you think about brokerage overall, it's consistent with what we're trying to achieve over the course of the year, being able to grow in virtually every environment, and we've been able to do that. And in the fourth quarter, what you're seeing is just at continuation. So for us, it's really nothing new but a continuation of the yield on a lot of the investments we're making in the business and the progress we're making across the business overall. And listen, we saw the new business characteristics in U.S. Retail, for example. These are records – record-on-record, in fact, in terms of sort of what's happened over the course of the last year. So, for us, this is just a continuation in terms of sort of where we are. Across the business, we really like our position now, the way we finish in 2015 and our position in 2016 and the trajectory going into 2016 overall. So for us, what you would read into this is this is just another quarter kind of on a proof point of our underlying capability, and expect continued growth at the same levels going forward and the ability, frankly, to deal with any headwinds that are out there as we've been able to do and move the business forward.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. And then on consulting, the organic growth is usually seasonally highest in the fourth quarter because of private health exchanges. Why wasn't that the case this year? And could you just give us your latest thoughts on what you view is the opportunity for private health exchanges, especially since there has been some press that larger players are a bit slower to adopt and Cadillac tax might be pushed out?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well first, take a step back over all HR Solutions. Again, we love where we finished on the risk side. We really like where we finished on HR Solutions. And this is a business over the course of the year that produced 10% operating income growth, grew at 4%. We made substantial – and by the way, also achieved record margins. We made substantial investment scenarios like retirement and delegated it across the board, and in our Health Solutions. And again, we look at Health Solutions across the board, really every category in terms of the ability to help clients with this very important challenge they've got around the health side. And we think we've got one of the strongest capabilities here whether it's H&B, whether it's global benefits across the board, and on the exchanges. Retiree, active, employee, self, all across the board. And what we would say, if you think about sort of quarter-over-quarter, first, we would agree the adoption on the health active side across the board, especially the larger end, hasn't been as fast as expected. By the way, especially given some of the results we've seen with existing clients because it's been a bit exceptional. Reduced volatility for them, price reductions year-over-year. 25%, in fact, had price reductions over the last year. So we're very, very positive in terms of the overall impact. The pipeline looks very, very strong. And again, even in the exchange business as it exists, we had double-digit growth and it's profitable. So for us, we love this solution on behalf of clients, but as part of our broader health solution. I would reflect, by the way, in the fourth quarter last year, we had the single largest implementation on the retiree side, sort of in the history of the world and maybe will forever be in the history of the world. And that actually influenced results a bit, too. But we really like the business overall tremendously, and we're really feeling good about our position in HR Solutions.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question that we do have comes from the line of Quentin McMillan. Your line is open – from KBW.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Can I ask a question on seasonality, a two-part question? One on just the reinsurance brokerage organic bounce-back this quarter after a couple of quarters of negative growth. So it's nice to see some positive trend there. But the last time that you shared a positive number was in 4Q 2014. It may just be coincidence that that happened year-over-year, but can you talk about sort of how you account for revenue recognition in the reinsurance brokerage and if there's anything to read into that, and then possibly what that could mean for next year or for 4Q 2016? And then on the HR Solutions side, your profitability in the fourth quarter basically doubles from the rest of the quarter. So can you just help us to also understand why there's so much more profitability in 4Q other than just the healthcare exchanges, and if there's anything else that we can kind of look at that? Thanks so much.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So let me do sort of just technically how we account for reinsurance because I think that's one of your questions. So we account for revenue and reinsurance over the course of a 12-month period of time. And so therefore, what you're seeing in Q4 is revenue that was placed over the last 12 months. And that's really for our treaty business I'm talking about, which is about 80% to 85% of our total revenue. So 12-month revenue recognition. So what you're seeing in our Q4 results is the last four quarters of revenue. And so it's sort of a lagging indicator because you're getting price over that last 12 months showing up in our current year's results. The facultative and capital markets, they are recognized in the quarter, so that's sort of 15% to 20% of our revenue.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: And so if you step back on the reinsurance side, basically, in terms of where we finish and thinking about going into 2016. Again, this is consistent with the theme across the company. We feel very good about how we finish the year and what it sets to save for in 2016. Obviously, again, looking at in terms of the overall year, we're not happy with the level of growth and reinsurance of negative 1% for the year. But we've said already, we expect reinsurance to return a positive organic growth in 2016. And for us – especially for our reinsurance business maybe more than any other. It's a great example of a business right now as business results don't really reflect the underlying capability and opportunity we see, which is exceptional. I mean, think about it, we're the largest adviser in the world in this area and really, number one in treaty, number one in fact, number one on the alternative capital side, capital markets. 20% of the global book is linked to U.S. property cat and that's wholly commission based. Those rates have come down 15% to 25% over the last 24 months and that's been reflected. Probably those are starting to flatten out a bit; the decrease is not as great. But against that, it's really been the team's ability to continue to win 19 consecutive quarters of wins on treaty reinsurance, which had been exceptional, and really, the ability to create net new demand. And this is really in areas like mortgage overall and what we've done in ReView. So they've been able to offset these headwinds, which are diminishing, those businesses that they've offset whether they're going to continue to grow. And the opportunity going into 2016, we feel very good. And we'd say, by the way, just technically, the 2% in this quarter is on top of a 5% in the Q4 2014, so it was kind of on top of a very strong comparable. So, we feel good about the position, and we love this business. We're very excited about it. So maybe we go back to Christa on the HR Solutions side on sort of the seasonality overall.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So what I would describe, Quentin, is we have an HR business which is very seasonally orientated towards the second half of the year, and in particular towards Q4. As we think about the patenting for HR Solutions in 2016, it will look very similar to 2015 where from an operating income point of view, we are down in the first half, particularly in Q1. We're up in the second half, particularly in Q4. As you think about the overall HR Solutions business, we really have a very significant bias towards Q4 with annual enrollment in our benefits administration business primarily occurring in Q4, and healthcare exchanges primarily occurring in Q4 where you have expenses showing up in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 and revenue really coming through in Q4. And so that's why we're primarily a Q4-orientated business in terms of revenue and therefore operating income.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: That's perfect. Thanks so much guys. And if I can sneak one more in, just in terms of the leverage that you guys have. The debt to EBITDA came down from 2.6 to 2.3 in the quarter. And I think you'd previously indicated that you were sort of comfortable with that 2.6 level, and a willingness and an indication that you wanted to – you could use shares in the – I'm sorry, use debt in the future to repurchase shares. Is that still sort of the lineup to where your – what you think for 2016 and going forward? And what level do you feel comfortable at?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. It's a great question, Quentin. So what we would say is strong free cash flow generation, and therefore EBITDA growth allows us to continue to increase leverage in line with the 2 to 2.5 times leverage ratio. So we do see the opportunity for incremental leverage, given the strong free cash flow and EBITDA growth of the company.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much, guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question that we do have comes from the line of Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is open.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. The sale of the Absence Management company, just a couple of points around that. Was that business higher or lower margin than your overall? In other words, will that help the margin going forward?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So as we think about the Absence Management business, it's a terrific business, helping businesses really manage their workforce overall. One of the things we would say about that business is given the high demand from corporations to manage their workforce and of the absence of their employees over time, it has significant – very high capital requirement to invest in this business over the coming years. And as we look at our strategy, it's not as core to our strategy as some other areas in which we've been investing. And so as we think about the need to invest capital in this business over the coming years, we do believe that Guardian has a much higher priority in this area and they're going to substantially invest. And so we feel really good about partnering with them to continue to serve our clients in this area. We did not disclose the financials in this business, but you should think about this business as overall in line with our focus on improvement return on capital.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And then just detail on that. I think you mentioned maybe $12 million of transaction cost. Was that in the operating line or was that adjusted out?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It is included in our HR Solutions operating income so it is in the operating line. So as we think about this business, there is obviously a gain that shows up in other income, which is quite significant. And then there are transaction costs and severance related to this showing up in the operating income of HR Solutions.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And was the revenue for the Absence Management, was that pulled out for the fourth quarter or was that in the fourth quarter?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It was in the fourth quarter.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Then on the – staying with the solutions on the HR cloud business. Is that business growing materially faster than your overall business? And how's the pipeline of large clients looking for 2016?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah...
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: This business has done exceptionally well. We love the position overall and it's growing well above double-digits. The fundamental capability we've got and the need clients have around HR transformation and improvement is just exceptional. And the capability we've got on the Workday front in particular is really, really carving out a lot of space there for us. And we're seeing the growth, not only in the HR side, but we're also seeing it as clients think about beyond HR transformation, how it relates to finance transformation. And this combination has just been incredibly positive. By the way, Aon itself has going to do the same thing. We adopted Workday on the HR side. We've now adopted Workday and are implemented on the finance side. And we see the potential, and our clients see it as well. So for us, this has been a very, very strong growth business. We really like the capabilities here and the prospects on behalf of our clients.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. And just one more. In the risk business, how much are exposures helping more now than a couple of quarters ago?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Exposures continue to be helpful. And by the way, it is the right question because in the end, a lot's discussed on price. It really is an issue of exposures as much as price. And again, we can clinically look at this with the Risk Insight Platform across our entire book at a very micro level. When you add all that together, price and exposures, they're net-net stable. So, the market roughly is stable. So, a little up, a little down but roughly it's been stable. And I'm really looking at the chart right now across multiple quarters and it's, give or take, stable. The prices have come down a little bit, exposures have come up and we – just how the market overall has performed. From our standpoint, that's right, we don't really look at market conditions as an excuse not to grow or reinforcement to grow. We're going to grow either way, we have proven we can do that. 2015 is another example of that. We'll see it in 2016. And we've more than offset price changes and exposure changes with net new business and net new capabilities we brought to the marketplace, as well as our ability to retain our existing book of business and actually add services on to that. So, for us, overall, it's been market stable. And our ability to deal with it has been quite positive.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. The next question that we do have comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you so much. Good morning. First question is on the HR Solutions. And in the past, you have been guiding like year-over-year improvements in terms of underlying margin, as well as operating income; it grows from mid to high single digits. I just wonder is that still valid going forward?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi. We fully expect to grow revenue organically, to continue to expand margins and to grow operating income in HR Solutions as we have in 2015.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then just a number of question on the free cash flow target $2.4 billion looks like 2015 the reclassification as you benefit about more than $200 million. So, the raise of your guidance, the $100 million, I just wonder what's the calculation behind it?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think one of these things that shares with help from taxes is really driven. The amount is the result of employee choice and the market value of the stock, two variables of which we have no control. So, as we think about it, we think that we have very strong free cash flow growth over the next coming years, and therefore, $2.4 billion is the right number. And this particular element we took out really has no impact on cash. And so we think that, therefore, $2.4 billion is the right goal going forward.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So there's no change in the underlying forecast for your free cash flow target?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And lastly, Greg, if you could talk about on the acquisition front because the buybacks have been very meaningful return to shareholders. I just wonder like in this marketplace, where do you see the platform capability you could help grow like in the future and how do you balance between acquisitions versus shared buybacks?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Kai. We actually look at both, and if you look at our history over the last 10 years, we've actually been a little more leaning towards acquisitions when you look at some of the amount of our overall investments versus what the buyback has been over time. And underlying that, if you look back over the last 10 years, our operating income growth year-over-year has been roughly 11%. So, it's something we've really invested in. And invested heavily in organic improvement as well, as I've described before. The level of capabilities that we're investing in for existing clients, new clients and on the data and analytics side is we believe candidly quite unprecedented. If you think about data and analytics, Global Risk Insight Platform to ReView to the Aon Client Treaty now at the endpoint, all the work we've done and delegated exchanges, you get the picture. So, we're very, very much focused on investment back into the business. And M&A plays a big role on that, and will continue to play a big role on that. And we probably – I'm looking at Christa – we'll probably look at more deals this year, situations this year that may be any time at our history measured in the billions. Done fewer of them, because we're always going to be disciplined around return on investment capital. Christa has in place a very, very structured way to think about how we can very meticulously invest our capital to get to the highest return on capital, generate free cash flow and build wealth for our shareholders. And in the context of that, serve clients in a very, very effective way. And that's really the machine we've set up. That's how the engine runs and that's what we've done. So, we're going to continue to look at where the best places to place our capital. And we'll be open to acquisitions as we are, organic investment, buyback, and all of the above. That's really how we're looking at it.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Specifically, kind of a follow-up, if there's a price like discussion about wholesale platform. I'm wondering, if that's something would be of your interest?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Again we're not going to comment on specific situations or categories. But you can imagine, we're going to do what we need to do to actually support our clients and deliver distinctive value to our clients and do it in a way, again, that returns benefits to our shareholders. So, we're going to look at capabilities across the board. We've partnered with great capability on the wholesale side. We're going to continue to do that and always look at options.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Well, thank you so much, and good luck.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: All right.
Operator: Thank you. The next question that we do have comes from the line of Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee CRT. Your line is open.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Hi. Good morning. So the first question is on the HR Solutions. Margins grew by 100 basis points this year, while organic revenue growth was actually lower this year, that's 2015 versus 2014. Curious how you've managed to expand margins even though the organic revenues were lower this year versus last year.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. It's a great question, and I think it's really about the investments we've made, Vinay, and the areas of growth that we've outlined: delegated investment management, HR BPO and our cloud solutions, and healthcare exchanges. And they are generating great returns on investments, which is how we're able to continue to expand margins and grow operating income at lower levels of organic growth. And so, we will continue to manage the portfolio on a return-on-capital basis. And generating improved cash flow from the investments we've made organically and inorganically in our business.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Vinay, really what's been highlighted here is the idea of operational leverage. And a lot of the core organic investments we make in the areas Christa described, same is true, by the way, on the Risk Solutions side, is the reason, again, back to we're very confident, comfortable talking about margin expansion in lower growth environments. By the way, don't take away from that that we're not interested in growing organically. We're absolutely focused on that and that is a high priority, and we'll continue to do that. But our ability to actually produce results in a variety of environments is really a function of our ability to invest heavily back in the business from an organic standpoint.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: So that's helpful. And now within the segment, I believe there were $12 million of costs. So should we sort of add back those $12 million to say that that's the normalized operating income for the segment for this year?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I think that's probably right.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Great. And then one last question, just on the free cash flow and maybe my math is not that great, but my understanding is that the reclassification helped the free cash flow by about $200 million. And the future guidance for free cash flow has increased only by $100 million. So, have the underlying cash flows for the future sort of come down by $100 million?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, they have not. So, one of the things that I tried and obviously failed to communicate earlier was this number varies substantially by year. And the amount is a result of employee's choice, growth in net shares and the market value of our stock. Therefore, we have no control over the number. As we think about our free cash flow going forward, there is no change to our view on the underlying free cash flow growth of the firm. We do believe that this amount going forward is somewhere between $0 and $100 million, therefore, we've increased our target by $100 million to $2.4 billion. One of the other things I would make clear is that the $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017 is fully deployable cash, because if you look at the $1.7 billion we generated in 2015, we actually returned $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders in 2015. So, we are generating a huge amount of cash, which we can fully deploy on either return to shareholders or, as Greg said, investing back into our business either organically or inorganically in the form of M&A. So we're very excited about the future growth potential of the firm given the huge cash flow generation we're going to produce.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question we do have comes from the line of Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning and thank you. I guess, the first question, Christa, a follow-up to the free cash flow question going forward. With regard to the working capital improvement, I guess, I was just hoping you can just help me understand a little bit how that is truly incremental as opposed to timing. I guess, if I think you pull in your accounts receivable and push out payables is a timing issue, but is there something else in that that's truly incremental to free cash flow?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Well, the one other thing that I would say is that we are on a sort of march now to really improve our flow-through of every $1 of revenue through to $1 of free cash flow. And I would say we're on a 10-year journey to get there. I think the overall industry in which we operate has not been particularly focused on free cash flow, and I think it has been a journey for us, which we've been on really for the last, you know, almost five years. And I think as we continue to improve the collection of cash from customers and we continue to manage the payment of cash to suppliers, we believe that we have improvements in cash for at least the next five years to eight years in terms of working capital. And it's structural improvements in the process around which we do this, in the way in which we manage this, in the overall portfolio of business we do. So, I guess, what I would say as you think about Aon, we believe we should be working capital neutral overall and we are far from that today. So, we believe the upside in terms of cash from working capital is substantial over the coming years.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I guess, and obviously you guys are a different business or like in a different business, but I guess in some other industries if you pull in your receivables faster, an incremental improvement might be of less charge-offs, right? You have less credit events; that there's something is truly is incrementally increasing as opposed to just the time value of money by getting that cash flow today versus 90 days from now. I guess I'm wondering, is there structural elements in that improvement for you or is it timing related?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's absolutely structural. If you think about today, we are tying up a huge amount of cash, essentially, by not collecting the cash from customers early enough, or by paying suppliers. And so, as we think about return on capital of Aon, we are managing our overall portfolio to improve cash in this area. And we would say, we are making structural process improvements, and have for the last couple of years. You can see it if you look at receivables divided by revenue you can see days sales outstanding improve over time. And the same on the supplier side. And so, whether we're improving invoice velocity or eliminating prepaid expenses, there are a number of structural things we're doing to improve the flow-through of $1 revenue to $1of free cash flow.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I appreciate that. I guess, finally just on the risk business and the investments you guys have made in the data and analytics. I think now we more clearly see on the reinsurance side or maybe the GRIP program with the insurance carriers. I was hoping you might be able to just expound a little bit on where maybe some of these data and analytic investments are helping you improve the retail. I don't know if you need to charge for it at the retail level or if it flows through in organic growth. And that piece of it, if you think of kind of the multitude pieces in the risk business, the real core retail side and where the data and analytics is helping the business there.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: So the effort on data and analytics has really been multi-year and ongoing. And for us, we believe it's going to be fundamental to what we needed to try to get it accomplished over time, Charles. It really is going to be differentiated in terms of our capability versus the marketplace. And there are many examples. By the way, the risk insight platform efforts really are actually, the work is done directly with the primary insurers serving clients. So it actually touches very much the primary insurance marketplace. But let me give you one example that – I happened to be just in London yesterday with Lloyd's and Lloyd's syndicates. We just launched something called Aon Client Treaty, which is a very – it's basically built on a foundation around data and analytics. So in essence, it will be, when done, the single biggest underlying transaction likely in the history of Lloyd's to-date and it really takes our book that goes into the London market to our global broking center and we actually modeled that book in detail, really bottom up, all different aspects of what's going on. 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business, 157 countries. You get the idea. We built an incredible data room in which underwriters will come in and actually take a company-level understanding at underwriting and then apply it to portfolio level. And in essence, what we're saying to our client, by the way, on Monday happening at our Property Symposium, I'm talking to clients in our Property Symposium and essentially saying if you're going to use London capacity, you've eliminated your tail risks. So when you actually think about the set of syndicates that are actually going to come to bear on behalf of you, the last three, four, or five actually create risk. We've eliminated that. So we've actually pre-confirmed 20% of that capacity that will follow a lead capacity going into London. That makes that capital we're bringing to bear much, much more competitive. So there's an example of hard clear data and analytics but essentially we've analyzed our book sort of, it happens to be in the London marketplace, but imagine, we can look at this all over the world in which we're actually providing distinctive value, unduplicated value to clients using data and analytics. So, that was a little bit longwinded, but I hope you get the idea that it's a very powerful tool. By the way, in order to do that, you had to be able to analyze all 6,000 clients going into London in a way that, frankly, leverages off our risk insight platform. Never been done before.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much for the answers.
Operator: Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Case for the closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Excellent. Well, let me apologize again for the logistics during the Q&A. If anything comes up and you want to ask us, please feel free. We're available at any time. And just appreciate everybody for being on the call today. And look forward to catching up at the end of the first quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: That concludes this conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to the Aon Plc Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2015 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders, and second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to slide 3. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 2% overall with growth across both segments, highlighted by 5% growth in the HR Outsourcing business and 4% growth in the Americas Retail Brokerage business. Operating margin increased 30 basis points, reflecting solid operating performance in both segments. EPS decreased 4% to $1.24 as unfavorable foreign currency translation and a gain on the sale of a business in the prior year more than offset organic growth, operational improvement and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow for the nine months is up 21% to $850 million, a strong performance driven by operational improvement and working capital management. Turning to slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 1% overall in our seasonally weakest quarter, similar to the prior year, reflecting growth across Retail Brokerage partially offset by decline in Reinsurance. For the nine months, organic revenue growth is 2%, in line with our expectation of low to mid-single-digit growth going into our seasonally strongest quarter. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening the underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with: management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, new business generation of $240 million across our Retail business with record new business in U.S. Retail, 18 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance, increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology and data and analytics including in the Global Risk Insight Platform which now captures over $2.9 million trades and $139 billion of bound premium with more than 40 carriers utilizing the platform today. ReView, our reinsurer dashboard, combined with strategic consulting, helped reinsurers be more effective markets for ceding company clients. And our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region while the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulting in continued stable market impact overall. We saw growth across all regions. U.S. Retail, Latin America and Canada including growth across all businesses, property casualty, health and benefits, and affinity. In U.S. Retail and Canada, growth was driven by strong new business generation while strong management of the renewal book drove growth in Latin America. In International, organic revenue growth was 1%. Exposures continue to be stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and continued pressure in the Pacific region. We saw strong growth in New Zealand, driven by double-digit new business generation. Results also reflect solid growth across Asia, primarily in emerging markets, China and Thailand, driven by strong management of the renewal book portfolio. In Continental Europe, we continue to see modest growth and with strong leadership across the region we are well-positioned to benefit from potential improvements in the macroeconomic environment. In Reinsurance, organic revenue declined 4% similar to the prior year quarter, and for the nine months was minus 2%, roughly in-line with our expectation of a modest decline for the year. Results in the quarter primarily reflect significant unfavorable market globally, a modest decline in facultative placements, and modest unfavorable impact from timing. In our treaty portfolio, we saw a record level of new business generation in the quarter, driven by an increase in ceding demand and growth in new products, primarily such as U.S. Mortgage and ReView. And while excess capital continues to place pressure on the market, the rate of price decline continues to moderate. Against that price pressure, clients are buying more and capital is being deployed to new markets. New opportunities for growth combined with industry-leading data and analytics is positioning the business for a return to growth on a quarterly basis in the next 12 months. Overall, across Risk Solutions, we continue to deliver new business generation and strong retention, driven by a unified approach to serving clients across the portfolio and industry-leading data and analytics. We expect improved performance in the fourth quarter, placing us firmly on track for solid organic revenue growth for the full year 2015 despite continued pricing pressure in Reinsurance and fragile economic conditions in Continental Europe. Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 5%, with solid growth across both major businesses and in high demand areas where we have invested in innovative solutions in client-serving capability. These reflect investments from Aon in client leadership and our in-depth understand and influence on overall market trends, including as clients manage risk against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes. Solutions to derisk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions are a strong area of growth where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $70 billion in five years. Continued investment to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices. Across Aon's suite of private health exchanges, we expect to enroll roughly 1.4 million lives across 150 clients, compared to roughly 1.2 million lives across 100 clients in the prior year, broken down into active exchange with 1 million enrolled lives across 55 clients, and retiree exchange with 400,000 enrolled lives across 75 clients. The growth reflects continued progress to achieve scale and drive new revenue as roughly two-thirds of all clients who have joined the exchange are new to Aon. Our growth reflects both self and fully-insured solutions, including the industry's leading large corporate, fully-insured multi-carrier model. Our range of solutions provide clients with a unique ability to seamlessly transition between funding choices depending on their level of risk tolerance. In addition, representation now spans 22 distinct industries. We look forward to providing further details after we complete the enrollment in the fourth quarter, with potential further updates on client wins as we're already in very active discussions for 2016 off-cycle and 2017 enrollment. We would also highlight our investment in Software-as-a-Service model and our HR BPO business where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial limitations. And finally, we're investing in our talent rewards business as we're seeing strong demand for data and analytics that support increasing organizational change. Turning to our individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3%. The prior year quarter included a significant favorable benefit from timing due to a change in revenue recognition policy in our compensation consulting business. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services. We also saw continued growth in consultation consulting driven by demand for survey work as companies require benchmarking and assistance with plan design to address retention and ways to compete for talent more effectively. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect solid growth in benefits administration driven by an increase in project-related work and growth in our absence management business. We also saw continued growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins and cloud-based solutions and growth in our healthcare exchange business from off-cycle enrollments on the retiree exchange. Overall for HR Solutions, we are well positioned to deliver continued organic revenue growth across both segments for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, driven by high demand areas where we've made investments as well as continued leadership across our core businesses. In summary, despite short-term headwinds, we continue to drive growth across both segments, improve our operational performance and deliver significant free cash flow growth. Looking forward, we expect a strong finish to the year and continued long-term growth driven by our industry-leading platform of client-serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you so much, Greg. And good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our third quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter and we continued to face both macroeconomic and specific industry headwinds. However, against these headwinds, the strength of our industry-leading franchise continues to perform. Our results in the quarter reflect organic growth and operating margin improvement across both Risk and HR Solutions, substantial free cash flow growth and effective capital management, highlighted by the repurchase of $600 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. Now, let me turn to financial results for the quarter on page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, decreased 4% to $1.24 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.29 in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included a $25 million pre-tax or $0.07 per share after-tax gain related to the sale of a business. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization. Further, included in the results was a $0.09 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our core earnings per share in the third quarter would have been $1.33, up 3% from the prior year quarter. Going forward, while currency movement has been challenging to predict, if currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a similar impact in Q4 as we incurred in Q3 due to continued U.S. dollar strengthening. As we look forward to 2016, we would anticipate substantially less of a headwind as year-over-year comparisons become easier with an unfavorable impact of roughly $0.05 to $0.10 per share for the full year 2016 compared to approximately $0.41 of impact for the full year 2015. I would note this assumes FX rates remain stable at today's rates. Now, let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 1%. Operating margin increased 50 basis points to 20.8%, and operating income decreased 6% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $25 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, operating income increased 1% versus the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 50 basis points reflects the 40 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 10 basis points in the quarter, driven by continued operational improvement in our seasonally weakest quarter. Overall, in Q3, we delivered underlying operational performance in Risk Solutions despite continued headwinds from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance, fragile market conditions in Europe and historically low interest rates. If short-term interest rates were to rise, we believe we have significant leverage for an improving interest rate environment, as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income. For the first nine months, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating income increased 4% and operating improved 50 basis points. As we approach our seasonally strongest quarter in Risk Solutions, performance places us firmly on track for further margin expansion in 2015 towards our long-term target of 26%, driven by growth, return on investments, and expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate and global procurement. Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 5%, operating margin increased 90 basis points and operating income increased 6%. Results reflect solid organic revenue growth, expense discipline and improved profitability in the areas where we've been investing for long-term growth including: delegated investment consulting, cloud-based solutions in HR BPO, and healthcare exchanges where we believe we have achieved enough scale to deliver modest profitability in 2015. For the first nine months, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating income increased 6% and operating margin improved 30 basis points. As we approach our seasonally strongest quarter in HR Solutions, performances places us firmly on track for further margin expansion in 2015 towards our long-term target of 22%, driven by growth, return on investments and expense discipline. Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $45 million, in line with quarterly guidance. Interest income was $3 million, similar to the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $7 million to $72 million due to an overlap of expiring debt in the quarter. Other income of $8 million primarily includes net gains from certain long-term investments, while the prior year quarter benefited from the sale of certain businesses and net gains in certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense and $2 million per quarter of interest income. Interest expense in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $68 million as $600 million of overlapping notes were paid in September. Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation in Q2, decreased to 16% compared to the prior year quarter at 19.1% due to the favorable impact of certain discrete tax adjustments. Our underlying operating tax rate remains at 19%. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 283.8 million in the third quarter compared to 296.1 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased 6.3 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $600 million in the third quarter. The company has $4.5 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 273.9 million and there are approximately 7 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2015 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 281 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. Now, let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow on slide 10. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $783 million. Total debt outstanding increased to approximately $6.1 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis increased to 2.6 times. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months increased 22%, or $192 million, to $1.1 billion driven by working capital improvements, a decline in pension contributions, restructuring and cash paid for taxes, partially offset by a significant increase in cash paid to settle legacy litigation flowing through net income in the second quarter. The increase in cash paid of $137 million to settle legacy litigation in the previous quarter will provide a tailwind to free cash flow growth in 2016. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 21% or $146 million to $850 million, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations partially offset by a $46 million increase in CapEx. The anticipated increase in CapEx in 2015 is associated with investment in certain real estate projects as we continue to optimize our real estate portfolio globally. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility and the opportunity to further increase cash flow generation. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of delivering $2.3 billion or more for the full year 2017. Free cash flow of $2.3 billion is not our end goal, as further long term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. We continue to believe the plans we put in place have positioned the firm to benefit from abnormal growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share in the near term, providing significant opportunity for shareholder value creation. From the graph in the presentation, based on current assumptions, we expect annual free cash flow to increase by approximately $230 million from the year-end 2014 to year-end 2017 based only on a reduction in cash use of pensions, restructuring, and CapEx. Combined with operational improvement in the business, lower cash tax payments and working capital improvements in areas such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, we have line of sight to delivering on our expectations for substantial free cash flow generation. Regarding our pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants and frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to derisk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly $96 million to $220 million in 2015 and continue to decline thereafter. These expectations are based on 12/31/2014 actuarial assumption. A rise in global long term interest rates could potentially decrease contributions further. Regarding our restructuring program, cash payments were $82 million in 2014. As all charges related to the restructuring program have now been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $51 million to approximately $31 million in 2015 and continue to decline significantly each year thereafter. In summary, we delivered organic growth and margin expansion across both segments as we continue to manage expense and create greater operating leverage from our investments in data and analytics. Strong operating performance in the fourth quarter combined with declining uses of cash and working capital improvements are expected to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for 2015, placing us firmly on track towards our goal of generating more than $2.3 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017. With a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we've positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation in 2015 and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Our first question will be coming from Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Dave, you might be on mute. Go to the next one, operator.
Operator: Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Your line is open.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Can you guys hear me at this point?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We can.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. We can.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Great. So, first of all, I was just saying thanks for taking the questions but you missed that part. But wanted to talk a little bit about the Americas business, the Retail side there held up well at plus 4% and I guess I was surprised it did so well considering it includes Latin America where you've got economies like Brazil which are now experiencing a GDP decline. So, can you help me understand, is the outperformance or the strong performance there in Latin America continuing or are we doing just that much better in the other parts of Canada and the U.S. to offset some of the pressure that might be going on in Latin America?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Actually Dave, we have solid growth across the board and it comes in different categories in different places but if you think about how we think about growth, it's new business and then retention, something we call rollover, overall. And we've been able to generate substantial new business growth which is new clients coming into the firm as well as doing more with existing clients, which is retaining, and then rollover, which is actually doing more with them. And then in businesses like our affinity business which has been exceptionally strong, we're also seeing substantial growth. And we really have on the U.S. side record new business generation. So a lot of the investments we've made over time continue to reap benefits and you're seeing the results. Would emphasize again, though, look at it on an annual basis. Quarter-to-quarter always moves around to different places but it's a very very positive piece overall.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And on HR Solutions, the margins up 90 basis points there year-over-year in light of what I think – I think you guys had a tough comp last year where you had some favorable timing that lifted revenue and margins. Was there any sort of timing in this quarter? Obviously you guys talked about two of the three factors that did help this quarter and if you could elaborate, to what extent are those sustainable versus sort of project-oriented and maybe one-time in nature?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. We feel really good about the performance of HR Solutions, not just in Q3 but really in the nine months year to date. We've had operating income growth of 6% excluding FX in the nine months year to date and margin expansion of 30 basis points and we would say they are well on track to solid revenue growth, margin expansion, and operating income growth for the full year. And that's really coming from the return on the investments we've made. We're getting continued revenue growth and margin expansion from the significant investments we made in delegated investment consulting and health care exchanges and in HR BPO SaaS.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Great. And then just lastly on the exchanges, it sounds like the $1.4 million, is that a estimate for January or sort of year-end 2016? And I guess that implies something along the lines of 15% or 20% membership growth which is maybe a little bit lower than peers. Curious to hear sort of what you're seeing in the market, is there some clients who maybe have deferred or what is sort of your thoughts on the adoption and pace of adoption relative to your expectations?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I'd say step back overall. First of all, the number we report,1.4 million, is enrolled lives. So, these are actually folks who are paying us and money is changing hands for solutions we provide. And there's a lot going on around definitions and how different folks describe the business overall. We are very explicit about how we describe it around enrolled lives. I would say, Dave, overall, we agree the adoption across the board, when you think about it, especially at the larger end of the market, has not been as fast as we would have expected. This is especially true given the results we've seen with our existing exchange clients. I mean, we have been able to sustainably lower cost, reduced volatility and, very importantly, the employee choice has gone up, and there's very, very high satisfaction. Our view is we're very confident that, over time, you're going to see the market develop. It's going to accelerate. It's going to be an uneven pace, no doubt. But our pipeline is strong. We're in discussions with a number of very large innovative companies around solutions and ideas, and so we feel very, very good about the development. I would highlight, we've gone from zero to 1.4 million lives as – and Christa described, we're marginally profitable in 2015. So, we've made progress, and we're seeing continued development on that platform. But last point I'd make on this, it is important to put this in context over overall health effort. I mean, we love the health space. We believe in it, we believe we're going to make a difference globally on behalf of our clients. And from classic health, health and benefits, global benefits, I'd just remind you, we place more than $10 million in health benefits in the U.S. alone every year and the exchanges have been very, very strong, zero to 1.4 million. By the way, as I said in my opening comments, two-thirds of the clients who've come in in the exchanges are new to Aon and 150 clients overall. And so we see this as very, very positive continued development. And overall, in the context of the health opportunities, we see it as quite strong.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's helpful. So just the paying numbers, sort of what you'd get in January, is what that 1.4 million is then, right?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Correct.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Lot that's going on mid cycle. Lot that's going on in terms of overall (28:12), but that's literally clinically as of today.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Next, we have Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is open.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. So just one follow-up on the active exchange. So for those large clients, what are the one or two factors that's holding them back from pulling the trigger right now?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think, Adam, actually it's a range of different pieces. And it really – they don't look at it as this year or next year. They're really looking at what's the best interest over time of their employee base and how that's developing. They're also looking at sort of the trend line in the marketplace and what's happening with overall health costs and level of urgency. And so for them, it really is a range of different items. We would come back to – for the clients who we brought into this environment, the impact has been substantial and now sustained over a multi-year period. And more and more companies are seeing that and actually taking some comfort in some of the sustainability of the overall model. But as I said before, the pipeline is strong and this is going to develop. If you think back, the lessons around DB to DC and the overall solutions, these things take a period of time. But what we keep coming back to is the fundamental value proposition is quite strong and now sustained and we think that's going to carry the day over time. But still keep coming back to, though, it's about an overall health platform and a level of demand across health which we think is going to continue to go up and the exchanges serve one part of that overall market.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then on cash flow, the operating cash flow from operations was very strong this quarter. It jumped from $365 million to almost $1.1 billion. I guess two questions. One, was there anything unusual in that? And also, historically third quarter is strong but fourth quarter is stronger from an operating cash flow, should that continue to hold?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Adam, I think that's a great question. We are exceptionally pleased with the cash flow in the nine months year-to-date. There are no unusual items in there. And yes, Q4 is our seasonally strongest cash flow quarter. And so, we are well on track to deliver double digit free cash flow growth in 2015. The thing I would note that was unusual in calendar year 2015 was the $137 million impact to cash in Q2 that was an outflow of cash on litigation settlements.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: True. Okay. And then also on cash flow. I think you said you expect $230 million annually of free cash flow, does that exclude or not include just normal improvement from earnings?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, what I referred to there was from year-end 2014 to year-end 2017, you can see in the slides that we posted on our website that there was an increase in cash flow of $230 million just from decreased cash spent on pension restructuring and capital expenditure.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. Okay
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: There are really four big drivers of cash flow to get to our $2.3 billion in cash by 2017. The first is obviously growth in revenue and expansion in margin which will lead to operating income growth. The second is working capital improvements and we think they are sustainable for many years to come. The decreased uses of cash I just talked about. And the reduction in tax rate leading through to less cash spent on taxes.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then finally, from what we hear, the Workday service implementation business is doing very well. Would you say that's growing much faster than your overall HR Consulting business? And as you look to 2016-2017, are you doing more types of products, not just Workday but adding other software suites to that business?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, we've obviously invested significantly in this area of business through the acquisition of OmniPoint and the acquisition of Kloud. We are very pleased with the breadth of solutions we can offer clients in the HR BPO space and, obviously, Software-as-a-Service offers a much more feature rich and effective set of services for clients at a much lower cost. And so it's a very high area of growth for us and it's continuing to grow double-digits. And so we feel really good about this solution and being able to continue to grow this solution set for clients.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: And we put in context with the other investments we're making in terms of overall size. On the investment consulting side, the delegated side, investments on talent, obviously exchanges we've talked about. So, there's a portfolio of investments we're making and fully funding, by the way, as part of the P&L that we can drive performance and invest for the future.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: And would you say the margin on that business equal or greater to your average HR Consulting margins?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: What we've said historically on our – as we think about our margin growth, from where we are in HR Solutions, let's call it 17% today to our 22% long-term target that there are really three big drivers of margin expansion. The first is the return on the investments that we've made. We've invested a lot in delegated and exchanges, et cetera. The second is the growth in margins in our HR BPO business. We've talked historically about our HR BPO business being about a $500 million business that had very low single-digit margins. And, really, one of the things that is driving the expansion in margin is our investments in BPO staff and these innovative solutions for clients. And the third driver of margin expansion in HR Solutions is our expense discipline and continuing to manage expenses very carefully around IT, real estate and procurement.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Next, we have Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Sarah.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: In insurance brokerage, the organic growth in the quarter of 1% was at the lower end of your target of low to mid-single-digit organic growth. Is there anything unusual that depressed that and should we expect to see a rebound in the fourth quarter and 2016?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Sarah. I would characterize, really, and Christa started on this path. If you really look at for the first nine months of the year, first nine months of the year is as strong or stronger now than it was against 2014. So, the short answer is, no. In fact, look at it over the course of the year, nothing has changed. We would characterize the quarter as a quarter of continued progress against long-term objectives. And look at Risk, organic revenue for the nine months was 2%, operating income increased 2%, margin up 50 basis points. That's roughly where it was last year. We're now going into our strongest quarter. We believe the Reinsurance business is improving. Continental Europe looks a bit more positive or at least stable. A lot of the investments we've made are very, very good. So, from our standpoint, we feel like this quarter in Risk, and by the way in HR Solutions as well, is just another good quarter of continued progress.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then in HR Solutions, last year you did high single digit adjusted operating income growth and given that the private exchange enrollment for 2016 sounds – it's going to be a little bit lighter than we would have expected. Is that – can you still achieve that level of growth for the full year?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sarah, we are exactly on track with the goals we outlined for HR Solutions for the full year. We're going to grow organically, we're going to expand margins, and we're going to grow operating income in 2015.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. But no clarity on to what extent you can grow operating income, because it tends to be pretty lumpy, right, quarter to quarter?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, we have said, Sarah, that we are going to be modestly profitable in healthcare exchanges for the full year 2015.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks for the answers.
Operator: Next, we have Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open
Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Good morning and thanks for the call. I wanted to ask a little bit about the M&A outlook in general, and perhaps a little bit in specific in that it looks like you're actually divesting a little bit more than you're acquiring. Is that typical of the trend? You're obviously doing a lot of activity in the area. Could you just give us some general sense about what you think the direction of M&A is going for for Aon? What the outlook in general is for the sector?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We would, Paul, not observe that trend In fact, if you think back and just reflect on Aon over the last 10 years, we've done roughly $8 billion in acquisitions over that period of time. And we said before, we're probably on track for kind of $200 million to $500 million a year, really adding content and capability that we can expand across our portfolio. We're looking to do that all the time. To the extent, we divest it really is discipline around return on invested capital. We're deploying capital around the world whether it's acquisitions or buyback or whatever, organic investment around the discipline that Christa has set up really gauging each investment around improving return on invested capital. So to the extent, we end up divesting something, it's because we've made a determination that it's better off in somebody else's hands on behalf of our clients and we'll do that from time to time. But if you just think about just even in 2014, we did $500 million in acquisitions in a Flood business which we really love across the U.S. and a benefits business in the UK. So we are excited about adding capability when it makes sense to add capability.
Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: So we should assume that it's a positive number in terms of the revenue impact for, prospectively, from acquisitions.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would say, generally, if you look over the last 10 years, absolutely, it will be a positive number. Again, it will be lumpy depending on what happens from quarter-to-quarter but overall absolutely positive.
Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: And I apologize, one more exchange question. A lot of your peers have talked about a move towards more middle market in exchange. Some have even talked about doing deals to move them in that direction. What's your thought on that and is Aon also doing a similar thing?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Again, we have to start, Paul, with we love the health business. We love the opportunity to serve clients who face increasing pressures that are very real for them on promises they've made to employees about trying to help them serve their family's health needs and the increasing cost of that. Against that backdrop, we provide an absolute large range of solutions. But remember, we actually do regular health benefits for greater than 10 million in the U.S. alone so we actually do more of this than anybody else and love that set of solutions. Exchanges end up being a set of solutions for a subset of that group, like that as well and we've got exchanges, large, medium, small. We've got exchanges that are fully insured and self-insured. So, we actually go through a range of different options depending on the client situation. But in the end, we're addressing the health needs of clients which we believe are going to continue to increase over time. And again, we just love the platform and have been very successful in growing pieces called the exchanges, but also in developing other areas as well.
Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next, we have Brian Meredith of UBS. Your line is open.
Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Yes. Thanks. A couple of questions here. Hey, Greg, back on the healthcare solutions, has the discussion about the potential repeal of the Cadillac tax had any impact on just the large corporate markets and companies thinking about changing, not only to exchanges but other types of plans?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Not really, Brian. I think in the end, it's a great question, but really our clients are really looking at the pressure around cost overall. That could be an accelerant but, frankly, they're feeling the pinch anyway. They're also feeling the pinch around volatility, so it really is how do you help your employees meet their demands, what they need for their family, and do it in a way that's reasonably cost effective, more pressure there, and do it in a way that it's not super-volatile quarter-to-quarter for the company is very, very difficult, and wow. If we'd actually lower the cost curve over time which we've been able to do in the exchange examples, 150, 200 basis points a year, that's hugely positive. So, it really is, that's the dialogue. The Cadillac tax ends up being out there but it really hasn't been a driver.
Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Did you think it'd be a catalyst, though, in the next, call it, next year or the year after as clients potentially face this Cadillac tax if it stays in place?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would say either way it's going evolve because the answer is a good one and it has value and clients see that. Anything by the way that increases cost, the Cadillac tax or anything else, actually is a catalyst for change. So to the extent that's out there and it happens, it's a catalyst for change. To the extent it doesn't, I wouldn't overplay it either. As client see opportunities to reduce costs, flatten the curve and reduce volatility, they're going to embrace it. And I would say, clients that really innovate on the health side drive it. I mean, give an example, we are working with a very well-known new car company who's as excited about innovation and health for their employees as they are about, frankly, changing the way the world buys cars. And against that, we've helped them create a solution that provides transparency, choice, accountability, a whole series of things for their employees. And for them it's as much about innovation and the idea of better health and better wellness as it is about cost. And oh yeah, by the way, you can save and reduce volatility. So, that's really the dynamic that's going on.
Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. And then a quick question on the BPO business, I know margins are pretty low there as you're kind of investing in that business. What are the margins look like right now and then kind of what is the kind of outlook for those margins to kind of improve here? And how much of an impact did that have on the HR Solutions margins overall?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, margins are improving, Brian, but what I would say is we're still at low single-digit margins. As you know, historically, several years ago the margins were negative. So, they have improved but we do believe that we'll move from low single-digit margins to sort of mid-teens margins over time.
Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: How quickly can that happen? I mean, is it just simply just getting rid of some of these investments because they've been – for a long, long time, they have been low.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, we're continuing to improve margins every year, Brian, and clients today are on an average of three-year to seven-year contracts. And so as clients increasingly choose Software-as-a-Service options, our margins improve.
Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Got you. I just thought we might be getting closer to the end of that three years to seven years since when you bought Hewitt.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. It's progressing every year, Brian.
Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Next, we have Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Two quick questions if I can. One, it looks like the average number of employees on the active exchange per company went down significantly. Is that because you're adding smaller companies? Or did any companies from last year did not renew?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: No. Really, this is – again, remember we have been privileged. We've actually brought onboard on the exchange front the largest ever on the exchange. And so almost by definition, as we continue to add clients, the average is going to go down. By the way, the same is true on the retiree exchange where we've added what was the largest client in history on the retiree exchange. So I wouldn't read too much into that. As we add clients, that average is invariably going to come down. We're not too worried about that.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. If there's any – I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: We're still doing, in terms of the category, serving this category we think in a very unique way with a very unique set of options.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. No, that's helpful. Are there any margin implications of adding smaller clients besides the underlying trajectory for improvement?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: No. For us, in the end, we've seen overall positive trajectory as Christa has described before. And we see opportunities here for improvement over time. And again, as I said, fundamentally this is a solution which has actually proved to be quite effective for the category of clients large and medium, and small, in fact. And we're excited about adding clients as it makes sense for them and as they elect to come onboard.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The other thing I would add is because we've created a platform, we're now adding more and more products to be able to offer to employees. We've now got over 11 different products, not just medical, it's medical, dental, vision, short-term disability, long-term disability, pet insurance, and others. And so, it becomes a platform for employees to really have choice as to how they want to invest their dollar.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: And this is consistent on the exchanges, as Christa is describing there with the idea of a platform to serve similar to what we do across the overall health segment, which is really how do we actually serve clients in an effective way across a range of needs beyond a single product. And this just happens to be a platform to do that.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Oh, okay. No, that's very helpful. I appreciate the detail. On a year-to-date basis, I guess organic revenue growth in brokerage, how does that compare to overall global premium growth?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: So, overall, if you sort of look at year-to-date, it kind of give or take 2% overall. That's probably roughly in line, we would sort of say, with overall premium growth globally. What you're getting to there is a great outcome that this really isn't about price. This really isn't about – it's really about underlying demand. Our view is underlying demand in the risk world is going to continue to grow. That's going to be reflected in premiums, which tend to increase year-to-year, and we're roughly in line with that. We're also doing things to bring new categories into play. So, the work we've done, for example, in the reinsurance world, bringing reinsurance capital into the mortgage world actually creates net new markets for what we do overall. That's true in cyber. That's true in terrorism as well. And so for us, we think this is a demand opportunity irrespective of sort of what's happening to the micro price environment and we're seeing it play out over time and we're benefiting from that.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. That is what I was getting at. Thanks so much.
Operator: Next, we have Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: First, I have two questions. First question on the margin. It's pretty good that you can maintain and improve your margin under Risk Solutions given the 1% organic growth. I just wonder what are the driver behind it to be able to better manage expense? And also, so looking longer term, if you look at Risk Solutions, the margin have been stable for about five years and the HR have been stable for four years. So, there's still pretty significant upside to your long-term aspiration goal. I just wonder, if the macro environment remain the same, what other key drivers within your control that we can see meaningful margin expansion in both segments?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think it's a great question, Kai, because one of the things we have been investing in are investments in data and analytics particularly on the risk side. And they are enabling us to drive margin expansion at lower rates of growth. And what you're seeing is, we absolutely invested disproportionately in our data and analytics business, particularly up until 2012. And what you're seeing in 2013, 2014, and 2015 are the return on those investments. And as we think about our margin growth from 22.9% which is where we finished at year-end 2014 to 26%, there are three big drivers of that margin expansion. The first is the return on the investments we've made in data and analytics which are substantial, and you're seeing that drive the majority of our margin expansion in 2013, 2014, and again this calendar year. The second is the Revenue Engine which is allowing us to get record levels of retention of existing clients and record levels of new business wins and you've seen that in our business in calendar year 2015. And the third is the continued expense discipline across our Risk Solutions business. And we are on track for record margins in both segments in 2015.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: And that would be, Kai, at the end of the day, we want to be really clear. Christa has described the track for us to improve margins irrespective of the external environment. So, we didn't talk about pricing, we didn't talk about inflation, we didn't talk about interest rates. We anticipate and expect none of those. If any of those happen, those are substantial accelerants of our margin expansion, but we've been able to expand margin without any of that help with increased operating leverage in the business. So, that's why we are comfortable, and this quarter has done nothing except for reinforce that comfort that we're going to improve margin in 2015, 2016, 2017 irrespective of the external environment.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, to be clear, the pace of the improvements, that is similar to what we have seen in last few years if the environment keeps the same.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We're going to continue to make progress in margin every year.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then my second question is on your capacity for buybacks. So, that (49:47) number is significant this quarter again. And if you're looking forward, if you achieve your $2.3 billion of free cash for 2017, which implies about $300 million year increasing in free cash flow through 2017 from 2014. And then the two variable then to drive your increased buybacks would be the merger and acquisitions as well as the debt. You spoke about the acquisition side, but on the debt side, are there increasing capacity for you to issue on debt. For example, if your EBITDA grew about $100 million a year, would you be able to increase debt by $260 million a year to maintain the 2.6 times leverage ratio, or you want to sort of like keep the debt lower than the leverage ratio going forward?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Kai, It's a great question, and I think gets to the heart of free cash flow growth for Aon and how we allocate capital, and we expect double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2015. We've obviously demonstrated 21% growth in free cash flow in the nine months year-to-date. And we're heading into our seasonally strongest cash flow growth quarter. So, we feel really good about being able to grow free cash flow double-digits this calendar year. And then as we think about the capacity for buyback, you're absolutely right. It's the growth in free cash flow and it's the leverage. And as we think about leverage, we are absolutely committed to our current investment grade ratings and, therefore, as we grow EBITDA and as our pension unfunded liability comes down, we absolutely have the ability to increase leverage. So, that's the way we think about it. And then you could say, are we allocating this capital towards buyback, are we allocating it towards M&A and it's really about how we think about return on capital, which is on a cash-on-cash return. And our highest return on capital use of cash today is buyback. Because we do believe we're substantially undervalued because many people still look at earnings growth and for us there's a very big disconnect between earnings growth and free cash flow growth. And so, you do have double-digit free cash flow growth to deliver $3.3 billion in 2017.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, you're comfortable with the 2.6 leverage ratio at these levels?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, we are.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next, we have Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. Few questions. First on the tax rate. Legacy litigation had a benefit this quarter from the second quarter legacy litigation. Should we expect any kind of benefit on the tax rate in the fourth quarter or will it revert back to around that 19% level?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, the way that works is that legacy litigation that occurred in Q2 that had a positive benefit on the tax rate will impact the full-year tax rate for 2015. So, yes, it will show up again in Q4, Elyse, and then it will not repeat in 2016. And as I've said, the underlying operating rate is 19%, and that's the right rate to use for 2016.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then shifting on to the private healthcare exchanges. The enrollment figures that you gave for 2016, I just want to make sure, are those just on the fully insured exchange? So, the 55 accounts on the active exchange, does that compare to the 30 that you had on last year?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. This is overall sort of what we put on the exchange, Elyse, and it's 1.4 million for 2015 into 2016 just as you described.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then so, what is the – are you breaking out the self-insured versus the fully insured component?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Look at that as an overall. We haven't broken it out explicitly. Basically we increased the number of clients from 30 to 55 on the active exchange. The majority are fully insured, but we also have a number on the self-insured side as well.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then in terms of thinking about the economics, Christa, I know you mentioned that you'll see modest positive earnings this year. When we think through that, is that more of a function of the investments and the expenses on the exchanges going down as it gains greater scale or growth in revenue? What's contributing, which of either revenue or expenses is contributing to you guys kind of hitting the inflection point this year and seeing positive earnings?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Elyse, the way to think about it is the investments we've made are really operating expense, so they're going to show up every year. And then as we get incremental participants enrolled, then our revenue increases which is how we get the scale to be modestly profitable this year and continued improvements in profitability in each year thereafter. So, it's the revenue growth, Elyse.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then lastly on the share repurchases. We saw that pick up this quarter from where you guys have been trending year-to-date? Did you move up any kind of share repurchases that you had geared for the fourth quarter? Anything more on just the pickup in the level in the third quarter and kind of expectations for fourth quarter that you have.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Elyse, what we said coming into the second half of the year was that share repurchase would be stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year because the second half of the year is our seasonally strongest cash flow half. And that's exactly what you're seeing. And so, we would expect – Q4 is our strongest cash flow quarter. And so, if you think about share repurchase going forward, we would expect to continue to allocate capital based on the highest return on capital. And then I would say as you think about sort of hitting the $2.3 billion in free cash flow in 2017, you should assume that the share count is going to continue to trend down over that time period. And so, if you think about the $2.3 billion of cash divided by share count, it is the highest return on capital opportunity we have.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks so much. Just to go back to the cash question again here, I mean, if we go back to 2012 when we sort of laid out the double cash by 2017, I mean, since that point, we've had sort of very clear, tangible drivers of cash generation, the restructuring program, the reduction in pension contributions from freezing the pension plan, and then the reduction in tax payments from the lower tax rate. So, that gets us maybe – depending on what happens this year in the fourth quarter, maybe that gets us halfway there. I guess I'm just trying to understand, looking from here, do we have line of sight into a chart similar like we have on page 11 in the presentation? What gets us the rest of the 50% of the way to that $2.3 billion? Because it's just hard to understand what that is, if it isn't going to be reaching those margin targets that you have guys have laid out specifically by 2017? Thanks.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Look, it's a great question, Michael, because if you look at the pension restructuring CapEx, it's $230 million. You add reduction in cash taxes of about $100 million, you're about $330 million. So, you've got a gap. And the gap is really coming from operating income growth, both in revenue and margin expansion. So, that will be absolutely a big driver of the free cash flow growth. And the second is working capital improvement. Michael, if you look at 2011, our accounts receivable divide by revenue, so you get days sales outstanding. It was about 103 days sales outstanding in 2011. And in 2014, that reduced to 85 days. So, you've basically got an improvement of 18 days in days sales outstanding over those four-year period, which on 2014 revenue is the equivalent of $575 million in cash from working capital. And what I would say is, we've got substantial improvements in working capital to come over the next five-plus years. As we continue to improve the processes around Aon, and through the operating model and improve the collection of cash from customers and the payments to suppliers.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, then, I mean from this point, I mean, it's really less about – or it's going to be less about earnings and margins and more about balance sheet optimization in order to extract that additional $500 million, $600 million of annual cash flow. Is that fair?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, actually. It's really about revenue growth and margin expansion. It's absolutely about operating income growth, so I did start there. So I would say there are two big drivers of cash flow growth other – there are really four big drivers of cash flow growth. One is revenue and margin expansion driving operating income growth. Two is working capital improvements, which we believe is sustainable over multiple years. Three is the reduction in uses of capital on pension restructuring and CapEx. And four is reduced cash taxes. They're the four big drivers, and all four of them will contribute.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Okay. And then, just if I could on healthcare exchanges, tell me you're getting closer to scale there. Do you have visibility or you can give some insight into what the model margins are on exchanges as you think about that relative to your benefits business? I mean, obviously, you've got still some investments in there and you're probably not fully at scale. But how should we think about the trade-off between your sort of legacy benefits business and this new sort of platform as you start to scale that up?
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: As we said before, listen, as we bring this up online, it is going to be higher accretive to our margin currently and certainly helps us and gets us on track and accretive to our 22% target. So, we're investing on behalf of clients. We've absorbing into the P&L. We're still able to improve margins. And as we bring this onboard and we continue to see adoption, it's going to reinforce our overall margin progress and margin improvements.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then, last one on exchanges. I guess ADP is a large payroll company that has talked about building an exchange platform. Do you think – what is the risk, if there is one? Are those potential partners? Are those potential competitors? It's still somewhat unclear about how they're bringing people to the table and partners to the table and potentially competing in the space. How do you think about the potential encroachment either from new competitors or opportunity to partner with new partners like that? Thanks.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Again, we'd step back and say, listen, we're actually operating in the health space, which is why we love the space so much. This is massive, and we would say largely broken. So, this is one of the most important, biggest sectors of the global economy, certainly in the U.S. economy. And our clients are like begging for an option or set of options that can flatten the cost curve a bit, reduce volatility and, most important, give employees better choice and better transparency, and hopefully a bit of accountability, maybe even change their behavior, improve health overall. So, against that backdrop, we've brought a range of solutions. It is a massive, vast ocean with lots of opportunities there. And the thing we love is we start with the fact that we actually already do this for 22 million Americans across the overall benefits spectrum, 10 million in health alone, so we've got very, very tremendous access to the companies to have a great set of discussions. And we would observe, by the way, when we first start talking about exchanges, most of the world said that, no, they don't like them, we should never have them, and then eventually, everybody showed with exchanges. And then we talked about the idea of actually maybe even putting the risk on an insurance balance sheet, let's call it fully insured, and everyone said, no, no, those are terrible, too. And then eventually, everybody's got one of those as well. So, our view is there's going to be lots of folks coming to the floor here to try to serve this market. It's an important market. And at the end of the day, we really – we love our position. We feel very privileged to be where we are. But we also are very clear we need to keep innovating. We need to keep improving. We need to keep investing behind and on behalf of our clients because none of us have gotten our clients to a place where they really need to be going forward and that really is the aspiration.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you so much.
Operator: Our last question is from Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee CRT. Your line is open.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. Just one clarification on the working capital. Christa, if you could help me understand how that works, and I believe you're asking clients to pay up slightly earlier. So, curious about what impact it's having on client relationships and also how much more of this working capital benefits can you squeeze out over the next couple of years?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, really, Vinay, the way this works is it's collecting the cash that customers owe us. And I think historically we've had a focus on revenue growth and then on margin expansion and then really sort of in the last four or five years, cash flow. So, I think we haven't had the discipline around the processes and the collections that we're now putting in place. And I think it's allowing us to translate a dollar of revenue into free cash flow much more efficiently. And so, I would say it's both on that side. And then as we aggregate together our supplier spending, we're able to get better terms in terms of how we pay suppliers. So, both of those contribute to working capital. And I would say as we continue to bring together global Aon and improve our overall efficiency, we see substantial improvements in working capital over the next five years.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: In many respects, Vinay, philosophically to the cash piece, I think it's worth spending a minute on this. Listen, we have brought what we believe is – it's not rocket science but in the world of brokerage, it's an innovation. No one has actually ever looked at the idea of how you translate operating income into cash. And it turns out we're actually not actually squeezing, we're actually just being slightly disciplined. And slight discipline means we've got a better engine to translate operating income into cash. And it turns out, it's massive. And that's why we've actually got a set of structural changes between now and 2013 (1:04:44). Structural intention (1:04:46), structural in restructuring, structural in tax and structural in working capital that again aren't rocket science if you're outside the brokerage world, but in our world require a lot of energy, a lot to change. But when you do, it creates a tremendous benefit. And so, for every dollar of operating profit we're generating, our translation into free cash flow is stronger and getting stronger, and that gets us to the $2.3 billion. I would highlight, as Christa described before, we do not need to get to a 26% margin and a 22% margin in our targets to make $2.3 billion. In fact, if we achieve those margins, we'd be well above $2.3 billion. So, from our standpoint, we're focused on cash because it's important to our investors and important to us. It's an important bellwether on how much we can invest back into the business, and we're taking steps to improve that profile. And the 21% in the first nine months has just said we're on track. And we're going to continue to do that. And I think importantly, as Christa described, we're going to be able to sustain that past 2017 and the $2.3 billion.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. That's helpful. Just one numbers question on the tax rate. Christa, the fourth quarter, should we expect a 16% tax rate once again?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I mean, the operating rate is going to be – the underlying rate is really going to be 19%. And then I think it depends on discrete items and that's what you saw this quarter which made it lower.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would like to turn the call back to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer: Just appreciate everybody joining the call and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may all now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2015 press release, as well as having been posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. And I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First, is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders, and second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to slide three, in the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, with growth across both segments, highlighted by 4% growth in the Americas' retail brokerage business. Operating margin increased 80 basis points reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 5% to $1.31, including $0.08 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, reflecting growth, operating improvement and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow increased 2% to $223 million year-to-date driven by a 10% increase in cash flow from operations, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. Turning to slide four, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, compared to 1% in the prior year quarter, reflecting solid growth across retail brokerage partially offset by a modest decline in Reinsurance. As we discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across retail brokerage. New business generation of more than $216 million across our retail business, 17 consecutive quarters of net new business trends in core treaty reinsurance, an increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology and data and analytics including the Global Risk Insight Platform which now captures over 2.8 million trades and $135 billion of bound premium with more than 40 carriers utilizing the platform today. Review, our reinsurer dashboard, combined with strategic consulting, tells reinsurers to be more effective markets for ceding company clients. And our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to indemnify structured portfolio solutions. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability. Reflecting on the individual businesses within risk solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact on pricing was modestly negative, resulting in continued stable market impact. We saw strong growth across Latin America, reflecting both double-digit new business generation and strong management of the renewal book portfolio. We also generated strong growth across our Affinity business. And in U.S. Retail, we saw solid new business generation with record retention of greater than 93% for the second consecutive quarter. In International, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continue to be stable, and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and pressure in the Pacific region. We saw strong growth across Asia, with double-digit growth in many countries including Hong Kong, China, Japan and Singapore. Results also reflect solid growth in New Zealand, driven by both new business generation and strong management of the renewal book portfolio. In Continental Europe, new business generation continued to be positive. And with strong leadership across the region, we're well positioned to benefit from potential improvements in the macroeconomic environment. In Reinsurance, organic revenue declined 1% compared to a decline of 4% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect a significant unfavorable market impact in the quarter as excess capital in the space continues to pressure global treaty pricing. We saw continued new business generation in treaty placements as clients take advantage of lower pricing by purchasing more coverage and strong growth in facultative placements, partially offset by a decline in capital markets transactions. And while the rate of price decline is decelerated compared to the previous year, a record amount of capital continues to place pressure on the market. And finally, new opportunities for growth combined with industry-leading data and analytics is positioning the business for a return to growth over the next 12 months. Overall, across Risk Solutions, we are on track for low- to mid-single digit organic growth for the full-year 2015 as we continue to drive new business generation, strong retention and take a unified approach to serving clients across the portfolio with industry-leading data and analytics. Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 2%, similar to the prior-year quarter, with growth across both major businesses and in high demand areas where we have invested in innovative solutions and client-serving capability. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership and in-depth understanding and influence of market trends, including continued investment to strengthen our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions, covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies and funding choices from self-insured to fully insured. This includes our industry-leading position in healthcare exchanges for active employees and retirees and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress later this year. Solutions to de-risk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions as clients manage risks against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes. Investment in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business. And finally, we're expanding our international footprint to support a global workforce at the local level, with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets. Turning to individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior-year quarter. We saw continued growth in retirement consulting driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services. Results also reflect solid growth and compensation consulting and modest growth in communications consulting. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter. We saw growth in HR BPO driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. Results also reflect growth in benefits administration driven by demand for discretionary services. Overall, for HR Solutions, we are on track for mid-single digit organic growth for the full year 2015 driven by growth in high demand areas where we made investments as well as leadership across our core businesses. In summary, our industry-leading platform of client-serving capabilities across Risk and HR Solutions combined with investments in data and analytics continues to position the firm for long-term organic growth and improved operating leverage. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning everyone. As Greg noted, our second quarter results reflect double-digit adjusted EPS growth when excluding the impact of FX, driven by organic growth in both Risk and HR Solutions, strong operating margin improvement and effective capital management, including the repurchase of approximately 300 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. Now, let me turn to financial results for the quarter on page six of the presentation. Our core EPS performance excluding certain items increased 5% to $1.31 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.25 in the prior-year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization and legacy litigation expenses relating to events that primarily occurred 10 or more years ago. Further, included in the results was an $0.08 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our core earnings per share in the second quarter would have been $1.39, up 11% from the prior-year quarter. Going forward, if currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a similar impact in Q3 and a lesser impact in Q4 as we continue to work through unfavorable year-over-year headwinds. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 2%. Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 24.2%, and operating income was roughly flat to the prior-year quarter. Operating income included a $26 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, operating income increased 6% compared to the prior-year quarter. Strong operating margin improvement of 150 basis points reflects solid organic revenue growth, return on our investments in data and analytics across the portfolio, and a 60 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, underlying operating margin improved 90 basis points in the quarter. Overall in Q2, we delivered strong underlying operating performance in Risk Solutions despite continued headwinds from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance, fragile market conditions in Europe and historically low interest rates. If interest rates were to rise, we believe we have significant leverage through improving interest rate environment, as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income. For the first six months, operating margin improved 50 basis points with no material impact from foreign currency translation. This places us firmly on track for further margin expansion in 2015 towards our long-term target of 26%, driven by growth, return on investments, and expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate and procurement. Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 2%, operating margin was flat at 13.2% and operating income was also roughly flat to the prior-year quarter. Solid organic revenue growth, expense discipline and a 10 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation were offset by continued investments to support future growth. For the first six months, results reflect modestly better than expected performance. Combined with our outlook for seasonal strength in the second half of the year, we are well on track for improved operating income performance for the full year and further margin expansion towards our long-term target of 22%. Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide nine. Unallocated expenses were flat at $41 million; interest income increased $2 million to $4 million; interest expense increased $3 million to $68 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $1 million primarily includes net gains from certain long-term investments and the sale of certain businesses. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $2 million per quarter of interest income. Interest expense in the third quarter is expected to be approximately $72 million or modestly higher than our run rate due to the overlap of the $600 million of notes placed in May to replace the notes due in September. We would expect interest expense to decline to $68 million per quarter thereafter. Turning to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation, increased to 18% compared to the prior year quarter at 17.5%. The prior-year quarter was favorably impacted by certain discrete tax adjustments. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 286.7 million in the second quarter, compared to 301.6 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased 3 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $300 million in the second quarter. The company has $5.1 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30 were 279.8 million, and there are approximately 7 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q3 2015 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 287 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At June 30, 2015, cash and short-term investments were $851 million. Total debt outstanding increased to approximately $6.1 billion, and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis increased to 2.5 times compared to 2.1 times at March 31, 2015. Cash flow from operations increased 10%, or $32 million, to $365 million driven by decline in pension contributions, restructuring and cash paid for taxes, partially offset by a significant increase in cash paid to settle legacy litigation. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 2% or $5 million to $223 million, reflecting higher cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $27 million increase in CapEx. The anticipated increase in capital expenditure is associated with investment in certain real estate projects as we continue to optimize our real estate portfolio globally. Looking forward, we expect significant free cash flow growth in the second half of the year, leading to double digit growth in free cash flow for the full year 2015 including the legacy litigation impact. The increase in cash paid to settle legacy litigation in the quarter will provide a tailwind to free cash flow growth in 2016. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility and the opportunity to further increase cash flow generation. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of delivering $2.3 billion or more for the full the year 2017. From the graph in the presentation, based on current assumptions, we expect annual free cash flow to increase by approximate $230 million from year-end 2014 to year-end 2017, based only on a reduction in cash used for pensions, restructuring and capital expenditure. Combined with operating improvements in the business, lower cash tax payments and working capital improvements, we have line of sight to achieve our expectations for substantial cash flow generation. Regarding our pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants and frozen plans from accruing additional benefits, and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly $96 million to $220 million in 2015 and continue to decline thereafter. These expectations assume no change in current interest rates. A rise in global interest rates could potentially decrease contributions further. Regarding our restructuring program, cash payments were $82 million in 2014. As all charges related to the restructuring program have now been incurred, we expect cash payments to decline by $49 million to approximately $33 million in 2015 and continue to decline each year thereafter. In summary, we delivered positive performance across each of our key metrics, overcoming a significant headwind from foreign currency translation. We delivered strong underlying earnings growth as we continue to manage expense and create greater operating leverage from our investment in data and analytics. Combined with strong free cash flow growth in the second half and for the full year, we are firmly on track towards our goal of generating more than $2.3 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017. With a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we have positioned the firm for significant shareholder creation in 2015 and beyond. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. One moment please for our first question. Our first question came from the line of Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Hi, Adam.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: On HR Solutions, Christa, you mentioned that you expect solid margin expansion and growth in income. Can we expect just – not exactly – but the range of incremental change we saw in 2014 to be roughly around the same in 2015 for both the margin and income?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We haven't given specific guidance on operating income growth for 2015. What we can say, Adam, is we believe we will deliver mid-single digit revenue growth, operating income growth and margin expansion for the full year, and you've seen us do that in both 2013 and 2014 in HR Solutions and we're well on track to deliver that for 2015.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. And then as far as health exchanges, selling season isn't done yet, but can you comment on, I guess, activity in selling season in 2015 versus 2014? Is activity around the same, better or worse, just as far as the flow of opportunities? And also, how big of a deal is the Cadillac tax in conversations this year?
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, Adam, let's start really with the overall topic here, is really around health solutions when you think about what's out there, and we continue to see strong interest across-the-board, whether they're exchange solutions or bundled solutions for that matter. And this is really across all client segments, needs, et cetera. And so from our standpoint, there's been a lot of interest, continues to be a lot of interest in the pipeline around these sets of discussions. And it really gets to your second part of your question around what's driving it. It's really demand. Overall, health continues to deteriorate a bit and per unit cost healthcare continues to go up. And against that, our clients are struggling to try to deliver for their employees in the best way they possibly can, but also try to bend the cost curve a bit. Cadillac tax is out there on the horizon. One doesn't know exactly how it's going to get resolved, but it certainly represents another piece of potential risk and challenge for them. So all these things are a bit of a catalyst to have clients really try to address these issues and try to understand how they can bring best solutions for it. And from our standpoint, we administer health benefits for 10 million covered lives, 1.2 million of which are on the exchange. By the way, that's self-insured and fully insured. And we see a lot of positive activity against that, and expect that'll continue into 2016, 2017 and 2018 as well
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then finally, I think you mentioned that you expect strong free cash in the back half. Is that, potentially we'll see corresponding pick-up in share repurchase in the back half also?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Next question came from the line of Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Sure.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: I want to start out just, again, kind of focusing a little bit more on the second half. I know we just talked about HR Solutions and organic growth mid-single digits that implies an acceleration. Can you just parse back some of the driver there? Is that some exchange-related activity or other things that you're seeing in the pipeline since the comps are pretty tough year-over-year on that. And then, also, on the other side of the business in Risk Solutions, can you maybe just give us a little bit more of a range of how you're thinking about the organic growth and especially how Reinsurance fits into that? I think I heard you say that you expect growth to improve, but I wasn't really clear if that was more imminent or something a little bit longer term.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So Dave, I'll start on HR Solutions. Our HR Solutions business, the seasonality of that business is always second half weighted and will remain that way for the foreseeable future for us, in both the consulting and the outsourcing businesses. So, in the consulting business, you did see a change in patterning last year, particularly around compensation consulting. And so, you'll see that happen predominantly in the second half of the year. And then obviously, on the outsourcing side, our healthcare exchange business is a much more Q4-weighted activity. And so the patterning you saw in 2014 and 2013 will repeat in 2015, meaning the revenue growth is much more second half weighted. So, that definitely is why we feel very good about the growth in the second half of the year, and we can see that in our pipeline today. On the Risk side, I would say similarly, we feel really good about the Risk growth. And we're on track for low- to mid-single digits in Risk Solutions overall. And as Greg said, Risk growth in the first half of 2015 was better than Risk growth in the first half of 2014. And so, we're well on track to deliver great growth across Risk Solutions.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: I wouldn't add much to that, David. If you think about the quarter, Christa was describing, we essentially – it's another of quarter progress. Our view is we're going to deliver exactly – nothing has happened in the first half of the year that changes our view for the full year, so this is a low- to mid-single-digit range. I would say from an Aon Benfield standpoint, you'll note my comments, I said this is a sector that obviously has been under some pressure given, frankly, our tremendous position in it and the price pressure that's been on it. But we've talked about this segment returning to growth in 2016, and we anticipate it's going to do that, and also see a number of the investments we've made in the business to create operating leverage, in fact, doing exactly that. So, I'd point to the 4% organic in the Americas, and in particular, the U.S. number, around 93% retention for the second consecutive quarter. This is actually tremendous progress and we think that's going to continue. All these things are to just underscore and increase our confidence, and our ability to deliver the growth targets we talked about at the beginning of the year.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Excellent. That's helpful. And then maybe just piggybacking off the Risk conversation there, maybe it's attributable to the higher retention as well of some of the programs that have been going on and investing in, but the margins were up very nice year-over-year, I think, 150 basis points to 90, excluding FX. Can you spike out anything unusual one-timers either last year to remind us or this year besides the core improvement that you're doing? And on the core side, is that more of a function of the Aon Broking initiative or the revenue engine to get a higher share of wallet? Or are there other contributors that are helping just strictly on the operating expense side?
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yeah. The key message, I think, you started with is foremost here, which is we will continue to invest in the business, improve operating leverage, and increase margins as a result of that. And we're able to do that if – at each incremental level of growth – and you're seeing us actually play that out. We'd highlight, by the way, this is about a year for us. It's not about a single quarter. On a single quarter, 150 basis points is correct, but by the way, we'd back out all the FX pieces against it and say it's closer to 90 basis points for the quarter, but really 50 basis points for the first half. So, our view is we're making good, solid progress on margin improvement. We are going to continue to do that through the course of 2015. And what this quarter did was, it didn't change our expectation, just reinforced our ability to do that on our march toward 26%.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then lastly, just on the free cash flow. You're obviously reaffirming that for 2017, and that's in light of the FX headwinds and the challenging macro backdrop when you initially set the guidance. I'm wondering relative to your initial expectations, have you had material upside to what you were originally thinking? And I'm also wondering how bad conditions might need to get for you to fall short of that free cash flow goal. In other words, maybe you can give us a little more color about the assumptions for organic growth, FX and margin expansion within that, for 2017.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Certainly. And so we feel really confident about our ability to deliver on the $2.3 billion-plus of free cash flow in calendar year 2017. And there are really four big drivers of that: continued organic growth and margin expansion of the business; declining cash contributions to pension; restructuring and tax; and then improvements in working capital. And we feel really good about the improvements we're making in the first half of 2015 with 2% growth in free cash flow. And we're on track to do double-digit free cash flow growth in 2015 including the litigation settlements, and we'll have extremely strong cash flow growth in 2016 and 2017. So we feel really good about the path there.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: And in respect – if you think about the quarter – the new news for the quarter is this continued positive sort of progress on the cash-generating capability, as Christa's describing. So, overall, top-line revenue, exactly where we thought it would be, same with margin but the cash flow generating engine against all the headwinds you've highlighted, candidly, continues to strengthen, and we see that continuing through 2015 and in 2016 and 2017.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Sarah Dewitt of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Hi, Sarah.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: On the share buybacks, how should we think about the pace of that for the rest of the year, and should the full year 2015 be lower than the full year 2014 given where we're running year-to-date?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. So, full year 2015 share repurchase should be lower than 2014 because if you recall, Sarah, there were two unusual sort of sources of cash, which contributed to higher than normal share repurchase than 2014. The first was we had $300 million of excess cash on the balance sheet at year-end 2013, which we used in share repurchase in the first quarter of 2014. And the second was we increased leverage during the year by $1.1 billion. And so, share repurchase for the full year 2015 will be lower, but as I described earlier, I think our cash flow is seasonally higher in the second half of any calendar year, and therefore we expect stronger share repurchase in the second half of the year.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. And then on the private health exchanges, could you just talk a little bit qualitatively how the selling season is going? It sounds like we're hearing from others that maybe some large employers might be deferring, or you might be seeing more adoption on self-insured exchanges versus fully insured. So if you could talk about any of those trends, that'd be helpful.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yeah, we would say overall, Sarah, as I mentioned before, really for us this is about a comprehensive set of health solutions – and those conversations be they fully insured exchanges, self-insured exchanges, traditional self-insured bundles, the intensity of those discussions has remained very, very strong and continue into 2015 and we anticipate into 2016 and 2017. And the pipeline continues to be also quite strong across the board. But again, we're building a long-term platform here and for us it's not – it's even not as much about the selling season as it was before because we're seeing more clients talk about off-cycle adoption and the different solutions. What the clients are looking for is a way, a solution to try to manage against what is an increasing level of costs and a set of promises they made to employees that they really want to keep, and we're trying to help them do that. So the intensity of those conversations and the opportunity, candidly, for us to help them solve and address those issues continues to be very strong.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question came from the line Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. My first question, I guess, going back to the HR Solutions segment. Through the first half of the year, the earnings in that segment seems to be trending better than you planned. Was there anything kind of seasonal or one-off in the Q2? And then, does that kind of change your outlook for where you were thinking about that business at the start of the year, maybe expecting stronger growth in the second half?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Great question, Elyse. I think we had originally guided to down in operating income in the first half of the year and up in the second half of the year, so strong operating income growth for the full year 2015. And I think the first half of the year was slightly better than our expectations. And I think we are still on track for exactly what we guided for the full year, so I wouldn't change our full-year guidance at all. I think it was just slightly better and I wouldn't point to any significant items. There was a range of smaller things that were slightly better than we expected.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then on the tax rate, the adjusted rate was about 18% in the quarter, and when we think of – actually, it was down from that 19% that you guys had kind of pointed to. In terms of modeling for the tax rate going forward, would you change from the 19% or is there anything that kind of lowered that slightly in the quarter?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Great question, Elyse. Ongoing operational rate remains at 19%, subject to discrete tax adjustments. We did have some positive discrete tax adjustments in Q2, which made the rate lower than that 19% guidance, but that is exactly where we remain.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then back on Risk Solutions, in terms of you guys kind of pointed to what seems like a little bit of improvement in organic revenue growth in the back half of the year since you did say Reinsurance has most likely declined until we hit 2016, what type of improvement are you expecting in the retail, I guess, from the about 2% growth we've seen in the first half of the year?
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yeah. Elyse, we're still similar – this is similar to the HR Solutions story. We're exactly in the same place around – an expectation for the year around low- to mid-single digit organic growth on the Risk side. And again, what we said is what this quarter did was just reinforce our confidence in the ability to achieve that. And then I pointed the longer term trends on the Reinsurance side, where we really see this business returning to growth in 2016. But our 2015 expectations remain exactly the same. Again, with the new news of the quarter being just a reinforcement of the cash generating engine of Aon and how it's evolving.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then lastly, on the private health care exchanges, we've seen an acquisition announced recently between Willis and Towers Watson. Do you expect there to be, I guess, any impact on what you're doing on the private health care exchange front from those two companies getting together?
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: I would say from our stand and point of view, if you think about the overall events, recent events really across the board not just in our space but in the markets as well, again, we see them as reinforcing and in many respects making more relevant the strategy we put in place and we've been pursuing, really, for the last 10 years. If you think about industry consolidation, M&A, the risk markets, the health markets, consolidation and intermediaries, as well as the challenges, frankly, our clients are facing in things like cyber globalization, all these things have puts and takes. No doubt about it. But when you put them together, the overall sum, in our view, they reinforce our strategy to be the preeminent firm focused on risk and people. On the consolidating intermediaries from our standpoint, highlights the recognition by other players in our space, they're seen exactly today what we saw 10 years ago. And we've been investing behind it for the last decade and we believe the trends are real and make great opportunities for all of us. And on the consolidating market side, that's out there both on the health and the risk side, we see this as a great opportunity to bring better and more relevant solutions to our clients. So, in many respects, we see change as opportunity, and we're very well positioned to take advantage of it.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Next question came from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Your line is now open.
Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. A couple of quick questions here for you all. The first one, Christa, the cash impact of the litigation charge in the quarter was the same as the earnings impact?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Not exactly. There's some timing elements of that. So, I think the cash impact, I'd think about over the course of the full year. You've got, obviously, tax affects the expenses that we've got there.
Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Any guidance just so I know what the impact on free cash flow was in the quarter, just for modeling purposes?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, the way I'd think about it is, for the full year, just use the after-tax impact of the costs.
Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: For the full year. Okay. Great. And then the second question, on the exchanges, just what does the consolidation we're seeing in the healthcare insurance industry mean for your exchange? I know – because a big part of it is the competition and them lowering the prices.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, Brian, from our standpoint, as I said – just alluded to – for us, capability on the market side, the carrier side, creates greater opportunity that we can bring on behalf of our clients. What I'll highlight on the active side, we've got 30 national regional carriers sort of in the mix on the exchange side, and 90-plus carriers in the mix under retiree side. So, for us it's not about that individual level of competition, we're creating that. That's going to be there. It's really more around fundamental capability and what these institutions bring to the table, and we anticipate it's going to be stronger. And to the extent there are three on the health side that's greater than $100-billion-plus – I'm assuming all those go through in the way planned – I'm sure they're going to be competing very, very strongly with greater capability. And we think that's going to bode well for our clients and again, change and movement in the market actually benefits us tremendously if we're capable of bringing good solutions to our clients.
Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then Greg the last question, I'm just curious. There's always obviously competition for good talent within the insurance brokerage industry. Are you seeing any pickup of late? I mean, we've seen some fairly significant movements in the reinsurance brokerage area and some other companies talking about trying to invest in the business. Is there any pickup right now do you think in the competition for talent?
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Brian, I really don't see it. This is – we always want to be the best place possible – where someone can come and develop as a professional, support (36:32) and serve clients. And we've been talking about this for a long, long time. It's been part of our strategy for the last 10 years, and we've seen opportunity over that entire period of time. And sometimes it intensifies, sometimes it wanes a bit, but it's really been a constant. And the M&A activity obviously creates different opportunities, but I wouldn't overplay it. For us we're going to go after the best talent in the world to support our clients and that's not going to change for Aon.
Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for the answers.
Operator: Thank you. Next question came from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Pardon me. Thanks. Good morning. Greg, you talked about tuck-in acquisitions being done. Can you give us an update in terms of whether the pricing for the acquisitions that you're looking at, whether that pricing is changing at all?
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: I would say, Meyer, for us, the overall marketplace continues to be very, very competitive. There's a lot of capital out there looking at different opportunities. For us, as Christa well described, we remain constant here, too. Our view is around return on invested capital. We're maniacally focused on bringing capability in Aon in a way that improves and then strengthens our return on invested capital. Christa talked about what we're doing with buyback. That's always a benchmark for us. We've got to be able to beat that from a return on invested capital standpoint and that's how we think about our acquisitions. And we see a very competitive market, but we also see opportunity, lots of different firms want to be part of a firm that can actually, truly change the course of a client's performance and do this on a global basis. And this is, in many respects, again, back to the destination of choice for talent, it's back to Brian's question a little bit. We can be a very attractive place for those types of colleagues and for those types of firms. And we're seeing that as well.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then real quickly in the slides, the uses of cash slide no longer refers to 2018. And I was hoping you could take us through why – how that decision was made?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think it's really just focused on 2017 because we've set a very specific goal of $2.3 billion of free cash flow. So, I think it was just more around reinforcing that, Meyer.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. So, no change to the expectation beyond?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: No.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question came from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you. So, first question to follow up on the merger acquisition. You have been, say, five years since your large acquisition of Hewitt back in 2010. I just wonder, are you interested or open to any big or transformative transactions that could enhance your franchise?
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: So Kai, for us, again, we – it's been the same strategy and approach – preeminent firm in the world focused on risk and people. And we talked about categories around risk, retirement, health, talent, capital, et cetera. It's been a strategy we've worked on very, very hard. And we continue to add content capability around it both in organic investment, which you see us make quite substantially, exchanges, risk insight platform, review, et cetera. And then, we add content, capability in the form of M&A when they can actually help us strengthen that platform. By the way, back to the question before around, it's got to be – got to meet our return on invested capital requirements. And so, you'll see us kind of in the $200 million to $400 million, $500 million a year, bringing in capability like that around the world, but we really like the platform we've got at this point, and that's what we're focused on.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then in the past, I remember you talked about your private exchange platform that' basically, you had said, multi-carrier and fully insured. But in the commentary, it looks like you also mentioned about health insurer. Are you sort of like open – basically, is there – change your like platform philosophy with regarding like either like self-insured or fully insured.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yeah. Really – Kai, there's really no change at all here. Again, step back, this has really always been about the category of health for us. And in that category, we administer benefits for 10 million covered lives, so virtually more than anybody else in the world. It was within that context that we brought about a fully-insured, multi-carrier exchange. But we also have a full range and complement of self-insured exchanges, and a full range and complement of bundled solutions for large market, middle market, small commercial companies. So for us, it's about a range of health solutions, fully insured being one innovation in the context of that. And that's really what's been the focal point from the beginning.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And last question is, could you talk a bit more about your investments in the so-called cloud-based solutions in Outsourcing business and what's the potential growth or maturity there?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. And you saw that, obviously, Kai, during the quarter, we saw great growth in our cloud-based solutions and HR Solutions. As you know, we invested in two of the largest Workday implementation firms in the world – OmniPoint in 2012 in the U.S. and then the largest EMEA implementation firm called Cloud in Q1 this year – and that's enabling us to fast-forward that (41:21) growth. It's really addressing the client need around getting better data on their people and driving analytics to help them manage their – one of their most important assets – their people much more efficiently and much more effectively. And we're seeing clients increasingly choose cloud-based solutions which is driving substantial growth for us.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Are those better margin business than traditional base, say, software-on-premise business?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, one of the efficiencies of that business model is it is much better margin for the clients and it's better margin for us, too.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Well, thank you so much for all the answers.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Next question came from the line of Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. You may proceed, sir.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Greg, just one, just clarification. You mentioned in Reinsurance that data and analytics would help reignite growth next year. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of what you mean underneath that and kind of what opportunities you see for you to be able to leverage your analytics in order to kind of reassert growth despite sort of market conditions?
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yeah. So, a couple of things going on, Mike, just to be aware of. Again, if you think about where we are in Aon Benfield, first, you understand the position of having – we have a very privileged position that our colleagues have built over time – number one in treaty, substantially number one in facultative, number one in capital markets and what we do there in alternative capital. And against that, obviously, we've addressed some substantial headwinds in the treaty world, where particularly in cat, it's under pressure. And by the way, that's when the price has been under most pressure. It's against that, that, before we get to any analytics that the team with what the capability we've got, has been positive for 17 consecutive quarters on net new business. So the underlying health of this business has actually been strengthening over time. And so, start with that. So, as the price declines begin to decelerate, which they have – still there, still substantial – that actually bodes very well for what the underlying impact is going to be long-term. Equally or more exciting is really what we're doing in terms of sort of finding new markets and new ideas to deploy capital, and this is really where some of our analytics comes in. So, for example, we have done some very innovative work in the mortgage arena in which we brought insurance capital, reinsurance capital into the mortgage world. That's never have done before, and created some price transparency and some value from that standpoint that just – it's really a net new area in many respects, by the way. The demand growth, by the way, is about $6 billion in limit a year, which frankly, we haven't seen anything like in the industry since the 1990s. So, for us, we're doing things that actually create net new opportunity. And then, much like we did with Risk Insight Platform in the primary space, we've done with something called Review, which actually helps insurers and reinsurers actually operate much better in the marketplace and understand where they can apply their capital and create better returns. So, for us, it's really threefold. One is just the basic core business and what we're doing to win new clients; and then it's creating new markets, the example I just gave you in mortgage; and then it's actually helping our clients to actually perform better on the Reinsurance side using data analytics like Review. So, a range of things we're doing here that we think bode well for the future.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Appreciate that. That's very helpful answer. Thank you for that. And then, on these exchanges – and maybe I just don't remember – but I had thought that most of the employers you guys had added, the large employers you've added, had been on a fully insured basis. I wasn't aware that you had begun offering a self-insured option, and so I'm just curious, have you been adding employers to that platform? And if so, just if we can get some idea of where you are in terms of building out the scale there? Thanks.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yeah. Yeah. For us, Mike, it's always been about a range of health solutions. The confusion comes about because we believe we brought forward the first ever fully insured multi-carrier exchange for big companies. And so, we are the only ones adding to that because we really – no one had a solution for a period of time. In fact, many actually were pushing against the whole exchange idea, and then when we start to do that, everyone loves the exchange idea. So, there's a bit of a semantics back and forth. For us, it's been about a range of solutions both fully insured, which we're adding clients to. Depending on funding mechanism, some like the credit, creates a choice, and to create a different funding mechanism around self-insured, we're happy to do that, too. And then others will say, no, let's stay with the traditional bundled solution. And then I'd remind you again, that's 10 million covered lives for us. So, most of anybody. So that's what we've been doing forever. So, for us, it's about a range of solutions, one piece of which has been an important new innovation called fully insured multi-carrier.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. But so, the most recent update you gave us on the 700,000 or so lives on active exchanges, so that's split up between fully insured and self-insured?
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: No, in this case, that was largely that we wanted to try to highlight the fully insured piece across the board, and that was, again, 1.2 million lives across the exchanges. On the active side, approaching 1 million lives, 33 clients, et cetera. That was really fully insured multi-carrier, so we could highlight that. In the fullness of time, we're going to talk about a range of solutions beyond just fully insured. But, again, that was the innovation in the marketplace that no one else had seen, which is why we wanted to highlight it and -
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: – put a spotlight on it, so you can see what it looked like.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Makes sense. And then just last one if I could for Christa. The cash flow element, I mean, looks like, so – looks like if you guys hit your margin targets that you've outlined in the slide – it seems pretty clear that you can get to that sort of cash flow projection that you've talked about in 2017. Is that what we should be thinking about? And if not, could you give us some idea in terms of magnitude, order of magnitude, what's going to drive us getting from cash flow generation at this point to the sort of numbers, the $2.3 billion that you guys are talking about? And thank you for all the answers. Appreciate it.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Michael, I think as we think about getting to the $2.3 billion in free cash flow by 2017, we have four big drivers of getting there. The first is the revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is the decreased use of cash on pension and restructuring. The third is decreased use of cash on taxes and the last is improved working capital. And so, I think it's – there are sort of four big drivers that we've outlined in the presentation that really get us to that $2.3 billion level. And I guess what I would say on margins is that we're going to continue to progress in margin expansion in both segments, as you've seen historically. And so we'll continue to make progress.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And do you expect pensions and taxes to continue to contribute, or should we expect that – I mean, it looks like a lot of that may be behind us or maybe a little bit still left, but – so is it margin and then working capital that's going to get us from where we are to there, or is there – is it fair to think about it that way? Or is there another – ?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I would say that pension and restructuring, we still have further upside, and you can see that in the slides in the presentation. It was about $230 million, I think, of cash upside between year-end 2014 and year-end 2017 on just pension and restructuring – pension restructuring and CapEx, actually. And so, there's definitely an upside there. I think as we finish 2015, our cash tax sort of effective rate will have matched our effective tax rate. And so you should really say that we've level set on cash taxes at that point, so that's really sort of where we are on cash taxes. And then from there on, the primary drivers of free cash flow growth will be revenue growth and margin expansion and working capital improvements.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Next question came from the line of Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Good morning. I just want a follow-up question on sort of the M&A take that you have. In the reinsurance market, in particular, do you think that there'll be a difference in demand given what's happening from the consolidations
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, the ebb and flow of it, Paul, in the short term, you can understand sort of how people have different views on demand, but those will be phased in over time. Fundamental though is asking the question, what's the return on invested capital of these institutions and can we bring solutions to them to help improve that? And for us, that's always been the thesis, and that's why we love the space so much. Our view is there's many, many companies here, and they have tremendous opportunity to improve return on invested capital. And whether we're bringing them solutions that is basically treaty placement, facultative placement, alternative capital or, frankly, more and more back to the question from earlier, data and analytics that help them understand their business so they can make better decisions to improve operating performance, strengthen their balance sheet or reduce their volatility, all these things for us make this highly attractive and an area of high demand. And all the M&A does is create change as we've described before, which will have, as I before, puts and takes, but net-net, we believe bodes very well for someone with real capability and who's made substantial investment over time to try to come up with solutions, a la on Aon Benfield.
Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Fair enough. And then, do you think there'll be any change as well in the relationship between carriers and brokers at the high end that you're at?
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Say a little more about that. What are you thinking about?
Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Well, I'm just curious if – historically, the brokers have had, frankly, the lion's share of the control over the negotiations between carriers and – over things like relationships, commissions, whatnot. But we're seeing some very large consolidation at the high end, and I'm just curious as you'll think – if you see the carriers in the future trying to demand more (51:23).
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, we don't see much change. I mean, carriers, by the way, have always been demanding and we'd expect them to be and we want them to be on behalf of – they're actually trying to protect and support their shareholders. Our mission and our maniacal focus is on our clients. And so, we're always looking for better solutions on behalf of our clients. That's not going to change in any way, shape or form and we're going to continue to try to strengthen our capabilities to deliver that. And as I said before, we actually like the idea of some of these larger institutions with greater capability. But I love the idea of sitting across the table from a Fortune 10 Company and talking about bringing greater than $1 billion limits on behalf of cyber. What a great opportunity that would be, or greater limits than that. So, for us, we see tremendous opportunity here, and think it's going to continue to evolve in this direction. And consolidation will have, as I said before, some puts and takes but net-net, we think very positive.
Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Thank you and congratulations in the quarter.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question came from the line of Jay Cohen of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. A question on the International side. Overall, International growth was, I guess, okay but not terribly good. You highlighted a couple of areas where you were growing, but there must be some areas that are holding back that growth. What are those areas that are a bit more challenged now, Greg?
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yeah. So, Jay, from our standpoint, as we said before, really if you think about what we've produced and outcomes on the Risk Solutions side overall, have been really in face of some headwinds as we talked about in Aon Benfield and in International. And we've got some great, great spots I've described before really across Asia – I highlighted them on my comments. I won't repeat them now – but really a number of different places. But if you think about Europe, Europe really is – you've got a lot of challenges in specific countries across Europe. And the good news is we've got incredibly strong privileged positions that go back decades – more than, literally hundreds of years, quite literally – and we believe we're very well positioned as that, the economics, the economy changes over time. But in the near term, they represent some challenges and that's really been the headwinds.
Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks, Greg.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: Sure.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Jay.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director: I just want to say thanks to everyone for joining the call and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect at this time. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded, that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2015 results, as well as having been posted to our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today, and consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover three areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is overall organic growth performance; and third, continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margin, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 3, in the first quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall with solid growth across both segments and highlighted by 4% growth in the Americas Retail Brokerage and HR Outsourcing businesses. Operating margin decreased 50 basis points as underlying operational improvement in both segments was more than offset by a significant unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, primarily in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 7% to $1.37 including a $0.15 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, reflecting underlying operational improvement, other income gains and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow growth increased $140 million, driven by a substantial increase in cash flow from operations. Overall, results reflect a solid start to the year overcoming a significant challenge from foreign currency, driven by organic revenue growth across Risk and HR Solutions, underlying operational improvement, effective capital management, and substantial free cash flow generation. We are well on track for continued improvement in 2015 and for further progress against our long-term goals. Turning to slide four, on the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth across Retail Brokerage, partially offset by a modest decline in Reinsurance. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening the underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage. With management of the renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, highlighted by near record levels of retention of greater than 93% in U.S. Retail. New business generation of more than $220 million across our Retail business, highlighted by double-digit new business growth in many countries across Latin America, Asia and emerging markets. In our core treaty Reinsurance business, net new business trends reached record levels in Q1 and have been positive for 16 consecutive quarters. An outstanding performance in today's challenging marketplace that reflects Aon's Benfield long-term value proposition for clients and the application of excess capital in the industry to previously uninsured risk. An increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology, and data and analytics with the growth of GRIP [Global Risk Insight Platform], Review and Aon Broking. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4%, similar to the prior-year quarter. Exposures continued to be positive across the region while the impact from pricing was flat, resulting in continued stable market impact. We saw solid growth across all regions: U.S. Retail, Latin America and Canada; and continued growth across all business lines; Property and Casualty, Health and Benefits, and Affinity. In U.S. Retail, as I mentioned earlier, we delivered retention rates near record levels, greater than 93%, driven by strong management of the renewal book portfolio. Results in the quarter also reflect double-digit new business growth in Latin America and Canada. In International, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior-year quarter. Exposures continued to be stable, and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and pressure in the Pacific Region. We saw strong growth across Asia and emerging markets and solid growth in New Zealand, driven by new business generation and strong management of the renewal book portfolio. Results in the quarter also reflect solid new business generation in Continental Europe, and excellent results in the region as we are well positioned to benefit from potential improvements in the macroeconomic environment across Continental Europe. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was minus 1% against a strong comparable of 3% in the prior-year quarter. Excess capital in the space continues to pressure global treaty pricing, most notably in the Americas, driving a significant unfavorable market impact in the quarter. Results reflect near record levels of new business in treaty placements as well as modest growth in facultative placements, partially offset by a modest decline in capital markets transactions. While the rate of price decline has decelerated compared to the previous year, a record amount of capital continues to place pressure on the market. As a result, clients are beginning to buy more coverage and record capital is being deployed to new markets. New opportunities for growth combined with industry-leading data and analytics continues to position the business for long-term growth despite current industry conditions. Overall, across Total Risk Solutions we delivered solid growth in the quarter and are well on track for low to mid-single-digit organic growth in 2015 as we continue to drive new business and take a unified approach to serving clients across the portfolio despite continued pressure in Reinsurance. Turning to HR Solutions, organic revenue growth was 4% with growth across both major businesses and in areas where we're making investments in the business including healthcare exchange solutions, Cloud-based outsourcing solutions, pension risk and delegated investment solutions. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding and influence of market trends, and solutions to sustainably address the long-term issues that face our clients such as healthcare reform, as healthcare costs and the associated financial risks continue to rise at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations delivered at the local level. Managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes. Finally, software-as-a-service models are quickly emerging as attractive platforms for companies as they provide the latest technology, access to upgrades and a flexible pricing model with minimum investment in technology infrastructure. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. We saw continued strong growth in U.S. Retirement primarily from demand for pension de-risking and lump sum window activity along with continued growth in delegated investment consulting. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in Retirement Solutions in Continental Europe. For the full year we expect mid-single digit organic revenue growth across Consulting Services. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 4%, compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. Organic revenue reflects growth in our healthcare exchange business from follow-on enrollments and additional off cycle wins on the retiree exchange. The follow-on retiree enrollments that took place in the first quarter are expected to renew during the normal Q4 enrollment period in the upcoming years, returning to normal seasonality of the healthcare exchange revenue. Results also reflect new client wins in HR BPO, as an increasing number of clients are adopting cloud-based outsourcing solutions. Overall, for HR Solutions, we delivered improved organic revenue growth in the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect continued performance to be driven by growth in high demand areas where we've made investments, as well as leadership across our core businesses and are on track for mid-single digit organic growth in 2015. Slide 5 highlights the third topic: areas of investment. Aon has a unique and strong track record of developing innovative solutions, self-solve problems and creates differentiated value in response to specific client needs. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. These investments have enabled and are expected to continue to enable Aon to drive sustainable long-term growth while building operating leverage into the business. Aon's industry-leading platform continues to evolve to address clients' changing needs and strategic priorities with innovative, first to market solutions and unmatched advisory capability. A few examples include: in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership with a firm-wide rollout of Aon Client Promise, a unified approach to client service across Aon to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We're investing in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's largest leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, now capturing nearly 2.7 million trades and $119.5 billion of bound premium across 65 lines of business. We continue to have a growing list of carriers utilizing the platform of which nearly half have signed multi-year contracts, and an increasing number of clients are also adding strategic consulting services to their annual contract fee. In addition, we're driving our AON Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions. We're investing in the continued development of data and analytics capability at Aon Benfield to strengthen an already industry-leading value proposition and client-serving capability. A great example of this is Aon Benfield Review, a reinsurer dashboard and strategic consulting approach to help insurers be more effective as they approach markets for ceding and ceding company clients. We continued to align our global health and benefits platform to capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities in an area that is high growth in nearly every region around the world. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients. In HR Solutions, we're investing to address high growth areas. We're expanding solutions to de-risk pension plans and support increasing needs for delegated investment solutions, which fulfill our clients' needs for faster execution of their investment strategies. Aon Hewitt is able to offer a differentiated strategy based on our three pillars: of actuarial expertise, investment solutions, and pension administration. We're also providing the broadest set of health, retirement, and talent and advisory advocacy solutions to our clients' employees and retirees to enable greater choice and improved decision making. As part of our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies and funding choices, we continue to make investments to support future growth and strengthen our industry-leading position in health exchanges for active employees and retirees. Our third year enrollment results on the active exchange have underscored the long-term sustainability of private exchanges. Well-designed exchanges can be a better way to offer health benefits by delivering on their promise to engage consumers, offer broad choice, and control costs for employers. As noted last quarter, for clients going through their second year renewal, the average cost increase was 2.6%, including administration fees and costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, which compares favorably to industry data reflecting the average healthcare cost increase for self-insured large U.S. employers was approximately 6% to 8%. Equally important, client satisfaction for the enrollment period was outstanding for the second consecutive year with 87% of employees having liked the ability to choose among multiple carriers. Carrier satisfaction was also strong with 80% of employees giving their medical carriers a four or five-star rating Overall, our extensive portfolio of health solutions continues to drive strong client interest and demand with both exchange and bundled solutions that cover all client segments and needs in an evolving healthcare landscape. We also continue to invest in our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and consumer technology platforms, including extensive mobile solutions and Cloud-based outsourcing solutions. In Q1, we completed the acquisition of the UK-based Kloud, the largest dedicated workday consultancy firm outside the U.S. With this transaction, Aon Hewitt becomes the largest provider of workday services in Europe, and is fully resourced to deliver results for multinational clients, as one of the world's largest workday providers. Finally, we're expanding our international footprint to support a global workforce, with key investments in talent capabilities across emerging markets. In summary, our first quarter reflects a solid start to the year driven by underlying operational performance and investments in innovative client-serving capabilities. Looking forward, we expect continued progress throughout the year, as we position the firm for sustainable long-term growth, increased operating leverage and significant free cash flow generation toward our goal of $2.3 billion or more for the full year 2017. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect the solid start to the year, overcoming a significant headwind from foreign currency translation. We delivered solid organic growth in Risk and HR Solutions, underlying operational improvement, monetized unproductive capital and drove working capital improvement, resulting in strong earnings growth. We also delivered significant free cash flow growth which enabled the repurchase of 250 million of ordinary shares in our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter, and the announcement of a 20% increase to the annual dividend, subsequent to the close of the quarter. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page six of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 7% to $1.37 per share for the first quarter, compared to $1.28 in the prior-year quarter. Included in the results was a $0.15 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, earnings per share in the first quarter would have been $1.52, up 19% from the prior-year quarter. These results reflect strong operational and financial performance, overcoming an anticipated unfavorable impact due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies, most notably the euro, which weakened 17% versus the prior-year quarter. Impact from anticipated weakness in the euro was compounded by the seasonal strength of our EMEA business in Retail Brokerage, as the majority of our corporate renewals take place in the first quarter Going forward, if currency were to remain stable at today's rates the impact will be substantially less than the headwind in the first quarter as we now expect a modest unfavorable impact in each quarter, principally in Q2 and Q3, as rates have continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar since our previous guidance. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 23.2% and operating income decreased 6% versus the prior year quarter. Included in the quarter was a significant unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $50 million, or minus 60 basis points. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, operating margin increased 20 basis points to 23.8% and operating income increased 4% versus the prior-year quarter. Underlying results reflect solid organic revenue growth and a return on our investments in data and analytics, such as GRIP and Aon Broking. Overall, in Q1, we delivered solid underlying operating performance in Risk Solutions, despite continued headwinds from a significant unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance. We are firmly on track for improved operating income performance and further margin expansion in 2015, towards our long-term target of 26% driven primarily by the return on investments and expense discipline, as we optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate and global procurement. Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 4%. Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 13.2% and operating income was flat to the prior-year quarter. Solid organic revenue growth in the quarter was more than offset by a $6 million, or minus 20 basis points, unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and investments to support future growth. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 13.4% and operating income increased 5% versus the prior-year quarter. Our first quarter results were exactly in line with expectations and management's guidance previously provided to the HR Solutions business, of down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, resulting in improved operating income performance for the full year and further margin expansion toward our long-term target of 22%. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide nine. Unallocated expenses increased $4 million to $47 million. Interest income increased $1 million to $3 million. Interest expense increased $7 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $42 million primarily includes $23 million of gains due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the re-measurements of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and certain transactional FX hedging activity to help mitigate an anticipated unfavorable translation impact. It also includes $19 million of net gain on the sale of certain businesses. The gains resulting from the sale of certain businesses reflect our intent to continue to monetize to optimize the portfolio around the highest return on capital as well as monetization of unproductive capital. Going forward we expect a run rate of $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $2 million per quarter of interest income and $68 million per quarter of interest expense. Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 19.1%, similar to the prior-year quarter at 18.9%. Lastly, diluted shares outstanding decreased to 287.1 million in the first quarter compared to 307.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The company repurchased 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $250 million in the first quarter. The company has $5.4 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on March 31 were 281.7 million and there are approximately 7 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2015 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 288.5 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At March 31, 2015 cash and short-term investments were $721 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.7 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.1 times, similar to December 31, 2014. Cash flow from operations increased $147 million to $136 million in our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter driven by a decline in pension contributions, working capital improvements, and a decline in cash paid for taxes and restructuring. Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased $140 million to $74 million reflecting significantly higher cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $7 million increase in CapEx. As discussed previously, we expect significant free cash flow growth to continue in 2015 driven by operational and working capital improvements, uses of cash for pension and restructuring continuing to wind down, and lower cash tax payments. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility and the opportunity to further increase cash flow generation. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of doubling free cash flow from 2012 to more than $2.3 billion annually for the full-year 2017. From the graph on the presentation, based on current assumptions we expect annual free cash flow to increase by over $650 million based only on our reduction in cash used for pension restructuring and CapEx. Combined with operational improvement of the business, lower cash taxes, and working capital improvements, we are well on track to achieve our expectations for substantial cash flow generation. Regarding our pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed our plan to new entrants and frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly $96 million to $220 million in 2015 and continue to decline thereafter. Regarding our restructuring program, cash came in to $82 million in 2014. As all charges related to the restructuring program have now been incurred, we expect cash payments to decline by $51 million to approximately $31 million in 2015 and continue to decline significantly each year thereafter. In summary, we delivered a solid start to the year overcoming a significant headwind from foreign exchange translation. Results reflect strong earnings growth and substantial free cash flow generation driven by continued organic growth in both segments, underlying operational improvement and working capital improvements, placing us firmly on track towards our goal of generating more than $2.3 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017. With a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we've positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation in 2015 and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you, ma'am. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Mr. Adam Klauber. Sir, your line is open.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Adam.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: My first question is about the HR Cloud business. We understand you've had some good-size wins in that business. One, is that true without mentioning the names? And two, how does the pipeline look currently for more good-size clients?
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Adam, it actually looks exceptionally positive. We are very pleased with the investment in Europe, as I described, but that really is continuing to complement an already strong foundation we have in capability in workday implementation. And it's gone exceptionally well. And to describe sort of the opportunities here for clients, it's greater flexibility, great platform, modifications over time, evolution, innovation, brings a lot of things to the table on behalf of clients that are quite beneficial, and we're very excited about it. So very positive trajectory.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: And I think you mentioned that that did help organic this quarter. Is the nature of that business lumpier once you win these clients, should it be more of a continual ramp up?
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: It really is a more continual ramp up as you bring them online and service them over time. And it had an impact on the quarter as – and will have on the year as we continue to succeed in the business.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then on the retiree exchange business, I understand there is more activity in the public or municipal side of the market. One, is that true? And is that more off-season than the traditional exchange business?
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, the public side has evolved as you watched in the press over time. As we've focused on the private side of the business, it's gone exceptionally well. It really does complement a broad-based set of health solutions that we have and we've had some and continue to have significant wins, both on the active and the retiree side. And we saw a little bit of off cycle in the Q1, this report, but that's going to, as I said, going to even out and really show up in the fourth quarter over time and will really normalize at that point.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Mr. Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.
David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to follow up on that when you had just mentioned the significant wins, I want to be clear, is that something that you're talking about a rolling on to the 2015 plan year? Or you're in active negotiations and finalizing those deals such that it would impact 2016? And just broader, could you talk to sort of what – how 2016 is shaping up? Are you at this point starting to see an inflection or pick up in actual enrollment?
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Just to sort of parse the questions. The first question was around literally the workday implementation in Cloud and the implications and how it's going to evolve over time, as that was coming online. The second – which will show up in the year – and the second was, what showed up in the first quarter, which was on the retiree exchange, some really follow-on applications that happened in the first quarter from our fourth quarter work last year. And that's going to continue to ramp up over time. And what you've seen on the exchange business for us is as part of our overall health solutions capability, that's just continuing to build and will continue to do so. It still will continue to be fourth quarter dominated as it comes online, and we'll just continue to see very, very good progress in that.
David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And as far as the inflection for 2016, is that something you're starting to see at this point? Or how – obviously conversations continue to be active and robust, and that tone seems to be similar, but just curious of the enrollment outlook for 2016?
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. The pipeline continues to be very strong. A lot of great conversations across the board on both the active exchange and retiree exchange. And as I described in my comments, the impact here has been substantial. In particular, the impact on, for us, the employee satisfaction levels have been exceptionally high, the opportunity to actually bend the cost curve, very, very positive from that standpoint. And we just have been very, very fortunate in terms of sort of our client wins and how that's evolved over time, and we'll report out in the third quarter as we complete the season. But we continue to make progress.
David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then just flipping gears over to the international side of organic growth of 3%. That seemed to hold up better than I thought it would in this environment. Just want to ensure that there isn't any unusual benefits in the quarter from timing. And assuming not, can you just drill into and provide a little bit more color about what you're seeing in the market, what you're doing to help maintain that decent organic growth that's going on right now?
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we really saw across the board really, not just in Europe but also across the Americas if you think about sort of as I described before, retention levels in U.S. Retail were exceptionally high, 93% almost near record levels. And then Europe also reflects very, very high retention levels. And then efforts we've done around Client Promise, the implementation of how we actually support and serve clients, introduce new ideas to clients as their needs change over time. And this has all been against a backdrop of the challenging pricing environment and an overall economic environment that's challenged. But from our standpoint, we view the opportunities in Europe and in the Americas as quite strong, quite positive and our capability to serve them is quite high. And that's really what's driven new business growth, what's driven retention and what's driven the results. And our view is we're going to continue to grow and build the business as we have for the last decade every year, irrespective of the headwinds and that includes all the aforementioned, FX, our interest rates or economic conditions or pricing.
David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Super. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question is coming from Mr. Brian Meredith of UBS. Sir, your line is open.
Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Greg, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about, or update us on progress on improving yield in the Risk Solutions business, monetizing that GRIP asset, that kind of stuff?
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: So, Brian, we would say we continue to make very good progress and reflected in the performance as we grow and improve margin over time and what we've done on the data and analytics efforts here really is helping markets, really our market partners understand and improve their return on invested capital and that's really fundamentally what GRIP is able to help us do. And we've got 35 plus carriers who have actually signed on to this and fundamentally it helps them succeed in the business and we're essentially helping them match their capital with our demand in a more efficient and effective way and that's what the data and analytics has helped us do. So it's progress. We're strengthening the relationships as they evolve in that area and watch and see data and analytics will continue to be a stronger and stronger part of our value proposition. It's complemented by the Singapore Innovation Center and the Dublin Innovation Centers which we've brought online. And you see it show up in the marketplace in areas like the Risk Insight platform, like Review, which we've done on the reinsurance side very, very strong, very, very positive and this is an area of substantial investment for Aon. And in many respects we believe we've got an unprecedented level of data but we need to translate that into true insight and action for our clients, and if our clients can take that data and insight and improve operating performance, strengthen their balance sheet or reduce volatility, we provided something to the market no one else can do and we believe that's distinctive. That is sustainable and that's going to create value for them and for us.
Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Just on the yield also, I mean, given that we're in a competitive and softening market, have you been able to boost commission rates or do other things to perhaps offset some of the price declines?
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We've done a number of different things to again come back to add value for clients and help them understand it and get paid for that and do the same on the market side. So in the overall environment, this all translates and shows up in the Risk Solutions margin which we would say we're going to continue to improve in 2015 just as we did in 2014 and 2013 as we march toward our 26%. So you'll see us actually drive – taking – pulling a number of different levers to do that, this being one of them.
Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Got you. And then just quickly on HR Solutions, Christa, the margins actually ex FX actually improved on a year-over-year basis. I would have thought per your guidance they would have actually declined. Was there something unusual that happened in the quarter?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. You're right. It did improve 10 basis points on an underlying basis. We did see some timing between Q1 and Q2, Brian, and what we would say is that the first half is going to be down exactly in line with guidance and the second half up in operating income to grow overall operating income and margin for the full year.
Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Got you. So a little bit tougher in the second quarter? Great.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's right.
Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question is coming from Mr. Dan Farrell of Piper Jaffray. Sir, your line is open.
Daniel Farrell - Piper Jaffray: Thanks and good morning. Just back on the Risk Solutions margins, Greg, when you – in your prepared comments you talked about ongoing investment in that business to drive organic and then drive improved operating leverage. Do you think investments in that business right now are running higher than you ultimately think they will be? And then, is there anything else to be thinking about from a mix perspective in Risk Solutions that might be impacting margins say, whether it be Reinsurance, macro pressures there or something like that? Thank you.
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we would – look back, we are going to continue to make investments to sort of build and strengthen the business. As we said before, we want to do this while at the same time making meaningful progress and improving risk brokerage margin, marching toward the 26%. And so we're going just to keep doing that. And the investments actually happened across the business. They've happened on the Retail side of the business as we've invested in data and analytics as I described before, the Singapore Innovation Center, our Dublin Innovation Center, these are very, very substantial investments for us, which drive the Risk Insight Platform on the Retail side. We've invested in new product ideas in Structured Portfolio Solutions, a whole series of things we've done fundamentally to strengthen the value proposition that we provide to clients. If they understand it and it provides value in their business, we're going to – it's going to help improve Aon's performance. We've made equal and substantial investments across the Reinsurance side of the portfolio as well, and we continue to do that. And while certainly well publicized, Reinsurance is under some pressure given capital coming into the marketplace and pricing dynamics, particularly in the cat business, we love the business. We love what we're doing on the Reinsurance side. Our capability to help insurers improve their return on invested capital and their performance we believe is high and even unprecedented from an Aon Benfield standpoint. We're number one in treaty, we're number one in fac, we're number one in capital markets and the things we do around – with new capital coming in the industry. And so you're going to see us continue to invest. There is not a – it's not a high or a low, it's a steady set of investments we make over time that we believe will help us build the business, and we're going to continue to do that. While at the same time, we are very clear, we need to overcome headwinds that are out there, as we've done over time. This year, we're talking about FX. In previous years, it might have been interest rates or might have been the economy or it might have been pricing. We're going to overcome those, grow margin and invest in the business for the long term.
Daniel Farrell - Piper Jaffray: Got it. Thanks. That's very helpful. And just to follow up, some of your competitors have talked about needing to achieve a certain level of organic growth, say in the 2% to 3% range, before operating leverage can start to fully materialize. Is that something conceptually that you guys sort of agree with when you think about margin expansion?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I guess what we would say is, because of the investments we've made in data analytics, as Greg described, there's less of an organic revenue growth number we need to expand margins. I would note that in calendar year 2009, in the depth of the economic recession, organic revenue growth for us was minus 1% and we expanded margins. Having said that, if you look at our expense base, the primary expense we have in the business is people, and there is an inherent inflationary push, let's call it 2%, on that expense base, and so that is absolutely a challenge we acknowledge. But we also see that the return on the significant investments we've made in data and analytics, allows us to expand margin in lower-growth environments.
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: This fundamentally, Dan, comes back to Brian's question around margin and this idea of operational leverage. It's very important as you think about our performance versus the rest of the world right now. These investments we're making, fundamentally, give us the ability to both strengthen our franchise, which is really what we have to do, but also with the operating leverage accompanying the investments around data and analytics in particular, we can improve margin at lower levels of organic growth. By the way, it's not to mean we're focused on lower levels. We have high aspirations on growing the business. But the operational leverage in the business continues to grow.
Daniel Farrell - Piper Jaffray: Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question is coming from Miss Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Ma'am, your line is open.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. Just a few questions. The first, in terms of foreign exchange, I know the hit was obviously a bit larger than expected in the first quarter, and you guys had previously guided to about $0.11 for the full year. What do you think the full year level will come in at given how you set expectations for the balance of the year?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So FX is coming in a little bit higher in terms of the impact than we previously guided because since we guided last time, the euro, in particular, has declined versus the U.S. dollar. What we did say, Elyse, is that we'll have a modest unfavorable impact in each quarter in the balance of the year, most significantly in Q2 and Q3.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then in terms of looking at the share repurchase, I know Q1 is a high cash usage quarter. If we're thinking about how you might – the share repurchase level in the next few quarters, how do you kind of think about in terms of a go-forward level on your capital management outlook for the year?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So we're not giving specific guidance, Elyse, but what we would say is as you think about our free cash flow sort of growth, it's going to be substantial in the rest of the year. And obviously it's been significant in Q1 already and we expect to grow free cash flow for the year. And as EBITDA continues to grow we're very focused on our investment grade rating but we would continue to increase debt in line with EBITDA growth. And so if you think about sort of the overall cash we then have to deploy, we use a return on capital basis to deploy across all forms of capital usage and share repurchase is definitely the highest return on capital we observe at this time. And so we'll continue to deploy capital based on that.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: On the retiree exchange, the off-cycle enrollment, just so I understand correctly, was that included in the enrollment figures in terms of the number of companies and the number of lives you guys had provided in September of last year for the 2015 year?
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: It was. There's really, in many respects there's really no real new news here from the standpoint, this is just the current existing set of clients we brought online and we just had a few of the enrollments move over to the first quarter. It's going to – relatively small and this will balance itself out by Q4 and as we go forward. And it really is a little bit of off-cycle with that as well.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then one last question, you mention a decline in capital markets business within your Reinsurance segment in the quarter, just was the last Q1 a higher volume quarter so it was a tough comp? I'm just kind of curious especially we've heard a lot going on in the capital markets space why you might have seen a slowdown in the first quarter of this year, so any more information there would be helpful. Thank you.
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well top line it really was. We had a strong comparable quarter so that's a little bit of what was going on from that standpoint, a little bit of timing. But when you think about the capital coming in, we don't want to minimize that. There's still tremendous capital coming in, $60 billion plus sort of come into the market right now. We anticipate more over time. We, again, see lots of opportunity with that. I would just highlight in a little bit of the dynamics that as the treaty pricing comes down it looks more, it looks like more attractive relative to capital markets. So there's a little bit less of a – a little bit more of a balance than there was before. I wouldn't overplay it but we saw a little bit of that show up in the quarter.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, ma'am. Our next question is coming from Mr. Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Would it be possible to sort of quantify the aggregate FX impact for the rest of the year just so we can have an idea of what that might look like? I mean relative to the first quarter if we're saying it was $50 million or whatever it was in the first quarter, like how should we be thinking about that number, just the notional number for the rest of the year? Thanks.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Michael, what we can say is that the FX impact by quarter for the rest of the year will be substantially less than what we observed in Q1. It's going to be a modest unfavorable impact in Q2, Q3 and Q4, primarily in Q2 and Q3.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. But in the aggregate, just notionally, is it much smaller across the three quarters than the first quarter or...?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. And then one question on the tax rate, should we assume that the tax rate at the current level, is that something that you guys feel is sustainable longer term? That we should assume that, that is sort of the run rate? What are the factors that could impact that, either reverting or going lower?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Michael, as we've said previously, 19% is the right operational rate for the company going forward. We do believe it's sustainable, and that's the operational rate we're using for the company going forward. So we would expect that to be the best guide for you to use. Things that could impact it going forward are discrete tax adjustments, and they could be positive or negative in any one quarter. But we would expect that 19% is the underlying operational rate for the company.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, great. And then I've asked this question before, I wonder if it'd be possible, just sort of thinking about the HR segment, I mean obviously you're making a lot of investments and you're making them with an eye on operating leverage in the future. Is there a way to think about the difference between or can you give us some context on how we might be able to think about a contribution margin, if you will, relative to an operating margin in that segment? And maybe with regard to the private exchange element in particular, but just as we think about that segment, is there a way to sort of peel those two out separately just to get an idea of what they look like?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And Michael, I think what you're getting to is sort of the investments we're making around the healthcare exchange and how to think about the return on that versus everything else. Is that right?
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, that's fair.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. And so look, one way to think about it is if you've added up the numbers we've invested in healthcare exchanges, call it about $100 million. And so if you wanted to take that out of the current base it would improve operational margins by about 200 basis points is one way to think about it. But obviously the return on that investment is going to be significant over time. We obviously mentioned that we made a loss in that business in 2014 and that we would continue to improve returns on it each year going forward. If you think about the improvement in operating income we made in both calendar year 2013 and 2014 in the HR Solutions business, we're clearly overcoming a significant investment we're making in healthcare exchanges by the growth in our Consulting business, which is exceptionally strong, particularly around, as Greg described, pension de-risking and investment consulting as well as the improvement in the rest of our Outsourcing business. So those two things are improving whilst we're continuing to make investments in exchanges.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And so like this year if we think about this year investments should we be thinking about that relative to that sort of $100 million or is that – was that a bigger number and that number sort of scaling down as you start to scale up on exchanges for example?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Here's what I would say and I did say this last quarter. As we think about the investment we've made in exchanges, it's really an operating expense. It's not a capital expense that's one time. It's really people and technology. And so you should think about that $100 million level as the right ongoing level going forward. And then it's really about incremental revenue and to drive an improved return on that underlying operating expense because we would say that we've largely scaled the exchanges at the end of 2014. And from here we're now going to add incremental revenue and incremental cost as we bring new clients on but not those sort of significant investments we've made historically.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question is coming from Mr. Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. And the first question is just could you give a little bit color on the other income line? It looks like it's pretty lumpy from quarter to quarter. How should we think about that going forward?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So what we would say is it is obviously very lumpy and we in our sort of budgeting process model it at zero because we're essentially – it should be zero unless we monetize unproductive capital or sell a business which we deem as lower return or less of a strategic fit to Aon which is what you saw in the quarter. And so I would say the $19 million of gains I would say is lumpy and almost impossible to model so we do model that internally at zero. The $23 million of FX impact on our assets and liabilities and foreign currency and the hedging gain, I would say I net that myself against the $53 million of FX impact on operating income we had, say we had a net impact of minus $30 million on our business in terms of operating income from FX. So I guess I view it as two different ways if that makes sense to you.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's good. And then looking underlying, basically you're taking off $0.15 of foreign exchange impact and then probably the $0.12 gain on the other income line. So you look at underlying probably run at $1.40 EPS. That compares $1.28 last year. So year-over-year growth is about 9%. It sounds like a much lower than if you look back the historical last eight quarter average, about 16%. I just wonder is there any sort of seasonality in the first quarter or you think like we should still be able to sustain a double-digit EPS growth going forward?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Look, I wouldn't over-rotate (47:48) on one quarter. As you correctly observe, we had the most significant FX impact in Q1, and we're going to have a lot smaller FX impact through the balance of the year, so I'd focus much more on the full year. And we do expect significant EPS growth for the full year. As you've seen, we've done 16% EPS growth CAGR over the last 10 years and so we feel really good about the earnings growth of calendar year 2015 and beyond. And obviously and most importantly about how that translates through to free cash flow. We're going to see substantial free cash flow growth in 2015 on track to our $2.3 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2017.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Well, lastly just follow on the buyback question, like the first quarter seasonal weak but last year you did like $600 million as well, so just wonder, the pace of buyback would be sustainable at least at the level of last year given that your free cash flow is growing and also you can also elaborate a little bit more on the debt side?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. So again, I wouldn't sort of like over-project on one quarter. I would note that in Q1 2014 we did utilize cash on the balance sheet at year-end 2013 which was much higher than normal, and so we had about $300 million, almost $400 million of excess cash on the balance sheet at year-end 2013 which contributed to higher than normal share repurchase in Q1 2014.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Well, thanks so much for all the answers.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our last question is coming from Mr. Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, thank you for getting me on the phone. I appreciate it. I know that you're interested in growing free cash flow in addition to operating cash flow by lowering your working capital. I was wondering if you could put some numbers around the scale of what you can do? And also last year the spread between receivables and payables went unfavorable for you. I assume you were working on it. What are the pitfalls and obstacles to making that happen?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So as we think about free cash flow growth for calendar year 2015, we think there are four major contributors to it. The first is improvement in operating income and that's obviously driven by revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is decreased contributions to pension and restructuring. The third is improvements in working capital. And the fourth is declining taxes. And so as we think about those for the full year, Josh, we look then again to sort of the growth in free cash flow for the quarter of – free cash flow grew $140 million. And the two biggest contributors to that free cash flow growth for the quarter were pension and restructuring contributions declining by $89 million and working capital improvements of $63 million. And then to answer your specific question about working capital in 2014, I would note that we had substantial improvement in working capital in 2013 and that really created a headwind for 2014. And as you said it's a continued progress and we expect to have substantial cash flow growth from all four metrics as we drive towards the $2.3 billion in free cash flow for 2017.
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: But you really are highlighting an area that as you think about the new news over the last 12 months to 18 months it really is the projections and the perspectives around how we're going to be able to build free cash flow in addition to what we do from an operating standpoint. And the move to $2.3 billion by 2017, as Christa highlights, is a substantial, substantial improvement. Another doubling since 2012, which we believe really underscores the power of the franchise.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Certainly. Certainly. And just to understand, the $63 million of improvement, that's going to jump around quarter-to-quarter, it may be positive, it may be negative. But is the $63 million, is that a really good quarter for improvement to think about? Or is that what you think you can deliver for the foreseeable future all things being equal? How should we think about the scope?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, we obviously think it was a strong performance in terms of working capital. As we look at that $63 million we're looking at three lines on the balance sheet, our cash flow, receivables, payables, and other assets and liabilities. But we really think about cash flow growth for the full-year and so we're looking at substantial free cash flow growth for the full-year 2015.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. But there's no guidance though, around how we should think about just the payables, receivables part?
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Look, we will continue to expect that we will improve cash flow from receivables and payables. We haven't given specific guidance.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck.
Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks very much for joining us. We look forward to our next call. Thanks very much.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-02-06 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Greg Case - President and CEO Christa Davies - CFO
Analysts: Adam Klauber - William Blair Sarah DeWitt - JPMorgan Dave Styblo - Jefferies Brian Meredith - UBS Ryan Burns - Janney Capital Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets Arash Soleimani - KBW
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded, and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature and defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning any risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results as well as have been posted to our Web site. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc. You may begin, sir.
Greg Case: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2014 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our Web site for you to follow along with our commentary today. And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover three areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. Third, continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics; each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 3; in the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 6% overall; the strongest quarter of organic revenue growth in over a decade, highlighted by strong growth in our HR outsourcing and America's retail brokerage businesses. Operating margin increased to 180 basis points, reflecting strong operating margin improvement in both segments. EPS increased 23% to $1.89, reflecting strong operating margin improvement, a lower effective tax rate, and effective capital management. Now, if we turn to the full year; organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth in both segments, despite pricing pressure on our reinsurance business and overall economic uncertainty in Europe. Operating margin increased 50 basis points, reflecting margin improvement in both segments, inclusive of an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. EPS increased 17% to 5.71. And finally free cash flow was roughly flat at 1.4 billion, as record cash flow from operations of 1.6 billion was offset by a 27 million increase in CapEx. Overall, our results reflect a strong finish to the year, despite industry and foreign currency headwinds. We delivered continued growth in operational improvement. We are making significant investments in client serving capabilities across the firm, and returning a record 2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2014. Turning to Slide 4; on the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting strong growth in the Americas and improvement in reinsurance. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solution segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction in our retail business; new business generation of 36040 million across our retail business, highlighted by another record quarter of new business in U.S. retail, as well as double-digit new business growth in many countries across APAC and emerging markets. In our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have been positive for 15 consecutive quarters, an outstanding performance in today's changing marketplace. That reflects Aon Benfield's long-term value proposition for clients and the application of excess capital in the industry to previously uninsured risks, and increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology, and data and analytics with the growth of GRIP, ReView and Aon Broking. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions; in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 7% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was flat resulting in continued stable market impact. We saw solid growth across all regions; U.S, retail, Latin America, and Canada, and growth across all businesses; property casualty, health and benefits, and affinity. In U.S. retail and Latin America, we delivered a record level of new business generation. Results in the quarter also include 8 million of anticipated favorable timing that unfavorably impacted the third quarter. Excluding this timing benefit, underlying organic revenue growth was 6%. In International, organic revenue growth was flat. Similar to the previous quarter, exposures were stable, but the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many regions across Europe. We saw strong growth across Asia in both mature and emerging markets, and solid growth across the Pacific region, specifically New Zealand, driven by new business generation. Results in the quarter were offset by a modest decline in Continental Europe. For the full year, Continental Europe delivered modest growth driven by new business in many countries and the management of renewal book portfolio across the region; an excellent outcome against sustained market headwinds and economic uncertainty. In reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 3%, compared to flat in the prior year quarter. Excess capital in this space continues to pressure global treaty pricing, driving a significant unfavorable market impact to the quarter. Results reflect positive net new business in treaty placements, as well as growth in capital market transaction and advisory business and facultative placements. While record capital was placing pressure on traditional treaty, clients were taking advantage by purchasing more coverage. In addition, we're putting capital to work in new areas, such as the credit default market with Fannie and Freddie. And our industry market-leading data and analytics are bringing new solutions to the annuity market for life insurers. Aon Benfield's unmatched level of investment and exhaustive portfolio of support and services is creating real value for clients and new products that are helping to offset near-term industry headwinds. Overall, across Risk Solutions; we delivered improved growth in the fourth quarter as anticipated, resulting in 2% organic growth for the full year. As we continue to drive new business and to take a unified approach to serving clients across the portfolio, we expect lower to mid single-digit organic growth for total Risk Solutions in 2015. Turning to HR Solutions; organic revenue growth was 10% with growth across both major businesses, and in areas where we're making the investments in the business including healthcare exchanges, pension risks and delegated investment solutions. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding, and influence of market trends, and solutions that sustainably address the long-term issues that face our clients as healthcare reform, healthcare costs, and associated financial risks continue to rise at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions to support our global organizations delivered at a local level, managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes. Turning to the individual businesses within HR solutions; in consulting services, organic revenue growth was 4%, compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. We saw continued strong growth in U.S. retirement, primarily from demand for pension de-risking and lump-sum winter activity along with continued growth in delegated investment consulting and growth across businesses in Asia. Results were partially offset by a mass decline in Continental Europe as macro conditions placed pressure on discretionary spend. For the full year, we delivered 5% organic growth across consulting services, in line with our outlook for 2014, and we expect mid single-digit organic revenue growth to continue in 2015. In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 15% compared to 11% in the prior year quarter. Organic revenue reflects substantial growth in our healthcare exchange business as we recognize revenue related to the majority of enrollments that take place during the fourth quarter in our actives and retiree exchanges. Results also reflect new client wins in HR BPO as an increasing number of clients are adopting cloud based outsourcing solutions. Overall, for total HR solutions we delivered improved organic revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and full year as anticipated in our outlook for the segment and would expect this level of performance to continue into 2015. Slide 5 highlights the third topic; areas of investment. Aon has a unique and strong track record of developing innovative solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include: in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership with the firm-wide rollout of Aon Client Promise, a unified approach to client service across Aon to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We're investing in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, now capturing nearly 2.4 million trades and a $119 billion of bound premium. We continue to have a growing client list of more than 35 insurance carriers utilizing the platform, of which more than half have signed multi-year contracts. Existing client renewals have been very strong and an increasing number of clients are also adding strategic consulting services. In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions. We're also investing in the continued development of data and analytics capability at Aon Benfield to strengthen an already industry-leading value proposition and client-serving capability. A great example of this is Aon Benfield's review, a reinsurer dashboard and strategic consulting service to help reinsurers be more effective markets to seeding company clients. We continue to align our global health and benefits platform to capitalize on our global distribution channels and de-brokerage capabilities in an area that is high growth in nearly every region of the world. And finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increased scale at emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients. We completed 14 opportunistic acquisitions in 2014 for roughly 500 million, expanding multiple practice areas and geographies. In HR Solutions, we're investing in innovations to address high-growth areas. We're expanding solutions to de-risk pension plans that support increasing needs for delegated investment solutions, which fulfill our clients' needs for faster execution of their investment strategies. Aon Hewitt is able to offer a differentiated strategy based on our strong 3 pillars of actuarial expertise, investment solutions and pension administration. We're also providing a broader set of health, retirement, and talent advisory and advocacy solutions to our clients' employees and retirees to enable greater choice and improve decision-making. As part of our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions, covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies and funding choices, we continue to make investments to support future growth and strengthen our industry-leading position in health exchanges for active employees and retirees. During the quarter we delivered strong enrollment execution and excellent service experience for roughly 1.2 million employees and retirees, up 60% over the prior year, including the two largest employer transitions to the private exchange market in the industry. Our active exchange model is bending the cost of health care of the clients having placed over 4 billion in health insurance premiums across the growing list of more than 30 national and regional carriers. For clients returning to our active exchange the average cost increase was 2.6%, including administration fees and cost associated with the Affordable Care Act, which compares favorably to industry data, reflecting the average healthcare cost increase for self-insured large U.S. employers was approximately 5% to 8%. Overall, our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions continues to drive strong client interest and demand with both exchange and bundled solutions that cover all clients segments and needs, in an evolving healthcare landscape. We also continue to invest in our industry leading benefits administration solutions and consumer technology platforms, including extensive mobile solutions and cloud base outsourcing solutions for clients. And finally, we're expanding our international footprint to support a global work force with investments in key talent capabilities across emerging markets. In summary, we delivered 23% growth in the fourth quarter highlighted by significant operational improvement in both segments and effective capital management for a strong finish to 2014. Looking forward, we expect continued improvement as we've positioned the firm for sustainable long-term growth, increased operating leverage, and significant free cash flow generation in 2015. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our fourth quarter results reflected strong finish to the year with double-digit earnings growth highlighted by the strongest quarter of organic revenue growth in over a decade. We had strong operating margin expansion in both segments and the repurchase of 500 million of ordinary shares. Validity flexibility combined with significant free cash flow generation has enabled the deployment of roughly $3 billion of capital in 2014 with a record $2.5 billion returned to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. And roughly 500 million in acquisitions that are expected to drive future growth. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 23% to $1.89 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.54 in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter reflect strong operational improvement, a lower effective tax rate and affective capital management. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 13 in the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization, and certain expenses related to legacy liquidation assumed by us prior to 2005. In addition, changes in foreign currency rates had a $0.06 unfavorable impact on EPS in the quarter, due primarily to a stronger dollar versus most currencies particularly the Euro. For 2014, a stronger dollar drove an estimated $39 million or $0.11 unfavorable impact on EPS. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a similar impact in the full year 2015 as we saw in 2014, with the first quarter incurring the majority of the impact in retail brokerage due to a weaker Euro, while Q2 to Q4 should see no material impact year-over-year. We expect to drive further operational improvement and affectively allocate capital resulting in continued strong EPS growth in 2015. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segments, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 24.7%, and operating income increased 5% versus the prior year quarter. Results from the quarter reflect solid organic revenue growth and return on our investments in data and analytics such as GRIP and on broking. Let me spend a moment on the Aon Hewitt restructuring program. Savings in the fourth quarter estimated at $25 million compared to $21 million in the prior year quarter. The AON Hewitt program is now complete. The program delivered total cumulative expense savings of $402 million, of which $99 million were in Risk Solutions. In Q4 we delivered strong operating performance in Risk Solutions despite a significant unfavorable market impact in reinsurance and continued economic uncertainty in Europe. The 2014 Risk Solutions operating income grew 2% operating margins increased 40 basis points to 22.9% including a minus 30 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translations. Excluding the impact from foreign currency underlying operating margin increased 70 basis points. We are firmly on track for improved operating income performance in 2015 and further margin expansion towards our long term target of 26%. This is driven by the return on investments we have made giving us greater operating leverage in the business and expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate, global procurement and utilization of offshore capacity. Turning to the HR Solutions segment; organic revenue growth was 10%. Operating margin increased 210 basis points to 23.5%, and operating income increased 19% versus the prior year quarter. Strong organic revenue growth in the quarter was partially offset $9 million anticipated unfavorable impact from certain expenses that were pushed from the prior quarter. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, savings in the fourth quarter are estimated approximately t $76 million compared to $73 million in the prior year quarter. Approximately $304 million of the total cumulative savings were achieved in HR Solutions. As discussed previously, we provided guidance for Q4 to be up substantially in our seasonally strongest quarter driven by organic revenue growth in healthcare exchanges. We delivered a strong finish to the year as anticipated. Further, for the full year operating income increased 7% and operating margin increased 40 basis points. This level of performance is exactly in line with our full year outlook for HR solutions segment of greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth and margin expansion. As Greg noted, we made excellent progress in 2014 delivering on our financial goals that were laid out at the beginning of the year. Looking forward, we expect continued operational improvement in 2015 with quarterly [passing] or results similar to 2014, down in Q1, flat to modestly up in Q2 and Q3 and up substantially in Q4 in our seasonally strongest quarter. Overall, we are firmly on track for improved performance with our long term target of 22% as we generate greater scale and improve return from investments. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses decreased $10 million to $44 million, driven by expense discipline in the current quarter and higher than normal expenses in the prior year quarter. Interest income was similar at $3 million. Interest expense increased $10 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $10 million included a $7 million gain due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities and non-functional currencies and gains on certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $2 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $68 million of interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes; the effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 19.6% compared to 24.2% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by changes in the geographic distribution of income. The global effective tax rates for the full year were 18.9%. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 293.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to 311.4 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased 5.4 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 280 million, and there are approximately 9 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 2015 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 289 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. Further in the fourth quarter Aon plc's Board of Directors authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program in addition to the existing share repurchase program previously authorized in April of 2012. For the full year the Company repurchased 25.8 million Class A ordinary shares for a record total of $2.25 billion. The Company has approximately 5.6 billion of remaining shares repurchase authorization. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow on Page 10. At December 31, 2014, cash and short-term investments were $768 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.6 billion, and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.1 times compared to 2.3 times on September 30, 2014. Cash flow from operations increased 1% to a record $1.6 billion, driven primarily by growth in net income and a decline in pension contributions offset by an unfavorable impact from timing of significant receivable collections in the prior year period. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, was roughly flat at $1.4 billion, reflecting higher cash flow from operations offset by a $27 million increase in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect significant free cash flow growth in 2015 driven by operational and working capital improvements uses of cash for pension and restructuring continuing to wind down and lower cash tax payments. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility; we value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are three primary areas that will contribute to our goal of doubling free cash flow to more than $2.3 billion annually by the end of 2017. From the graph in the presentation, based on current assumptions, we expect annual free cash flow to increase by over $650 million, based only on a reduction in cash used for pensions, restructuring and CapEx. Combined with growth in our core business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate, we are well on track to achieve our expectations for substantial cash flow generation. Regarding our pension plans, reported liabilities on a GAAP basis increased to $2.1 billion at year-end 2014, reflecting a 90% funded status compared to a $1.6 billion at year end 2013 reflecting a 91% funded status driven primarily by a decline in discount rates. Not reflected in those amounts however are $933 million of overfunded pension plans that are included in non-current assets in the balance sheet. Considered together, our net unfunded obligations are approximately $1.2 billion. Despite significant pressure from historically low interest rates the Company has taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits, and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly $96 million to $220 million in 2015 and continue to decline thereafter. Additionally, non-cash pension expense with a modest benefit in 2014 and we expect pension expense to be a modest benefit in 2015. Regarding our restructuring program, cash payments were $82 million in 2014. As all charges related to the restructuring program have now been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $51 million to approximately $31 million in 2015, and continue to decline significantly each year thereafter. In summary, for both the fourth quarter and full year we drove operational improvement across both segments and delivered double-digit earnings growth. In addition, we returned a record $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2014 through 2.5 billion of share repurchase and dividends as well as the deployment of roughly $500 million of capital towards acquisitions that are expected to drive future growth. We expect strong earnings growth and significant free cash generation in 2015 as we've progressed towards our goal of generating more than $2.3 billion of free cash flow by the end of 2017. With a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility we have positioned the firm to significant shareholder value creation in 2015 and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair.
Q - Adam Klauber: Good morning, everyone. Couple of different questions; one, how should we think about the margin on the health exchange as we go into 2015? As you mentioned, I think you have 1.2 million people on the exchange today. I would assume for that 1.2 million people you have already done, implementation costs and the service costs are much higher first year, so do those -- from margin perspective, do those 1.2 million people become more margin accretive in '15 versus '14?
Christa Davies: So, Adam, I would say healthcare exchanges, we made a modest loss in 2014 as you know. We'll continue to make progress in 2015, and I would describe it as an immaterial impact. We're really focused on our HR Solutions business and growing overall revenue growth as Greg described as mid single-digit revenue growth and continuing to grow operating income, and that's really the overall focus. And you should see the margin expansion towards 22% [ph] over time.
Q - Adam Klauber: Okay. And then, can you talk about -- I noticed you did a -- I think not a big deal, but another workday integrator in Europe, I think you bought the largest in the U.S. last year, that workday business, that's growing very rapidly. Is that part of your success in the -- growing your BPO outsource business? Could you discuss that a bit?
Christa Davies: Absolutely, Adam. So we have invested significantly in workday capability in our BPO business and it is driving substantial growth as you described. We brought the largest implementation firm in the U.S., in 2012, OmniPoint. And we just closed the acquisition Cloud, which is the largest implementation firm across Europe. And we're very excited about the growth prospects of that business and how it enables us to deliver that capability plans.
Q - Adam Klauber: Sorry, could you just go on to a bit of detail on that, I don't think everyone is familiar what workday does and why is that driving growth, just more specifically?
Christa Davies: Yes. I think the way we will describe the capability for larger than more sophisticated clients is it's a Software as a Service application as opposed to an on-premises application, and really the Software as a Service application enables clients to have much greater functionality. It's much lower cost. It's much easier to scale globally. And so, clients wanted to be more efficient and provide much greater analytics around the HR function.
Q - Adam Klauber: Okay. And then finally, how is the pipeline for the pension transfer business?
Greg Case: Adam, it's actually been quite strong. If you think about what our clients are going through right now with the regulatory changes and challenges and general state of pensions on the world today, you can imagine it's a very substantial area of concern and interest for clients. And so as such we've been fortunate we've led a number of the situations that have actually been completely in the last 18 months, and we are continuing to do that. And really this is one of the contributor that drives overall consulting business that has actually progressed very, very well as you've seen in the results.
Q - Adam Klauber: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan.
Sarah DeWitt: Low to mid single-digit organic growth in 2015, but P&C prices fall and we don't get much of a pick up in the global economy, to what extend do you think you can still achieve that and grow margin?
Greg Case: So Sarah, you were cut off at the beginning, but I think you're asking the question, just correct me, we grew top line and we grew margin in '14, there is lot of pricing pressure, can we still do it in '15? Am I paraphrasing where you were?
Sarah DeWitt: Right, and what to extend is your low -- can you still achieve your low to mid single-digit organic growth target in '15?
Greg Case: Right. So top line, we're very comfortable and confident we're going to continue the low to mid single-digit growth in 2015. If you step back and think about it, with the insight platform, the global risk insight platform, we capture exactly what happens across our book. And what you've actually seen is a reduction in price as you described, offset by a modest improvement or increase in exposure, that's roughly flat overall. That's what we've seen. We think it will trend toward that. And with more pressure on the reinsurance side, that's offset quite substantially by efforts we've undertaken in the business to grow the business, both fundamentally with Aon Client Promise, but also with the investments we're making in data and analytics. And you are actually seeing that show through in almost every situation. Our new business is literally a record level of new business in the U.S. Never been achieved before and actually it patterns us very well for 2015, and really is a reflection of the underlying investments that the team has made over the last number of years in the business. So we're very, very comfortable. If you think about sort of progress over the last number of years, there's always been some version of a headwind out there and there will be in 2015, but we're quite confident we can move through that and grow the business and improve margin.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, thanks. And then on the pension, I heard your comments, but I still don't understand why are the future pension cash contributions decreasing when the liability on the balance sheet increased?
Christa Davies: Yes, really because of a lot of moves we've made, Sarah, over the last five to seven years; we have frozen the plans, we've closed them, we decreased the benefits, and we continue to de-risk certain plan assets. And so that means that the cash contributions are really much more stable and on a path of decline, then they would otherwise be if we hadn't taken those steps. The other thing I would say, which I mentioned earlier is there is an overfunded asset in other assets of approximately 900 million, and if you add that to the minus 2.1 unfunded liability, you get a net of 1.2 billion, which is fairly sort of similar to last year of about 1.05 billion.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is Dave Styblo of Jefferies.
Dave Styblo: Sure. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions; I just want to start out a little bit more on the FX headwinds and how you guys think about that for '15? I guess my understanding is that the stronger dollar against your British pound or Rupee are actually positive, and how much does that help mitigate currency pressure against the other currencies out there? And I guess the short one I'm trying to get to sense of how much of an EPS headwind are you expecting in '15 from the net…
Christa Davies: Yes. Dave, your question is absolutely right. We have a positive impact from the Rupee and Pounds and then a negative impact really from most other currencies. And really what I said earlier is the total impact of 2014 was $39 million negative or about a $0.11 unfavorable impact on EPS for the full year 2014. We would expect a very similar total impact for 2015 entirely in Q1, and the Q2 to Q4 impact is essentially zero. And that's really where that positive impact from the Rupee and Pound offsets negative impact from other currencies. Does that make sense?
Dave Styblo: Sure, that does. Thanks. Sorry, I missed that earlier; I was hoping across. Shifting gears over the reinsurance side here; I won't name names, but one of your competitors who are also having to report today also have strong organic growth of 3% to 4% in both retail and reinsurance brokerage businesses; I mean just wondering what do we need to take from that? Are you guys seeing something in a market broadly that's making it easier to sell into the market or some of the pressures abating, what are you broadly seeing, and are we just in a sweet spot at this point?
Greg Case: Well, David, if you step back and think about, first, fundamentally there continues to be exceptional demand out there to improve fundamental insurers' performance. That's what the reinsurance world is all about, perhaps to be a tremendous amount of capital chasing that. And that's what's been discussed and talked about with more capital of 575 billion underpinning the industry right now. That's the greatest level that it's ever been with more set up on the horizon. Having said that, when you think about the product; it's become less expensive, we are seeing actually insurers point different ways to buy increasing amounts; that's one piece. The second piece is if you think about Aon Benfield's level of investment and content capability over the last number of years, it's been expensive. And with that, we are actually bringing capital to different solutions. So what we did in the mortgage industry is an area of growth. What we've done in the life world is another area of growth, and essentially if you think about Aon Benfield, we believe it's the best in the world with matching capital with fundamental demand around risk in different categories around the world. And what you're seeing is a bit of reflection of that. I would say, again, back on the new business front, it's one of the strongest quarters in years we've had. It's been a long, long time, our new business generation. And we're just doing more to the existing clients we have as well. So from our standpoint, our capability and financial strength to invest behind this business and data and analytics fundamentally we believe will frankly separate us from what others can do in the space, and we think clients value that and are going to utilize and put their benefit and pay for.
Dave Styblo: Okay. And then last if I can sneak one in on the exchanges; you guys did mentioned your 2.6% increase for clients returning and other competitor is pretty low in that range, and these the impressive results and I'm just wondering how much of this is resonating with potential clients that you are talking to? Are you starting to see any sort of inflection point as we're going forward and selling for the 2016 sales cycle? What are the conversations looking like at this point?
Greg Case: Dave, it really reflects overall -- first of all, the team just did a phenomenal job in 2014. Again, we got 1.2 million enrolled. I want to emphasize enrolled lives on our exchanges versus eligible, as you think about it. When you consider, it's really -- for us as we've seen from a cost standpoint at 200 to 500 basis point change against a comparable plan design; that's our 2.6 versus the industry's 5.8. By the way, that's against a fully insured answer. That means volatility is next to zero versus a much more expensive and much more volatile answer. So you can imagine that's one of the reasons, that plus by the way, 87% individual employee satisfaction is one of the reasons why we've had a 100% retention on the exchange, and why as other companies look at it, they're seeing a highly viable option for them. So we've had very robust and active set of conversations with the pipeline. We're excited about the continued progress of this aspect of what we do in health, we do a lot of other things too with this aspect; and we are looking forward to 2015 and 2016 as we continue to expand exchanges.
Dave Styblo: Okay, thanks for the questions.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes. Good morning, everybody, a couple of questions here; first, Christa, I'm wondering if you could break out for us a little bit the growth that you saw in the outsourcing, I know part was BPO, part, obviously healthcare exchanges, anyway can you give us a sense of how much of that was related to the BPO, and is that BPO revenue kind of continuing? My thoughts are those are for the longer term contracts, right?
Christa Davies: Yes, I mean I would say we had growth across the outsourcing business brand. We had growth in BPO. We had growth in our traditional benefits administration business and we had growth in healthcare exchanges. And I don't want to over rotate on healthcare exchanges. I think while it's an incredible business for us and we're incredibly proud of the progress we made this year. We've also had great performance at our benefits administration and our BPO business. We don't actually break them out, Brian, but while the healthcare exchange growth year-over-year is also the highest it's the smallest of those three businesses too. So -- they're all growing to get to that total outsourcing growth number.
Brian Meredith: So is it fair to say the contribution for the BPO kind of the year-over-year growth of 13% -- actually 15% organic that was a big part of this, just a pick up there?
Christa Davies: I would actually say the BPO contribution to overall outsourcing growth for the year was modest. And I would say -- but it came from all over, Brian, it came from BPO, it came from Ben admin, and it came from healthcare centers.
Brian Meredith: Great, great thanks. And then on healthcare exchanges as well, can you give us a sense of what the pipeline looks like right now for potential new signees coming into the fourth quarter of 2015? Are we seeing a pickup in interest levels this year?
Greg Case: Brian, revenue -- I had said it in substantial number of conversations and dialogs, we feel very good about the pipeline and the progress we're making. As we've described, the outcome for the last few years where clients have been on -- it's just been exceptionally strong as I mentioned before to one of the other questions. Literally, we're seeing cost savings -- truly bending the curve the cost curve here. That's a level of 200 to 500 basis points which is exceptional and then when you combine that with the idea that this is not just reduction but it's also in price, but a reduction of volatility and so these are fully insured outcomes with clients set our individual employee sat at 87% plus that's been very, very strong. In assets we got three years with the data that we're looking to on behalf of clients and so you could imagine against that backdrop the interest is actually quite strong.
Brian Meredith: Right and then just lastly, on the reach the insurance growth in the quarter -- how much was period now they can be kind of lumpy?
Greg Case: You captured it very well. Obviously the capital markets transactions are achieved in both -- in capital markets also in fact another just had an exceptionally strong quarter that was a big piece of it. But I also want to emphasize the new business story here is exceptionally strong. It's one of the business strongest new business generation periods ramp until history of 5 consecutive quarters of new business generation. But we ended the year with a lot of momentum in that category. So it was really a combination but certainly reflects the lumpiness as you described on capital markets.
Brian Meredith: So would you say most of that was that?
Greg Case: No, I would say substantial now for Q4 result.
Brian Meredith: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is Ryan Burns with Janney Capital.
Ryan Burns: Great. Good morning, everybody. I'm not sure I may have missed it earlier, but did you guys give any sort of guidance for adjusted income in the HR Solutions segment. I know you gave kind of margin in quarterly basis. But just want to see if you had any guidance for the operating -- sorry adjusted income?
Christa Davies: What I did say Ryan was that we expect revenue growth of mid single-digits for the HR Solutions business in 2015. We expect operating income to continue to grow so we expect growth in operating income and growth in margins in 2015. And we expect to pattern very similar to 2014; with operating income down in Q1 flat to modestly up in Q2 and Q3 and substantially up in Q4 which is our seasonally strongest quarter.
Greg Case: 2014 was a level on year of progress we see 2015 exactly the same way.
Ryan Burns: Great. Thanks for that color. And then just my last one is -- obviously the payout ratio this year if I do dividends plus buybacks, it get around 150% of operating earnings; and I realize there's roughly $300 million of excess cash heading into the quarter or into the year. Just want to think about or just get your ideas as to how we should about that going forward?
Christa Davies: Yes, I mean the way we think about capital allocation Ryan is really around return on capital on a cash on cash basis. And we did deploy substantial amount $2.25 billion of into share repurchase because we believe was substantially undervalued today as we look at our own discounted cash flow view of the firm. And that's why are deploying much more capital on share purchase versus dividends. And so that's the way -- you should think about that forward. As we think at the total amount of capital we might -- deploy our return to shareholders in 2015 if we looked at the 2014 -- if you looked at free cash flow growth of -- 1.4 billion and in 2014 we'll continue to grow free cash flow in 2015. As free cash flow grows there is opportunity for incremental leverage. And maybe unproductive capital and then that results in the cash that we can return to shareholders and continue to look at that on a return on capital basis to the highest return n capital opportunities.
Ryan Burns: Great, thanks for answers, guys.
Operator: Thank you next question is Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Cohen: Yes, thank you. Looking forward, one of the sources of I guess additional cash that you say is a lower tax rate and I don't know if you were talking about 2012 forward or from today forward? Do you expect the tax rate to go down more from where it is now?
Christa Davies: Jay, we think the 18.9% tax rate for 2014 is the right operational rate going forward. What we would say is that as you think about the cash flow growth over time the cash tax is likely to be lower in 2015 because there are often timing differences between the effective tax rate saw in 2014 and cash taxes.
Jay Cohen: Okay. I think you can't really quantify that?
Christa Davies: No.
Jay Cohen: Okay, but the tax rate on a reported basis should be similar or relatively equal?
Christa Davies: Right. Yes.
Greg Case: Eventually -- it evens out. There are just say timing in such transitions…
Jay Cohen: Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Next question is Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi: Thank you, I guess one question that i had was on the pension expense and the impact of lower interest rate I saw in your presentation that you have the cash proceeds to pension declining, and so just trying to reconcile that I'm guessing there is some risking -- continuity risking activities that you undertook in the year to maybe offset some of the impacts of that but love to get more color. Thanks.
Christa Davies: Yes, and Mike we did say on pension expense. Pension expense was a modest benefit in 2014 and we expect it to be a modest benefit in 2015 again. And absolutely right market is due to the fact that we've taken substantial actions over multiple years. We froze the plans, we close them, we've de-risked the certain plan assets over time as you described, and all those things have led to lower cash contributions and sustained and pension expense being a modest benefit again in '15.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it. And then if I could just one on the exchanges is it possible now I mean we're couple of years in to the cycle and probably have better handle on -- the economics in the build out of the platform, is it possible to get an idea of how you think about the operating leverage that you get from 8customer being a traditional benefit customer versus on exchange -- how do you think about the return how do you think about the -- the drivers of whether its contribution margin or operating margin obviously there's a lot of expenses still so you've -- that net margin number probably still looks similar to the other business. But just trying to get an idea of underneath once you've factored out the platform investments how shall we think of how're they thinking about the one versus the other and the operating leverage of one versus the other? Thanks.
Christa Davies: Yes, and so, Mike, the way we think about it is return on capital unsurprisingly, and really when we made the initial investment in exchanges both in active in retiree we thought about our return on capital basis cash-on-cash. And you're absolutely right process; the investments are substantial in both operating expense people as well as the technology platform. And we are still investing as you know because we made a lot of an exchange in 2014. And what I would say is we do expect the return on capital of our investment to be substantially superior to the rest of our business which is why we invested so much in that area. And so we do expect it to have higher than average returns because -- the fixed cost are largely fixed and as we continue to get scale we'll get disproportionate returns on those incremental lives and clients.
Greg Case: Of course I do -- exactly the same way we looked at the other organic investment substantial across the firm, and what we've done in data and analytics across the insights platform is the exact same approach. Ultimately, we are making use of assets because they -- we believe we will serve clients fundamentally better. That absolutely has to be in place. And that certainly is in place for the exchanges but they also have to give us greater operating leverage. And so we're essentially investing cash flow back into the business to create greater operating leverage and that's in fact what the exchanges are doing -- that's what data analytics has done. That's the risk insight platform is doing. That's what U.S. is going to do, et cetera, et cetera. So that's the philosophy; everything you see us do sort of follows that same track.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it. When we think about timing, if we were to quarantine the revenues and expansions from exchanges and put those aside, because you're basically flat, it sound like. Then the margins on the rest of the business are expanding more than the segment, margins would indicate. And then at some point that investment that you are making is going to result in margins as well. So just trying to think about, like, what's the timing of that, and when -- because once we switch flips I mean that we should start to see that in margins…
Christa Davies: Yes, and Mike, you are absolutely right about that, because we also achieved margin expansion and operating income growth in '14, which we did in HR Solutions. We are continuing to invest and make lots in exchanges. Then you are absolutely right, the rest of the business is expanding margins and growing operating income growth substantially. So that is absolutely true. And then we would say as we look at exchanges, it is a long-term investment or a long-term return, and we would expect that to happen over a multi-year period of time.
Greg Case: And again, if I could I would broaden this is as a broader firm; if you think back philosophically to the question earlier on the call, which is, "Can we grow in 2015 and gets more headwinds?" Answer is we've grown every year and increased profitability and increased margin, and invested heavily in the business. And part of the reason we're confident in our continued progress against whatever headwinds are out there are these specific types of investments, because as they come online and create operating leverage for us, that's really what's going to fuel bottom line. By the way if the headwinds went away, that would be magnified, but irrespective of the headwinds, these investments, in exchanges, in risk insight platform, in ReView, in additional data and analytics, in the Singapore Innovation Center, in the Irish Innovation Center; these types of things give us operating leverage we believe is unique to the industry.
Michael Nannizzi: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is Charles Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets.
Charles Sebaski: Good morning. Thank you. I guess the first question I have, Greg, is on the healthcare exchange, and the cost save that you talked about -- the 2.6% rate increase. I guess, if I go back to a press release you guys put out in November talking about the healthcare exchanges and the increasing costs, that document said that the 18 returning customers to the healthcare exchange actually saw a 5.3% rate increase anticipated for 2015 versus the 2.6%. And I'm just wondering how you can help us rectify that?
Greg Case: Great. So, literally as were talking about, we were talking about the total set of companies online and what we see coming in, and in two-year average for the company, so I think we're little bit apples and oranges. What I was trying to do is give you the latest and greatest hot off the presses, what exactly is going on in the market and what we are seeing. I guess the overall market trend and what we are seeing; and so that's the 200 to 500 basis points. You still come back and essentially say, you're getting fundamental cost save in a substantial way; again, 200, 300, 400, 500 basis points cost save and no volatility, because it's fully insured versus self-insured, plus the client sat that I described before, that could be employee sat. So from our standpoint we feel very, very good about and we are trying to give the latest and greatest sort of what's going on in the market.
Charles Sebaski: All right. . Give a little update on M&A, both forward, but also what happened in 2014? You made $500 million of acquisitions in the year. But when I look at the revenue detail for the Company, it was kind of zero for the year on revenue impact. And so, I guess, in this $500 million you bought, what's the acquired revenue base? Where should we see that come up in dollars, or should it all be in 2015? And then, what's your expectation for the upcoming year?
Christa Davies: Yes. So you are absolutely are, Charles, we spent about 500 million on acquisitions in 2014. We invested in a number of geographies, the U.S., the U.K., the Pacific region and a number of specific capability areas, National Flood Services and LARK [ph] employee benefits being two great ones. The majority of these acquisitions were in our Risk Solution business. The thing I would say is as you look at the mix on M&A, it's mix of acquisitions and divestitures, because there were some divestitures during the year too as we continue to optimize our portfolio around return on capital. And what I would say is these are terrific capabilities. They are unbelievable teams. They really place the teams in the capability sub front and they will generate great returns in the long-term.
Charles Sebaski: Okay. But will they show up? Is it a capability that helps your current Business grow, as opposed to net new revenue where we would see in an acquisition line?
Greg Case: A lot of these are tuck-in acquisitions that are impacting the overall business. You're going to start to see them in top line. You will also see them with existing business we've got, magnifying and expand that business. So it will be a combination of both. The investments of 500 million or so investments in '14, you're going to certainly see in '15. A lot of it depends on timing when they come in. You are going to see us still continuing to make in the order of 200, 300, $400 million of acquisitions per year, where we can build content capability, and we've been doing that quite well.
Charles Sebaski: And then finally, one of your initiatives that you mentioned is the global consulting initiative that you mentioned, Greg; and I believe this is more of a management consulting initiative for insurance companies?
Greg Case: Yes, what I would, it wasn't really broad-based consulting. In essence, what the team is doing is really a step-forward is they brought very, very unique data and analytics capability to bear on behalf of our insurance clients, much likely we've done with insights platform. And they not only brought what's called ReView. They not only brought that to bear. They also offered around that some wide space services to actually not only help and provide new insights, because essentially we're matching capital with client need, and they are doing that for at the reinsurance level now. But in addition to this, the fundamental raw analytics, they're also bringing an element around advice. And a number of clients have really valued that. And so that's an added component. Our view is data is interesting; a lot of people have it, we happen to have a tremendous amount, but data is basically work loss and that's what actually changes client behavior. That client behavior has got to drive performance and things like operating performance, balance sheet strengthening and reduction of volatility, and the way to help clients do that is to add some components around advice to it. So that's really the nuance that we wanted to try to convey.
Charles Sebaski: So, that won't be a stand-alone product within risk that might -- it's part of the overall value proposition, as opposed to a new stand-alone group within the risk organization?
Greg Case: It is going to be -- its part of what we are doing in terms of something we bring to bear on behalf of our reinsurance clients. So in that regard, it is capability that we are continuing to develop. It's actually gone through a tremendous start with lots of interest in demand in the marketplace. And so you will see it's part of our overall Aon Benfield offering.
Charles Sebaski: What's the size of that? How many people are dedicated things providing the service today?
Greg Case: Well, we haven't disclosed that, but if you take a step back and think about the capability of Aon Benfield, we spent over a 100 million in year in content, data and analytics with literally -- it's better part of 400 to 500 colleagues involved and dedicated to that. Again, back to the idea of how we create operating leverage in the business. This is just one more important, albeit, one more important step as we continue to build up that capability.
Charles Sebaski: Could you explain the legal settlement in risk for $35 million in the quarter?
Christa Davies: So that what a legacy litigation of liability we incurred as part of 2005, and a decision was made in the court against the expense incurred.
Charles Sebaski: Thank you very much for all the answers.
Greg Case: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Arash Soleimani of KBW.
Arash Soleimani: Thanks. Good morning, I just have a couple of questions; I know you mentioned the impacts of organic growth -- reinsurance organic growth coming from capital market; is there anyway to quantify the margin impact in risk solutions from capital markets this quarter?
Greg Case: We don't really break that out as we said before; it's a tremendously positive business for our clients and for us. We lead the market in it. It is something that we've built over the last number of years, it's exceptional strong and particularly lumpy, sort of up and down across the quarters and it was quite strong in the quarter.
Arash Soleimani: And was any of the lumpiness attributable to just timing differences, working capital markets?
Christa Davies: No.
Arash Soleimani: Okay. And my other question was in terms of the FX impacts, I know you quantified it on the income statement in the press release; how does that flow-through on the cash flow statement?
Christa Davies: I mean it's really flowing through net income, but it's hitting operating income, as I've described. It's basically $31 million lower in operating income and Risk Solutions is the way you should think about it. But I would say that if you listened to what we said, we said it's going to be the same FX impact overall in operating income and EPS impact in full year '15 as we saw in full year '14. And against that headwind in 2014, we grew EPS 17%. And so we feel really good about our ability to grow earnings substantially in '15 and grow cash flow substantially in '15, despite the headwinds.
Greg Case: In many respects FX has come up quite naturally two times on the call, it is a headwind as Christa described we will work through it and have it very, very effectively just like pricing was the headwind just like in interest rates or headwind et cetera; all these things are out there. Our ability to grow top line and improve margin in the phase of that, we believe is pretty proven and with the organic investments we've made or increased operating leverage, we think bodes very well for 2015.
Arash Soleimani: Okay, thank you for the answers.
Operator: Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: I just want say thanks to everybody for joining the call, and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward looking in nature, as defined by the Private Securities Reforms Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter results as well as have been posted to our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc. Thank you. You may begin.
Gregory C. Case: Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today, and consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance, and third, continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 3. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, driven by strong growth in HR Solutions. Operating margin was flat. A strong margin improvement in HR Solutions was offset by unfavorable impact from both revenue timing and foreign currency translation in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 14% to $1.29, reflecting underlying operational improvement, a lower effective tax rate and strong share repurchase. Finally, free cash flow was $704 million on a year-to-date basis, as we head into our strongest cash flow quarter. Overall, in our seasonally weakest quarter, results reflect double-digit earnings growth, driven by underlying operational improvement and effective capital management. In addition, we've returned a record $2 billion of capital to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2014. Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth. I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 1%, reflecting growth across Retail Brokerage, partially offset by an anticipated decline in Reinsurance and a $15 million unfavorable impact from timing. As we discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of a renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction in our retail business; new business generation of $216 [ph] million across our retail business, highlighted by another quarter of strong new business in U.S. retail; and double-digit new business growth in many markets across Asia and the EMEA region; increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology and client service capabilities with the growth of GRIP and Aon Broking. And in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 14 consecutive quarters, an outstanding performance in today's changing marketplace that reflects Aon Benfield's long-term value proposition for clients, focusing on data, analytics and the application of excess capital in the industry to previously uninsured risks. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2% against the strong comparable of 5% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was flat, resulting in continued stable market impact. We saw strong growth across Latin America and in our U.S. Affinity business. New business continues to be strong across the region, specifically in U.S. retail. Results in the quarter were partially offset by an $8 million of unfavorable timing across U.S. retail and Canada that we expect to largely reverse itself as a benefit in Q4. In international, organic revenue growth was 2%, similar to the prior year quarter. Exposures were stable, and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile conditions in many regions across Europe. Results reflect strong growth across Asia, driven by double-digit new business generation in many countries with solid growth in a number of other markets, New Zealand, Italy and France, to name a few. In Continental Europe, we continue to deliver solid growth against sustained economic and market headwinds, driven by strong management of our renewal book portfolio. Results in the quarter were partially offset by $4 million of unfavorable timing. Macro conditions remain relatively fragile across many core markets in Europe. However, despite uncertainty around economic recovery, we continue to see signs of stabilization throughout this region in Q3. In reinsurance. As we noted on previous calls, we expect macro factors to be a headwind in 2014. Overall, organic revenue growth was minus 4% against a strong comparable of 5% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect a significant unfavorable market impact in treaty, a decline in capital markets transactions and advisory business closing in the quarter and $3 million of unfavorable impact from timing. We saw solid growth in facultative placements, and as I mentioned earlier, positive net new business for the 14th consecutive quarter in treaty placements. In Q4, we expect organic revenue to improve modestly from Q3, driven by growth in our capital markets transactions and advisory business and a modest benefit from timing, while treaty will continue to be pressured by negative market impact. Overall, across total Risk Solutions, we're generating new business across the portfolio, while absorbing market pressure in Reinsurance and unfavorable timing in Q3. We expect stronger organic growth in the fourth quarter, driven by new business growth in the Americas and a modest improvement in Reinsurance. Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 7%, with growth in both consulting and outsourcing. Included in third quarter results was an anticipated favorable impact from timing of revenue and compensation consulting. This timing unfavorably impacts results in the first half of 2014. Excluding this benefit, underlying organic revenue for HR Solutions was 4% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. Underlying performance in the third quarter reflects growth in areas where we're making investments in the business, including pension risk and delegated investment solutions. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding and influence of market trends, and solutions to sustainably address the long-term issues that face our clients, as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risks continue to rise at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations, delivered at the local level, managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In consulting, organic revenue growth was 14%. As previously noted, the quarter includes an anticipated favorable impact from timing of revenue in compensation consulting. Excluding this benefit, underlying organic revenue growth for consulting was 6% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. Underlying results reflect strong growth in U.S. retirement, primarily for investment consulting. We saw an increase in demand for project work to help clients address lump sum windows and for actuarial services on defined benefit plans to support clients facing regulatory changes, specifically the recently passed Highway Bill. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic growth across Consulting Services. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to minus 1% in the prior year quarter. Growth primarily reflects new client wins in benefits administration and project-related revenue, driven by demand for discretionary services. For the full year, we expect stronger organic growth in Outsourcing when taking into consideration the seasonality of revenue recognition and health care exchanges in Q4. Slide 5 highlights the third topic: areas of investment. Aon has a unique and strong track record of developing innovative solutions to help solve problems in response to specific client needs. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include: in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership with the international rollout of Client Promise to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We're investing in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, now capturing 2.2 million trades and $113 billion of bound premium. We continue to have a growing list of more than 35 insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and services capabilities. Nearly half of the clients have signed multi-year contracts, and an increasing number of clients are also adding strategic consulting services. In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions. We continue to align our global health and benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities. And further, we're developing analytics to create globally consistent actuarial valuation and benchmarking models for health and other employer-sponsored benefits. We're also investing in the continued development of data and analytics capability at Aon Benfield to strengthen an already industry-leading value proposition and client-serving capability. A great example of this is Aon Benfield's review [ph], a reinsurer dashboard, implementation support and strategic consulting to help insurers be more effective markets for seeding company clients. Finally, we're expanding our footprint through over $500 million of tuck-in acquisitions so far in 2014 at an [ph] increased scale in emerging markets or expanded capability to better serve clients such as the National Flood Services and Lorica. In HR Solutions, we're invested in innovative solutions to address high-growth areas. We're expanding solutions to derisk pension plans and are seeing tremendous growth in our delegated investment solutions, which fulfill our clients' needs for faster execution of their investment strategies. Aon Hewitt is able to offer differentiated strategy based on our strong 3 pillars of actuarial expertise, investment solutions and pension administration. We're also providing a broader set of advisory and advocacy solutions to our clients' employees to enable greater choice and improve decision making on the retirement options, especially important as recent regulatory changes require more involvement from individuals. Further, we continue to make investments to support future growth and strengthen our industry-leading position in health exchanges for active employees and retirees as part of our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions, covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies. Across Aon's suite of private health exchanges, covered lives will increase by 60% to more than 1.2 million employees, retirees and eligible dependents for more than 100 companies across 19 industries, an outstanding result, as we saw 100% renewal rates, as well as over half of the clients continuing to be new. We continue to expand the number of industries and increase the number of carriers participating. Our model is bending the cost of health care and eliminating volatility for clients, while delivering more choice and strong satisfaction to employees. We feel good about our progress to date, the sustainability of the value proposition and our ability as a market leader to offer the most robust set of exchange solutions to clients. We also continue to invest in our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology platforms, including extensive mobile solutions and cloud-based outsourcing solutions. And finally, we're strengthening our international footprint to support a global workforce, with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets. In summary, we delivered strong earnings growth of 14%, despite a number of headwinds impacting results. Looking forward, we expect to deliver strong operating performance across both Risk and HR Solutions in the fourth quarter, benefiting from our investments in client-serving capabilities and resulting in a solid year of operational improvement and record-free cash flow generation. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our third quarter results reflect strong earnings growth in our seasonally weakest quarter, driven by underlying operational improvement and effective allocation of capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $500 million of ordinary shares in Q3. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding noncash intangible asset amortization, increased 14% to $1.29 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.13 in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter reflect operational improvement, a lower effective tax rate and strong share repurchase. In addition, foreign currency translation had a $0.01 unfavorable impact on EPS in the quarter, due primarily to a weaker dollar versus the British pound and a stronger dollar versus the Argentine peso. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a modestly higher unfavorable impact in the fourth quarter than we experienced in the current quarter. Now let me turn to each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 1%. Operating margin decreased minus 80 basis points to 20.3%, and operating income decreased minus 3% versus the prior year quarter. As Greg previously noted, timing impacted revenue unfavorably by approximately $15 million, which we expect will largely reverse as a benefit in Q4. In addition to unfavorable revenue timing, operating results in the third quarter include an $8 million or minus 40 basis point unfavorable impact from FX and $4 million of onetime cost related to closing the NFS acquisition. Together, these headwinds, totaling minus 120 basis points, more than offset underlying operational improvement in the quarter. Let me spend a moment on the Aon Hewitt restructuring program. Approximately $99 million of estimated savings will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $94 million of accumulative savings have been achieved under the program to date, with the remaining $5 million to be achieved in the fourth quarter. We have incurred 100% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings and expect to complete the Aon Hewitt restructuring program by the end of 2014. Overall, results in the third quarter were challenged by unfavorable impact from revenue timing, foreign currency translation, reinsurance market impact and certain onetime transaction costs, which offset solid underlying operational progress as we generate return on our investments and manage expenses. Year-to-date, Risk Solutions margins are up 10 basis points, including a minus 40 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency. We expect to deliver strong operating margin performance in Q4, resulting in solid margin improvement for the full year, placing us firmly on track for continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%. Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 7%. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 16.5%, and operating income increased 15% versus the prior year quarter. Strong organic revenue growth and anticipated favorable impact from timing of revenue and a $9 million benefit from timing of certain expenses was partially offset by an anticipated increase in expenses related to future growth in health care exchanges. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, approximately $301 million of the $303 million in total cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, with the remaining $2 million to be achieved in the fourth quarter. As discussed previously, we provided guidance for Q3 to be relatively flat. This included favorable revenue timing in compensation consulting that negatively impacted the first half of 2012, and increased expense to support future growth in health care exchanges. Our third quarter results were modestly better than previous guidance, primarily reflecting some incremental demand for project work in retirement consulting, and a $9 million benefit from timing of certain expenses. We expect the $9 million to unfavorably impact Q4 compared to our original expectations but have no impact on our full year outlook. Throughout the year, we have provided commentary regarding the full year outlook for HR Solutions segment, and this remains unchanged. For HR Solutions in 2014, we expect to, number one, deliver organic growth; number two, generate greater scale and improved return from investments; number three, deliver remaining savings related to the restructuring program; number four, and lastly, deliver greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth and further margin expansion toward our long-term target of 22%. Overall, the outlook is unchanged, and we are firmly on track for greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth in 2014, with Q3 modestly better than anticipated and Q4 up substantially in our seasonally strongest quarter, including strong organic growth in our health care exchanges. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses decreased $4 million to $39 million, primarily driven by expense discipline in the quarter. Interest income was similar at $3 million. Interest expense increased $12 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding and costs associated with certain derivative hedging programs. Other income of $35 million primarily includes a gain on the sale of our eSolutions business and gains on certain long-term investments. These gains reflect our intent to optimize the portfolio around highest return capital as well as monetize unproductive capital. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $66 million of interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 19.1% compared to 25.1% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by changes in the geographic distribution of income, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from certain discrete tax items. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 296.1 million in the third quarter compared to 312.9 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased 5.8 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $500 million in the third quarter. The company has $1.1 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 285 million, and there are approximately 10 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2014 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 295 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow on Page 10. At September 30, 2014, cash and short-term investments were $599 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.5 billion, and overall debt to capital decreased modestly to 43.3% at September 30 compared to 43.6% at June 30, driven by a decrease in total debt outstanding. For the first 9 months of 2014, cash flow from operations decreased 10% to $883 million, driven primarily by significant receivable collections in the prior year period, and higher-than-normal tax payments, partially offset by a decline in pension contributions. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, was $704 million, reflecting lower cash flow from operations and a $5 million increase in CapEx. Looking forward, the fourth quarter is our seasonally strongest cash flow quarter, and we are on track to deliver cash flow growth for the full year. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are 3 primary areas that will contribute to our goal of doubling free cash flow to more than $2.3 billion annually by the end of 2017. From the graph in the presentation, based on current assumptions, we expect annual free cash flow to increase by over $600 million based only on a reduction in cash used for pensions and restructuring. Combined with growth in the core business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate, we are well on track to achieve our expectations for substantial cash flow generation. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits, and continue to derisk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly $138 million to $385 million in 2014 and continue to decline thereafter. Regarding our restructuring program, cash payments were $152 million in 2013. As all charges related to the restructuring program have now been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $65 million to approximately $87 million in 2014, and continue to decline significantly each year thereafter. In summary, we delivered double-digit earnings growth in the third quarter and have returned a record amount of capital to shareholders year-to-date. We expect strong performance in the fourth quarter, placing us firmly on track for growth, margin expansion in both segments and record-free cash flow generation for the full year. With a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we expect to generate more than $2.3 billion of annual free cash flow by the end of 2017. We have positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation in 2014 and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just 1 or 2 questions. In HR Solutions, could you talk about the pension transfer opportunity? You had one big win. How does the pipeline look? And also was this quarter helped by that one good-sized win?
Gregory C. Case: Adam, the pension opportunity, as the laws have sort of shifted and changed a bit, particularly, the Highway Bill, as I mentioned, created a number of different opportunities to support clients with demand. There was some influence on the quarter, but it will happen over time as we help clients sort of react to the situation. But overall, the business has just done very, very well. It's on a very, very good trajectory, but not an undue [ph] influence in the quarter but just will happen over time.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So do you think that will be a good driver of growth as we look in '15 and '16 for that segment?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, I think it really is an indication of just the change that happens in this segment and just continues to happen. As you think about sort of the whole world around pensions and sort of what's going on, sort of in that context, clients continuing to have to react to different regulatory changes. And whether it's the Highway Bill we described before, in Montreal, there was a change in regulation that also impacted overall, so this is basically U.S., Canada. The U.K. is also seeing regulatory change. These sorts of changes are exactly what our clients have to react to and what we're very well equipped to help them support, and that drives fundamental demand in the business, and that will actually influence and help us and help our clients, not only in '14, but in '15 and '16 and beyond.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then as far as health exchanges, you had a good selling season. You added a fair amount of clients. There -- from what we can see, there was not one large jumbo client. Could you talk about maybe the mindset of some of the large jumbo clients in the pipeline as you think about the larger clients for the next couple of years?
Gregory C. Case: Well, we would say, look, Adam, fundamentally, we are very pleased with the progress we made around -- what is our mission here is a health solutions. That's really what we're trying to bring into the table and an objective and a mission we have on behalf of our clients. Against that, when you think about it, we have a base that's 23 million strong in terms of who we serve sort of in the health category, with $9.5 million in health and benefits alone, and it was really against that backdrop we brought forward was the first of its kind, which is the fully insured multi-carrier exchange. And as we reported, the results have been very, very strong, 1.2 million lives, 100-plus companies, in that context, 60% growth. And the pipeline we've got is exceptionally strong, stronger this year than it was last year as clients have sort of seen this come online. It's resulted in a fundamental bending of the cost curve, which is what we had hoped and anticipated. That includes, by the way, everything thrown in there, taxes, fees everything else, and a real meaningful cost for employee savings around that. We've also seen carriers come on board. So on the active side, 30-plus national and regional carriers. We've expanded coverage, over 10 elected benefits. And on the retiree side, 90-plus health insurance carriers with over 3,700 plans. So the fundamental chassis, the basis, the foundation is exactly what we hoped it would be. Even the industry, frankly, 19 different industries represented, finance, manufacturing, retail, health care technology. And I would say fundamentally, the thing that's driven this more than anything else, from our standpoint, we're excited about, is the impact on the employee. In the end, that's really what the whole focus of the mission is about. I think the numbers, as we've seen them, to date, over 85% of employees, 87%, in fact, love the ability to have choice, transparency and to really have a greater accountability. And a large percentage, 3/4 of them really feel good about -- they're choosing the right health care plan for them, for their families, for their situation. So for us, we really have appreciated the trajectory that our colleagues have been able to build sort of in the category of exchanges. Remember, exchange is a part of our overall strategy, one piece of it, an important piece of it. Fully insured multi-carrier has just gone exceptionally well, and we anticipate that will happen over time. This was never about a quarter or a year for us. This is about, over a period of time, developing a meaningful business that will help serve our clients. And that's exactly where we think we are.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And just one follow-up on exchanges. I know you have a partnership with eHealth, and they actually talked about it that they have -- it sounds like a fair amount of companies are going to be looking at helping their part-time employees potentially find coverage on the federal exchange or for -- yes, on the federal exchange. If that takes off, will that actually help -- will that revenue hit more in the first quarter and second quarter versus all in the fourth quarter?
Gregory C. Case: It's going to really be over time, as you tend to sort of think about how this evolves. And sort of depending on how it plays out, it's going to have a modest impact. And I just want to emphasize, overall -- again, as we think about the conversation around exchanges, exchanges, overall, when you think about sort of the impact to 2014, have really been an investment for us and will continue to be, as we start to see benefit in '15 and '16. But the category you're describing is important, because it affects individuals, but from a financial standpoint, will have minimal overall impact on us.
Operator: Next question, Dan Farrell, Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: So tax rate again came in at a pretty low rate, and you've talked about some of the geographic things going on, but also some negative discrete items. I'm just wondering within the geographic items, is health exchange accounting leading to some seasonality there, where there's some losses booked early in the year, and, then obviously, a lot of gain in the back half?
Christa Davies: No. As we think about the effective tax rate, it's really a full year estimate. That's the way effective tax rates always work. And so as we think about our tax rate going forward, the year-to-date rate of 18.5% is really the best indicator of our underlying effective tax rate. And as we think about the tax rate, going forward, for full year '14 or '15, it's really looking at this underlying operating rate of 18.5%, and then that could change in any quarter or year based on discrete tax adjustments, which as we described, were -- negatively impacted it in Q3, positively impacted in Q2, and obviously, can be positive or negative going forward.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay, and then there's also just been a lot of talk around the double Irish, and I was wondering if you could just give any thoughts if there's any impact with regard to any businesses that you have there.
Christa Davies: There's no impact on us from that. We are a U.K. company with a global business, operating in 120 countries, and we don't comment on changes in local regulations or statutory changes.
Operator: Next question is Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I was hoping to spend a little bit more time on your private health care exchange. I know you provided your enrollment figures and did speak positively, I guess, going forward about the pipeline. Just in terms of looking at your active exchange, if we look at the incremental number of companies this year, it's about 15, which is the same did join your exchange last year. Have you seen maybe some companies taking longer to make their decision? And if so, why have some companies held off? Were you surprised, I guess, in terms of the 15 that joined this year versus last year? And then, also, if you can just tie in, in terms of your long-term view surrounding the financials of this business? I believe in the past, you've said modest positive earnings in '14. Is that still the same? And then should we think about this as kind of growing from there when we look to 2015?
Gregory C. Case: Let me take those in turn. First, in terms of the ramp-up, no, we weren't surprised. And in fact we're not -- as we said before, we -- the mission we have is truly a mission around health solutions, the best set of integrated health solutions on behalf of clients. The fully insured exchange on the active side was -- it's just been a great platform. The clients who've joined it, I want to remind you, is literally 100% renewal rates. It doesn't mean that a client might come -- might not come off at some point in time, but right now, 100% renewal rates. So everybody who's on it has repeated, has seen tremendous benefits. Employees have really appreciated sort of the overall impact. And when you think about sort of the growth, it's been substantial, 60% growth in participants, as we said before, substantial growth in clients. And our view has always been we want to build this at the right pace and the right time. So we may very likely say to a client, "Defer," if we think actually it will help from a communication or employee standpoint more than anything else. This is about building this in the right way and the right time, and that's exactly what our colleagues have done. So we feel very, very good about the platform, again, from a standing start to go where we are now. And remember, as we did this, we serve more employees than anyone sort of in this space. And we said for the fully insured multi-carrier, we were going to actually start this in the most sophisticated largest market in the world, and that's the large carrier. That's why our smallest is about the size of some of the others' largest sort of in this category. And so we've gone against sort of that backdrop to make sure we're bringing the best capability to bear on behalf of our clients, and that's what we've done. And we expect that's going to grow over time. As I said, the pipeline's exceptionally strong, and we'll see how things play out over the next 24 months, and we feel very good about that.
Christa Davies: And then in terms of the economics, Elyse, I think we did originally say that it'd be modestly profitable in 2014. As a result of the significant win we had this year and the scaling up to support that significant client, it is going to be modestly unprofitable this year, and we look -- we don't think it'll have any impact on our greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth, which is exactly where we said we would be for the full year.
Gregory C. Case: [indiscernible] Christa described. We've been able to actually bring this online to develop truly a world-class platform with great capability. We're in the middle of the work, as Christa just alluded to, to the largest active and the largest retiree opportunity in the world by a substantial margin and been able to fully do that in the context of delivering greater than mid-single-digit operating income, and that's exactly where we are for the year.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of just a little bit more time maybe on the Reinsurance side, you did highlight improving trends in terms of organic growth going into the fourth quarter. Just -- is that partially a function of you seeing a change in growth, but then also, where it's a little bit of an easier comp when we look to Q4 last year. How much does that come into play? And then can we talk about the reinsurance markets, I guess, heading towards the January renewals. And we're hearing still competition out there. What would be kind of your initial view when we're looking towards growth in 2015?
Gregory C. Case: Well, if you step back, first, think about sort of where we are in Reinsurance through the first 9 months, we're down 2% on what literally is the, by far, the largest book in the world in terms of what we do on behalf of clients, #1 in treaty, #1 in capital markets, #1 in fac. And our treaty book is the most exposed to the area that's sort of most under pressure from a market standpoint, and that's the property cat world, both in the U.S., substantially greater, Japan and other places around the world. Against that backdrop, through the first 9 months, we're minus 2%. We're not excited about that, but when you think about that, that's pretty -- that's a powerful -- that's a reasonable outcome given where we are. We continue to make substantial investments to build the business in data analytics as I said. We're going to see that benefit coming through. We've had record new business across risk overall, and we've been able to improve margins even in this environment, and we think we're going to be able to continue that trend. Q4, we see the capital markets pipeline and what's going to close. It's stronger in Q4, less closed in Q3, a matter of timing. We'll see that in Q4. So we'll see a marginally stronger benefit in Q4, which will help us deliver the year. But net-net, when you step back and think about Risk Solutions overall, which is how Christa teed this up, we have a 10 basis point improvement margin even against the headwinds with 40 basis points in FX, and we're going to continue to sort of see that improving in the fourth quarter, which is our overall strongest quarter.
Operator: Next question is Cliff Gallant of Nomura.
Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Holdings, Inc.: I'm sorry to look at this simplistically, and sort of just, I think, building off of Elyse's last question there. But when we look at Reinsurance from the outside, and Greg, I realize this is simplistic, but earlier this week, 2 of your competitors reported growth in Reinsurance, and we realize that, of course, it's a very difficult market, but it's hard not to think that there might be some share shift happening. Is that not happening or is it something else that's going on?
Gregory C. Case: We would say no. In fact, not at all, Cliff, from our standpoint. Again, net new business won, which is what we track, has been positive for 14 consecutive quarters. In fact, we are almost among our highest ever new business results for the quarter and year-to-date for the first 9 months. So the underlying piece of the business, our colleagues continue to do an exceptional job. Really, just step back. Again, we're the largest book. I mean, there's no excuse. We need to grow. We are -- we anticipate growing over time in this business, but we have the largest book in the world. It is most exposed around the property cat world, and that's in the U.S. and in Japan, and that actually creates pressure. That's what we have to deal with. On the other hand, our clients have tremendous opportunity right now, and we're bringing more and more of that opportunity on behalf of our clients. We're doing it through capital markets. We're doing it through classic treaty and from other avenues as well. And so from our standpoint, we're going to continue to work, build the franchise and feel good about capability in Q4 and what we're going to be able to do in '15 and '16, but we have not seen share shift in any way, shape or form.
Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Holdings, Inc.: If I could have a follow-up. On the -- if I think about buyback, your pace in buyback this year has been very strong, and it's exceeding both what you're making in terms of operating income or what you're reporting for cash flow. And when we think of it, going forward, as a general rule, how should we think about what pace you can sustain in terms of share repurchases?
Christa Davies: Yes, it's a great question. So as we think about buyback, we obviously allocate capital based on return on capital, and buyback is our highest return on capital activity. We have returned year-to-date $2 billion to shareholders, of which $1.75 billion was buyback. And included in this amount was $300 million of additional cash on the balance sheet at year end 2013, and $800 million of additional capital from debt that we raised during the year. And so as we think about the amount of buyback going forward, it's unlikely to be as high as it was in 2014 due to those 2 additional activities. We don't give specific guidance, but share repurchase continues to be the highest return on capital activity across the firm. And given the substantial cash flow growth we see over time, we do see opportunities to deploy cash based on the cash flow growth, and there's incremental leverage opportunities over time too.
Operator: Next question is Vinay Misquith of Evercore.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Just looking at the organic growth year-to-date in the Risk Solutions segment, perhaps, around the 2%, how would you say that compares to what you would think that the company should do, and where do you think it's going forward? And just also attached to that, do you think that Aon can generate margin expansion in a 2% organic growth environment?
Gregory C. Case: If you step back and think about where we are year-to-date, as you described, we're at 2% for Risk Solutions overall, going into the -- with the headwinds that have been described already on the call, going into our strongest quarter. Through the first 9 months, at 2%, we expanded margin 10 basis points, including 40 basis points of negative FX. So if you just sort of think about can we expand margin against that growth rate, yes, and we're -- we think the fourth quarter is going to be stronger that the sort of overall year-to-date. Remember, a lot of the investments we've made and continue to make are not just around revenue growth by itself. It really is revenue growth and associated operating leverage with that. And I think we've been able to actually demonstrate very clearly our ability to grow margin with low single-digit, and if you step back -- or low single-digit organic growth. And if you think about what we described for the overall year, we've said we'd be low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the year, and we delivered solid margin expansion, both on a reported and underlying basis. And what we're reporting through the first 9 months is that's exactly what we're going to do for the year. And we feel like through the first 9 months, we've got more confidence in that now, having put 9 months in the books than we had even at the beginning of the year, and it was strong then. So to answer your question, we do feel like we can. Obviously, we're always going to go for higher and higher levels of growth, but we want to make sure it sort of meets the criteria I just described.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Sure. Just as a follow-up to this, I mean, this year was helped by the restructuring savings, and next year, I don't think that's going to be there. So do you think you have anything else that can help your earnings next year?
Christa Davies: Yes, so as we think about our margin expansion in Risk Solutions, it's really driven by 3 things. The first and primary driver of our margin expansion across Risk Solutions is the investments we've made in data and analytics, both in our retail business in the GRIP platform, which has over $100 billion of premium, and that is driving improved yield on every dollar of premium placed à la incremental operating leverage, and equally the $120 million a year we are investing in Aon Benfield data and analytics. So those investments in GRIP and Aon Benfield data and analytics are really the primary driver of Risk Solutions margin expansion in calendar year 2013 and calendar year 2014. And we'll continue to drive expense discipline and expense opportunities as we look at outsourcing and off-shoring. We look at being more efficient around our IT investments and our real estate footprint. So we feel very good about the continued growth towards 26% Risk Solutions margin.
Gregory C. Case: In many respects, generally [ph] the investments we've made over the last 24 months, 36 months around this idea, as Christa described, of really data and analytics to help clients make better decisions to improve their performance and also to increase yield per dollar of premium placed are literally just coming online. You're starting to see the impact of those. The fullness of those come online in '15 '16 and '17, and that's why, as we said, and continue to say, we're on track to continue to march toward 26% from a margin standpoint in the Risk Solutions business.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Sure, okay, that's helpful. And just on tax rate, Christa, so should we look at it at a 19% tax rate for next year? I mean, is that reasonable, and that seems substantially lower than the 22% rate that you had in 2013, excluding the onetime adjustments.
Christa Davies: Yes, we're not -- we're no longer providing specific guidance. The year-to-date rate of 18.5% is the best indicator of our underlying effective tax rate. And as I said previously, as we think about the tax rate going forward, 18.5%, plus or minus discrete tax adjustments, which can be positive, as we saw in Q2 and negative as we saw in Q3, is really how you should think about it.
Operator: Next question is Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, 2 questions here for you. The first one, just going back to exchanges. Christa, when we think about -- you've signed up a large client this year. That's one of the reasons that, I guess, now you think that the exchanges are going to have a loss for the year. So is every time you sign up a large client, you're going to have this kind of issue of expense pressure? Or are some of the expenses you're putting on as a result of this large client leverage-able as we go into kind of the following years in exchanges?
Christa Davies: Yes, it's a great question, Brian, and it's really the second. As we think about the scale we're adding in calendar year 2014, we're really building the infrastructure to run the business going forward. It's a fixed cost base we're building, which will then be leverage-able across new clients going forward.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great, great. And then the second question, I know as far as the 26% margin target in Risk Solutions, improving yield specifically through GRIP is, I know, is a big part of getting there. I guess my question is when you look at GRIP, where do you expect kind of the revenues and the profits kind of to come from as you get that 26%? Is it signing up new insurance clients? Is it deals? Where is it going to come from?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, Brian, it really is across the board. And again, the goal here is what is the Risk Insight platform? It really is -- it is as sophisticated or not as sophisticated, if you will, of just really getting insight to match capital to client need more effectively. So it really provides insight into our distribution capability for our market partners so that they can apply their balance sheets in a more effective way. Against that goal, that means it actually helps them grow and more opportunity for them is more opportunity for our clients and more opportunity for us. It would give us the ability to bring on some additional insurers, as they see that opportunity, but it also dramatically expands the group we've got. We work with over 4,000 insurers overall, but really, it is -- we said, 30 to 35, we have sort of engaged in this. It really requires the insurers, they're our market partners, to invest time and energy too because we're changing the way we apply capital into our -- into the marketplace on behalf of our clients. So we see really the opportunity all of the above, more of them, more carriers involved, more opportunity with our existing carriers, we think, is quite, quite substantial, and ultimately, even with our clients in terms of sort of what we're doing at this point and helping them make better decisions. So this is really -- GRIP was really just the first step on a journey called using data and analytics to help clients make decisions to improve their operating performance, strengthen their financial position or reduce their volatility. And that's really what the data analytics is all about.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, so it's more getting more penetration within your insurance clients is kind of where the revenue growth comes from [ph]?
Gregory C. Case: But even more than that, more coverage with the existing clients we have. There's so much opportunity that we have, as they think about what they're doing. And we think about our overall portfolio of 60 billion or 70 billion, being able to actually package those risks and deliver them to these carriers in a way they can provide better value propositions for our clients, really, really powerful too. So this is the structured portfolio of solutions, tremendous set of opportunities there. It really benefits everyone, benefits clients tremendously, benefits markets. We benefit in the process too. So it's greater penetration with our existing group and also other opportunities outside that. So that's the second, and the third is opportunities with clients.
Operator: The next question, Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: On the tax rate, one question, I thought the tax rate, the corporate tax rate in the U.K. was 21%. One, is that right? And then secondly, why is your rate below the corporate tax rate in the U.K.?
Christa Davies: Jay, we operate in 120 countries, and so our global effects of tax rate is really a result of profits that we generate in each of the 120 countries as opposed to the U.K. itself.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, so there's obviously other tax jurisdictions that are lower, and that's when you make some money, obviously, brings it overall down, okay. Fourth quarter buybacks tend to be smaller seasonally. Should we expect that again this fourth quarter?
Christa Davies: Jay, we don't give specific guidance on share repurchase. I have described why our year-to-date number that we've returned to shareholders of $2 billion is higher than it will be, going forward, because it included additional cash off the balance sheet of $300 million at year-end 2013, and the $800 million of additional capital we raised from debt during the year. And so as we think about our share repurchase going forward, obviously, it's based on our free cash flow growth, which is going to be strong, and it's allocated to the highest use of capital, and that's really our philosophy going forward.
Operator: Our next question is Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: First, just a little bit on the Reinsurance side. I just want to -- your opinion on -- more on the expense side. If you think about pricing pressure as well as some secular change in the Reinsurance marketplace, how much, like do you think -- what property level of expense, as well as where do you invest your money in that? And basically, we're trying to get is that we see in the near term some margin pressure in the business as you continue to invest. Why the top line probably is lower [ph] in the past?
Gregory C. Case: Well, let's step back. Think about what we're trying to do in the space, again, we're the largest platform in the world, #1 in treaty, #1 in facultative, #1 in capital markets. And what we're trying to do is we're actually helping our clients actually improve their return on invested capital, reduce their volatility, strengthen their balance sheet. And when you think about that opportunity, it is tremendous, and we see that actually increasing over time. The 4,000 issuers out there, many of them, if not, all of them would love to actually have improved operating performance, stronger financial positions, less volatility, et cetera, and that's fundamentally exactly what we do at Aon Benfield. So we see that opportunity is substantial. And by the way, we continue to invest very, very strongly behind that opportunity. Christa highlighted we have -- we're investing over $120 million a year in data and analytics in Aon Benfield alone, which we believe is substantially greater than anyone else in the overall industry, and we're making substantial investments across the overall risk business, not just in the Reinsurance business, and it really is that -- that's really, as we think about the business overall, how we see tremendous opportunity. It is absolutely clear that, currently, there's tremendous price reduction that has happened, and it disproportionately affects books that have property cat, à la ours. But having said that, we think about this across overall Risk Solutions, is it -- Risk Solutions, and as we said before, we improved margins in Risk Solutions in the first 9 months, and we did it against FX headwinds in addition to the market headwinds. So from our standpoint, we like our position a great deal on the Reinsurance side. We're going to continue to invest behind it, and it really is about how we grow that business through helping clients, and that's really what our focus is.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's great. And then second question on the acquisition front. You have been relatively quiet in the last few years, but now you just acquired the National Flood Services. I just wonder, do you see additional like acquisition opportunities that could augment your organic growth?
Gregory C. Case: We said -- we've done 12 acquisitions plus year-to-date. We've described NFS, and we described Lorica and a number of others as well. We've done in excess of $500 million for the first 9 months, and we see tremendous opportunities around the world and continue to invest in content, capability, geographic expansion, particularly, in the emerging markets. So we see tremendous opportunity on the acquisition front to continue to strengthen global Aon, and as we said, we're going to continue to invest behind that thesis.
Operator: Next question, Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.
Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions here. One is you called out the favorable competition consulting impact on revenues. Did that have an impact on HR margins as well?
Christa Davies: No, it didn't because when we gave original guidance at the beginning of the year in terms of greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth, and essentially flat in Q3, we were giving it in the context of knowing about this compensation, consulting revenue timing change, and of course, knowing about the investments we're making in health care exchanges.
Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then just on the exchanges a bit, I mean, obviously, last year, large case employers saw a lot of movement; this year, maybe a little bit more in the middle market. I was just wondering like, do you think in the near term there are trends out there that may support more adoption in the middle market at a pace that's elevated relative to large -- the larger case employers? And if so, would you consider expanding your offering to kind of reach down to that segment of the market?
Gregory C. Case: Again, come back -- remember our mission and objective. Our mission is to bring the best health solutions to the marketplace, and we serve large market, middle market, small across the board. So and again, if you'd go back to sort of the base line, 23 million strong, 9.5 million in health and benefits alone, that includes a huge amount of the middle market. So we already have a disproportionate amount of business in the middle market and a number of folks are sort of describing pieces of that in different ways as kind of self-insured exchanges. We don't do that. We're trying to bring a range of solutions, including a range of exchange solutions to wherever they have impact. We happen to have tested our first set in the large market arena, and it's done exceptionally well. We think there's great applicability across large and across middle, and for the clients that would benefit from exchanges, we want to bring those solutions to them. And if there are other ways we can serve them and help support their mission, we'll do that too. So we see substantial growth across the board -- substantial potential in the large market and in the middle market.
Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then, I guess, we've talked a lot about you've got growth, and talked -- focused a lot about -- on enrollment and the fact that we expect in the near term that you'll be reinvesting dollars back into the exchanges. You continue to grow in anticipation of more scale down the road. But can you talk about how you think about this business from, like from an operating leverage perspective? I mean, do you expect that at scale, should this business be able to deliver higher margins than your sort of traditional health and benefit business just because there's more technology and there's more -- should be more scalability?
Christa Davies: Yes. So what we would say is, obviously, we're investing on behalf of our clients. We've been doing that for several years now,, and we're doing that again in 2014. Long term, we absolutely expect this business to be higher than our target margins of 22%, and therefore, generate a terrific return on capital for shareholders.
Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it, okay. And then just last question, I guess, on this topic is, has the -- how has the relationship with clients changed to the extent that you were a consultant, the largest on the benefit side? Now you are sort of straddling that line between consultant and vendor because you now have your solution that you're bringing to the table? Does that change the relationship at all? And if it does, how, and if not, why not?
Gregory C. Case: It really doesn't. In fact, when we -- when this works well, we were able to provide a platform, which creates transparency, choice, even greater accountability for individual employees. We've actually enabled companies sort of at the center of this to actually create better alignment, more -- better choices for their employees. They then also take risk off their balance sheet. They control volatility and we've created alignment very much with the actual carriers out there. So that's the platform. And again, against that backdrop, 100% renewal, and most important than anything else, 87% employee satisfaction. But if you said yourself, is everything done then? Is all the health issues -- are all they -- are they gone? And the answer is no. This is an ongoing set of challenges for companies. It's an ongoing set of challenges for individual families, and so bringing advice and content and insight around that platform, when it goes well, that's really -- that's the most powerful outcome we can bring to the table, a very clear platform that clients can utilize, as well as advice and perspective that actually helps them take full advantage of it for their company and for the employees. So we think when it works well, there's -- it's highly complementary.
Operator: Next question, Joshua Shanker of Deutsche Bank.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I'm not going to be the last person to ask a question about taxes, unfortunately. When I've asked in the past, I've gotten an answer like, well, the data analytics for our health care exchanges are located in Singapore, or the data and analytics for our reinsurance business is located in Singapore. When the client is buying a health care exchange, how much are they paying for the access to the health care, and how much are they paying for your data and analytics services? Or similarly, in reinsurance, how much are they paying for you to buying the business for them, and how are they paying for your data and analytics? It seems like the data analytics is a small part and the access is the big part. And so I'm wondering, how much revenue is really being generated in Singapore that can effectively bring your tax rate significantly down below your domicile where you're located?
Christa Davies: Yes, I guess, what I would say, Joshua, is really, as we think about delivering value to clients, we're trying to ensure that we're delivering the best value service to clients, wherever they may be in the world, and a core part of the value we're providing for clients is helping them make better decisions, and the data analytics are a key part of making more informed and better choices in our Reinsurance business, in our retail business, and obviously, in our health care exchange business, as employees make the right health care choice for them, which is why we've got 87% employee satisfaction. As we think about our business around the world, we're absolutely investing in data analytics, because it's a huge part of helping us provide differentiated solutions for clients. I would separate that out from the tax rate. We are a U.K. company. We operate in 120 countries. As we think about our tax rate and our effective tax rate, going forward, the 18.5% is our underlying operating rate, and it's a mix of 120 countries in which we operate.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: But the health care exchange, for example, is a U.S. business that happens to record revenues in Singapore because that's where the data analytics is located, yes?
Christa Davies: That's not true.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So it doesn't record revenue in Singapore?
Christa Davies: No.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, then I'm mistaken in terms of how -- the information I've gotten in the past. And then -- so there are not countries where you're booking revenue in one country, but recognizing the revenue in a tax-free domicile in order to get a better tax rate?
Christa Davies: Joshua, what I would say is we have product development and innovation in analytics centers because -- to hub them in analytics centers is the best way to build deep analytic skill sets. So GRIP, GRIP is based in Ireland. We have 110 people based in Ireland. They're PhDs. They're statisticians. They're building that GRIP database. Of course we want them all in one location. That's absolutely right, and so -- but we really think about delivering the value to clients using that data in the best way for the clients.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: But if a U.S. client buys GRIP in the United States, is the revenue for the purchase of GRIP recorded as a U.S. revenue or is it reported -- recorded as an Irish revenue?
Christa Davies: Yes, look, we have global carriers, and therefore, the revenue is recognized wherever the service is delivered.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. I think that's the same answer, but I'm not sure, but it's a complicated issue. There's a lot of stuff going on in global tax. Obviously, I'm just concerned that you're actually doing a great job with tax, and I want to know if I can forecast that in perpetuity.
Christa Davies: And what I said on that is the 18.5% operating rate is our underlying effective tax rate. And as you think about the tax rate going forward, it's 18.5%, plus or minus discrete tax adjustments, which could be positive or negative in future years.
Operator: Next question, Meyer Shields of KBW.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Greg, one question, just to clarify, when you talk about Reinsurance organically being better in fourth quarter, are you expecting it to be positive or just less bad than it's been for the past couple?
Gregory C. Case: Again, we don't give specific guidance. We said it would be an improvement in the Q4, and it reflect kind of a negative 2% year-to-date. We think Q4 will be a bit better.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that helps. Broadly speaking, when you look at the demand for cyber risk, I guess, I'm wondering, one, is there -- is that something that's going to present a measurable opportunity for Aon? And second, is there any risk that clients that have gotten hacked look to the broker as maybe not pushing as hard on these coverages as they should have?
Gregory C. Case: Well, if you step back and think about it, you're really hitting on -- cyber, you can talk about pandemic. You can talk about sustainability, a whole series of things. Our view always has been, it's one of the reasons why we love this business so much on behalf of our clients, is our clients face a range of traditional risks. And globally, it's true. It's true in every country of the world. As populations urbanize, it becomes even more true around property, casualty, D&O, et cetera, and then you bring in all the nontraditional risk, as you're starting to highlight, cyber being one. But again, you could add pandemic, Ebola, whatever you want to add to that mix. There's just a whole range of those sorts of opportunities and challenges for our clients. We see that as a tremendous obligation to support them in that and opportunity for us to support them in that. And so we've invested and continue to invest very, very heavily. This is back to Christa's point around data and analytics, getting the insight and understanding so that you can just begin to quantify that risk. Therefore, you can then understand -- you can mitigate that risk and then price for it, and where there's opportunities, bring balance sheets into play, à la place insurance. But oftentimes, it doesn't even involve insurance placement. It involves operations, and we're helping clients across the board on all those pieces, and our clients are really looking for us to try to do that.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then one last question if I can. I think it's for Christa. The various revenue timing issues that you've talked about today, do those reverse in 2015?
Christa Davies: In 2015, no. The revenue timing issue, the $15 million, will reverse itself in Q4 2014. So really, in terms of Risk Solutions, what you should really think about is putting $15 million of revenue in Q4 because we've absorbed the expense for it in Q3.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Right. No, I understand that. I'm just wondering when we look forward a year, is the seasonal adjustment that we're seeing this year, does that go back to the way it was in 2013 or is this sort of the mentality?
Christa Davies: No, this is the new patterning, going forward.
Operator: Next question is Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: I was hoping we could talk about, just more broadly, the organic growth year-to-date in the U.S. in international. I think Reinsurance has been beaten dead. So we've seen a modest deceleration, and in hindsight, can you talk about any reflections on whether or not you think that's more economic growth changes or rate changes?
Gregory C. Case: Well, a little bit as we said before. Think about year-to-date in the Americas, the 2%; year-to-date in international, 3%. Basically, as we said, we're about to go into our fourth quarter, which is the strongest quarter we have across the firm. We see exceptionally strong new business trends, particularly in the U.S., have been exceptionally strong. So underlying, again, tremendous opportunity as we continue to build the business. We would say from a pricing standpoint, really, think about it as market impact pricing on one side, and then insured values on the other. Pricing is largely around the retail side, hovering around 0, plus or minus, very slightly, and insured values are holding up, I would say, not decreasing. So we're kind of marginal from that standpoint, which, by the way, might be a bit of an improvement, but marginal overall, and that's really the context.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Terrific. My second question, I was hoping you'd talk a little bit more about the other income line. I recognize that there's more than one thing in there, but it seems like we've had a couple of years where, on average, and I'm not asking here for a discussion really on the quarter, but more the year in total, on average, that line has become a positive number. Is that something that we should think about as possible in the future? Or I think, historically, we thought it as being something that in the end ended up being kind of a 0 typically over time?
Christa Davies: Yes. So Paul, I think it's obviously a lumpy line. And it, theoretically, should be 0 over time. What you see reflected in there is our continued efforts in managing the portfolio to maximize ROIC for shareholders, and therefore, it includes the gains on the sale of a business, and it also includes gains in certain long-term investments, as we continue to optimize the portfolio around highest return capital. So it is lumpy, and therefore, almost impossible to predict.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Well, I'm comfortable with lumpy, but I guess, it actually sounds like if you are -- continue to optimize the portfolio and sell things off and do those like -- and have these investments, that, generally speaking, although, obviously, with a lot of volatility, it should be a positive number. Or am I just completely off-base?
Christa Davies: Well, I guess what I would say, Paul, is as we actually model our own business internally, we model it at 0, if that's helpful for you.
Operator: Our last question is Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: The first question I have is regarding GRIP, and wondering, I think, Greg, you said that some of the 30 or 35 clients currently participating in GRIP are on multi-year contracts. I wonder if we could get some more color on how many of the accounts and how long those multi-year agreements might be lasting?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, we really don't disclose that. What we said before is, again, nearly half or so have signed multi-year contracts, but really, it was more an indication of the value they're seeing and the impact it has. That really is what we're trying to highlight, but we're not going to go into detail in terms of the specific mechanics around it.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. I guess what I'm trying to understand is I believe that the number's been around 30 for a couple of years now. And given, as you said, you work with 4,000 insurers globally, I would have thought that the value proposition you're talking about, we would've seen more expansion in that product line.
Gregory C. Case: No. Actually, we're not going for volume here. We're going for -- by the way, very good question, but this isn't about volume, it's about quality, content. With that balance sheet, our carriers deliver on behalf of our clients. So it's been a reasonable progression, 20, 25, 30, 35, give or take. We don't -- this doesn't need to be thousands or even hundreds, nor do we want it to be, because in the end, we're really talking about using data and analytics to change the way that an underwriter thinks about applying capital to our clients. Fundamentally, that means it's better for our clients, and it means it's better for the underwriters, better for Aon too in that process, but really, it's a function of our clients. That process takes real content, data and analytics. It also takes real leadership from an Aon standpoint and from a carrier standpoint, and this is really what we've been doing. And as those relationships connect in different ways, that's really what's drawn and built the overall GRIP platform effectively, and that's why we see it will expand over time. This goes back to Brian's earlier question. With the 30, 35, we think we see substantial opportunity to expand dramatically, and that's a huge benefit for our clients and for them. And then we'll add a few from time to time if insurers really want to invest their time and energy to make this work, because there's nothing instant about this. This is real hard work with new insights and new data to apply their capital in a different way.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Is that -- is there any sharing between that data analytics platform and what you're doing in Re? So I guess what I'm wondering, as you talk about the $120 million spend in data and analytics for Re, and I guess I'm trying to get an understanding better on what your total investment is across all platforms, be it health care exchange, be it GRIP, be it Re, on where you guys are on that relative to the $120 million you provide.
Gregory C. Case: Yes. Again, we'll be very clear. What we talk about with the $120 million is Aon Benfield only. So the investment on the Risk Insight Platform is not included in that at all. That really is done in the ARS book -- ARS business overall, so it's completely separate. We haven't disclosed what the number is, but if you think about it, $120 million in the Reinsurance business is a tremendous investment, annual investment. We invested substantially more than that on the retail side of the business. So now we haven't even got to Aon Hewitt yet. We're really just talking about on the risk side of the business. So back to what we're doing to sort of build our content and capability, again, we haven't disclosed it, but it's substantially, a multiple greater than $120 million a year when you think about what we do in Risk Solutions overall, and GRIP, our Risk Insight Platform is completely separate from this $120 million.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And can we get some idea at all on the -- I know there was some commentary made about investments this quarter on the new clients for health care exchanges. I'm trying to get an understanding since inception on what kind of investment has been made in the construction of the health care exchange platform. And then going forward, what kind of investment upkeep or run rate investment growth is going to be required in that business?
Gregory C. Case: What we said basically is we've invested -- we explicitly said, as we were bringing this up and online, greater than $100 million investment. What we said, going forward, there will be -- continue to be substantial investments. And by the way, bringing large clients on is a great cause for celebration for us. We -- a phenomenal validation of what we're doing, very reinforcing. What we said is all future investments, we're going to fully fund out of the P&L. And what you need to hear from us is the following, exactly what Christa described, is we are delivering in HR Solutions mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth for 2014. And so while there have been investments greater than $100 million we described before, we are absorbing them all in the P&L, and by the way, delivering greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth for '14. So that's really how you should think about it.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And just a last one. Christa, on the share repurchases for the first quarter, to make sure that I -- I'm understanding something correctly, with the current share count at 296.1 million, and I think in the presentation, you say the expected diluted share count in the -- for full year '14 is 295 million, so am I reading that right that the expectation is really only about 1 million shares of buyback? Is that on par with where cash flow or cash ability is in the quarter?
Christa Davies: Yes. So here's what I would say. The actual shares outstanding at 9/30/2014 were 285 million. You then have about 10 million of additional dilutive equivalents, which get you to 295 million, which is your starting point, for Q4, before any share repurchase, et cetera. And so we're not giving guidance about share repurchase in this number.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case: Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for joining us. We appreciate it very much and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc’s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today’s call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined in the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results of those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon.
Greg Case: Good morning everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I’d like to cover three areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. And third, continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics, each quarter, we measure our performance against the four metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, highlighted by solid growth in our international retail brokerage and HR outsourcing businesses. Operating margin decreased 30 basis points as continued improvement in Risk Solutions, was more than offset by unfavorable currency and an anticipated decline in HR Solutions. EPS increased 13% to $1.25 reflecting underlying operational improvement, a lower effective tax rate and strong share repurchase. Finally, free cash flow increased 5% as solid underlying working capital performance was partially offset by higher cash taxes. Overall our second quarter results reflect continued underlying progress in effective capital management, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, despite industry and foreign currency headwinds. We’re returning a record amount of capital to shareholders, that’s highlighted by a return of $1.4 billion of capital through the first 6 months of 2014. While continuing to make strategic investments that will drive greater long-term growth, strong free capital generation and increase financial flexibility. Turning to slide 4, on the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 1% reflecting solid growth in retail brokerage, partially offset by an anticipated decline in reinsurance. As we discussed previously, we’re driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solution segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage. With management of our renewal booked portfolio through client promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction in retail brokerage. New business generation of $280 million across our retail business highlighted by record new business in US retail and double digit new business growth in most markets across Asia and Latin America. Investments in innovative technology and service capabilities with the growth of GRIP and Aon Broking delivering increased operational leverage. And in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 13 consecutive quarters. An outstanding performance in today’s changing marketplace that reflects Aon Benfield’s long-term value proposition for clients. Booking on data, analytics and the application of excess capital in the industry, to previously uninsured risks. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact on pricing was flat to modestly negative; we’ve all seen continued stable market impact. We saw growth across all regions, U.S, retail, Latin America and Canada, including continued growth across all major businesses, property casualty, health and benefits and Affinity. In U.S. retail, we saw solid growth turned by record levels of new business generation and strengthening in construction. In International, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter. Exposures are stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by continued softness in many regions across Europe. Results reflect strong growth across Asia and emerging markets, driven by double-digit new business generation in many countries, with solid growth in a number of other markets, mainly New Zealand, Italy and the Netherlands. In Continental Europe, we’ve continued to deliver solid growth against sustained economic and market headwinds driven by strong management of our renewable portfolio. And while economic conditions still remain relatively fragile across many core markets; we continue to see signs of economic stabilization throughout the region. In reinsurance, as we noted on previous calls, we expect macro factors to be a headwind in 2014. Overall organic revenue growth was minus 4% and in-line with expectations. Results reflected anticipated unfavorable market impact in treaty and a decline in faculty replacements, which tend to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We saw strong growth in our capital markets transaction advisory business, as I mentioned earlier, positive net new business for the 13th consecutive quarter in treaty placements. As we’ve noted previously, reinsurance capital is at an all time high, and seasons are retaining more risk, driving an expected negative market impact, most notably in the US, but have an impact globally. Absent in an event in the industry, macro factors are expected to continue to be a significant headwind for the balance of 2014, with results lumpy quarter-to-quarter given the timing of growth and faculty replacements on our capital markets transactions and advisory business. Turning to HR Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 2% similar to the prior year quarter, with growth in both consulting and outsourcing. Underlined performance in the second quarter reflects growth in areas where we’re making significant investments in the business, including pension risk and delegated investment solutions. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt’s client leadership, understanding an influence of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients. As healthcare reform, healthcare costs and the associated financial risks continues to rise at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving; multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations, delivered at the local level. Managing and transferring risk against pension schemes are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1%, a solid performance against the strong comparable of 6% growth in the prior year quarter. Underlying results reflect solid growth in U.S. retirement, primarily from investment consulting and delegated pension management services. As long as growth and talent solutions, which is benefiting from M&A and IPO activity. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in retirement in Continental Europe. Now onto Q1, results include an anticipated unfavorable timing of revenue in compensation consulting that will be recognized in the second half of the year. For the full year, we continue to expect low to mid-single digit organic growth across consulting services. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. Growth reflects new client wins and benefits administration the projected revenue, driven by demand for discretionary services. For the full year we would expect stronger organic growth in outsourcing, when taking into consideration of seasonality of revenue recognition in the healthcare changes in Q4. Slide 5 highlights the third topic, areas of investment. Aon has a unique and strong track record of developing innovative solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs. Solid long-term operating performance combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include, in Risk Solutions, we’re investing in client leadership with the international rollout of the Revenue Engine and Client Promise to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We’re investing in innovative technology, such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world’s leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, now capturing 2.1 million trades and a $108 billion of bound premium. We continue to have a growing list of more than 30 insurance carriers; utilizing platform for its analytics and services capabilities and increasing number of clients are also adding strategic consulting services. In addition, we’re driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. We continue to align our global health and benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities. Furthermore we’re developing analytics to create globally consistent actuarial valuation and benchmarking models for health and other employer sponsored benefits. We’re also investing in the further development of data and analytics capability at Aon Benfield to strengthen an already industry-leading value proposition and client-serving capability. A great example of this is our Impact Forecasting Center, the only catastrophe modeling center integrated into our global reinsurance broker. Another example of this is Freddie Mac where we’re bringing insurance capital to bear against mortgage risk in the U.S. Finally we’re expanding our footprint through over $500 million of tuck-in acquisitions so far in 2014 that either increased scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients. Year-to-date we’ve completed seven acquisitions in the areas including flood, employee benefits and consultancy, spread in multiple geographies including the U.S., UK and the Pacific region. In HR Solutions, we continue to invest and innovate solutions in high growth areas. We’re expanding solutions to de-risk pension plans and are seeing tremendous growth in our delegated investment solutions, which fulfill our clients’ needs for faster execution of their investment strategies. We’re also providing a broader set of advisory and advocacy solutions to our clients’ employees, to enable greater choice and improve decision making under retirement options, especially important is regulatory changes around the world require more involvement from individuals. We continue to make significant investments to support future growth and strengthen our industry leading position in health exchanges for active employees and retirees. As part of our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions, covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies. As we progress through the sales cycle, we feel good about the pipeline. We’re focusing on client and employee satisfaction during the upcoming global period. And we would anticipate a solid mix of both new and existing clients with a broader range of industries participating. We look forward to updating you on our progress later this year when our primary sales cycles has ended. We also continue to invest in our industry leading benefits and administration solutions and technology platforms, including extensive mobile solutions and cloud based outsourcing solutions. And finally, we’re strengthening our international footprint to support our global workforce, with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets. In summary, our second quarter results reflect strong earnings growth of 13% including growth in each segment, underlying operational improvement and effective capital management, despite challenges from both foreign currency translation and market impact. We’re firmly on track to deliver continued growth across each segment, operational improvements and returns on investments. And significantly increase financial strength in 2014. With that said I’m now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review.
Christa Davies: Thank you so much Greg and good morning everyone. As Greg noted, our second quarter results reflect underlying operational improvement, double-digit earnings growth for the fourth consecutive quarter and effective allocation of capital, highlighted by the repurchase of 650 million of ordinary shares in Q2. I would note this is more share repurchase than we’ve done in any quarter since 2008, reflecting our long-term belief and the strengthening free cash flow of the firm. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance excluding non-cash intangible asset amortization increased 13% to a $1.25 per share for the second quarter compared to a $1.11 in the prior year quarter. Results from the quarter reflect underlying operational improvement, a lower effective tax rate and strong share repurchase. In addition, foreign currency translation had a $0.03 unfavorable impact on EPS in the quarter due primarily to a weaker dollar versus the British pound. Its currency to remain stable at today’s rates, we would expect a similar unfavorable impact in both Q3 and Q4. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 1%, operating margin increased 20 basis points to 22.7%, and operating income increased 1% versus the prior year quarter. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by modest organic revenue growth, return on investments and underlying expense discipline, partially offset by a $15 million or minus 80 basis points unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding foreign currency, adjusted operating income increased 5% and operating margin increased 100 basis points. Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. Under the Aon Hewitt program, approximately $99 million of estimated savings will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $88 million of the cumulative savings have been achieved under the program to-date, with the remaining $11 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. We have incurred a 100% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings. Overall in the second quarter, we delivered solid underlying operating performance in Risk Solutions, despite challenges from foreign currency translation and an unfavorable market impact in reinsurance, demonstrating solid underlying progress as we generate returns on our investments and manage expenses. For the first six months Risk Solutions margins were up 70 basis points including a minus 40 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, placing us firmly on track for margin improvement for the full year and continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%. Turning to the HR Solution segment, organic revenue growth was 2%, operating margin decreased 170 basis points to 13.2% and operating income decreased 8% versus the prior year quarter. Modest organic revenue growth and restructuring savings in the quarter were more than offset by an anticipated increase in expense to support future growth in our healthcare exchange business. We also had an unfavorable impact from timing of certain revenue in our consulting business, similar to Q1. In our second quarter, results were exactly in-line with expectations and management’s guidance previously provided to the HR Solutions business. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, approximately $294 million of the $303 million in total cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, with the remaining $9 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. As discussed previously we provided commentary regarding the outlook for the HR Solution segment in 2014 and that outlook is unchanged. For HR Solutions in 2014, we expect to – number one, deliver organic growth, number two, generate greater scale and improved returns from investments; three, deliver remaining savings and related to the restructuring programs; and four, deliver greater than mid-single digits operating income growth and further margin expansions towards our long-term target of 22%. Overall, we are firmly on track for greater than mid-single digits operating income growth in 2014 with Q1 and Q2 down as expected. We expect to be up in the second half of the year with the patterning unchanged, relatively flat in Q3 and up substantially in Q4 related to strong organic growth driven by healthcare exchanges. Now, let me discuss a few of the light items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses decreased $3 million to $41 million, interest income was similar at $2 million, interest expense increased $17 million due to an increase in total debts outstanding in the second quarter and cost associated with certain derivative hedging programs. Other expenses $2 million primarily including $5 million of net losses due to unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, partially offset by gains on certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately a million dollars per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $66 million interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 17.5% compared to 26.4% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by changes in geographic distribution of income and certain discrete items. As previously noted, potential unfavorable discrete tax adjustments in the second half of 2014 could cause the effective tax rate for the full year 2014 to be higher in the 18.3% effective tax rate reported in the first half of 2014. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to $301.6 million in the second quarter compared to $317.1 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased $7.4 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $650 million in the second quarter. The company has 1.6 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30th were $291 million and there are approximately $8 million additional diluted equivalence. Estimated Q3 2014 beginning diluted share count is approximately 299 million subject to share price movements, share insurance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow on page 10. At June 30th, 2014 cash and short-term investments were $726 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6 billion and overall debt-to-capital increased to $43.6 billion at June 30th compared to 37.4% at March 31st driven by an increase in total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. However, I would note that at June 30th the company held $681 million as a deposit with the trustee included in other current assets in the balance sheet, which was used subsequent to the close of the quarter to repay $681 million of notes due July 1st. Following this repayment, total debt outstanding was approximately $5.3 billion and overall debt-to-capital was 40.6%. Cash and short-term investments remain at $726 million. In Q2, cash flow from operations increased 3% to $344 million driven primarily by solid underlying working capital performance, partially offset by higher cash taxes and organic revenue growth. Free cash flow as defined from cash flows from operations less CapEx increased 5% to $284 million in the second quarter driven by an increase in cash flow from operations and a $2 million decrease in CapEx. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility. We value the firm based on a free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are three primary areas that will contribute to our goal of doubling free cash flow to more than 2.3 billion annually within the next three to five years. From the graph in the presentation based on current assumptions, we expect annual free cash flow to increase by over $600 million over the next five years based only on a reduction in cash use of pensions and restructuring. Combined with growth in the goal business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate we are well on track to achieve our expectations with a substantial cash flow generations. Regarding our underfunded pension plan, we have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we’ve close plans’ for new entrants both in plants from accruing additional benefits and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly a $138 million to $385 million in 2014 and continue to decline thereafter. Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were a $152 million in 2013, as all charges related to restructuring program have now been incurred we would expect cash payments to decline by $54 million to approximately $98 million in 2014 and continue to decline significantly each year thereafter. In summary, we delivered strong earnings growth and underlying operational improvement in the second quarter. We are firmly on track to generate more than $2.3 billion of annual free cash flow over the next three to five years. Combined with a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we continue to strengthen the firm through significant shareholder value creation in 2014 and beyond. With that, I’d like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo: Hi, good morning. I was first hoping to start off just in terms of more commentary in terms of the reinsurance market, it just seems like a sharp shift to go from the 3% growth you saw last quarter to the 4% decline this quarter and I know the competitive dynamics have seemed to intensified a bit, if you can just talk about what’s specifically changed in the second quarter a little bit more, and then also in terms of an outlook for the balance of the year, would you look for a similar decline in about that 4% range; I know you mentioned some one-time items that are – to negatively impact that number in the quarter?
Greg Case: Couple of thoughts on this. First, let’s think about sort of the evolution on the reinsurance side it has been – we’ve talked about, we’ve been talking about this last couple of years, is we talked about first more capital in the industry, we’re an all-time high, little over $550 billion at the end of Q1 ‘14, and against that we knew that there would be pressure and pressure movement on price and there certainly has been, and again largely as expected. A little maybe more in this quarter, as we said before, there is a little bit of lumpiness looking back at the business, but we expect to be offset to the balance of the year. So, generally as we said before, overall pressure in the overall market, what we would also highlight though as we’ve been talking about – look at the end of this day this is really about helping match capital with client need and while this brings about some challenges, it also brings about lots of different opportunities, as you think about some of the opportunities in the insurance linked security world, and the cap on world really bringing capital and do things we haven’t done before as we’ve have done with Freddie Mac, the example I gave in my commentary. So we would say that on balance there is pressure, no doubt. There will continue to be pressure on the second half of the year but it also marks with an opportunity. For the first time ever, we are starting to see the retentions which were going up start to actually stabilize as clients see more opportunity they have seen before to actually utilize our reinsurance capital. So, we see the market pressure. I would continue to put in context though, if we look at our overall Risk Solution business and in the context of our Risk Solutions business, we finished the first half of the year with the market pressure and with the FX pressure having grown the business, increased margin and we fully expect that to continue. We believe as much conviction now we had at the beginning of the year, but our team will finish the year with organic growth and Risk Solutions and with margin expansion Risk Solution irrespective of the other pieces. So that’s roughly where we are.
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo: Okay, thank you. And then in terms of the share repurchase we saw the level remained kind of elevated from where you trended last year and the first two quarters of this year, and then in the second quarter I know you guys did issue some incremental debt on, so I was wondering how that played into your decision surrounding share repurchases, and where you would kind of look for that number on a quarterly basis from here?
Christa Davies: So as always the least, we evaluate all forms of capital usage based on return on capital, share repurchase was high in the first half, but it will be in the second half, due to incremental leverage in Q2 as you said we did, you know, raise that quite substantially. And we also utilized cash from the balance sheet at year end 2013. And so those two things really meant that our share purchase in the first half will be much higher than the second half. We are leveraging the opportunity as we grow free cash flow to continue to deploy capital in the highest return opportunities for shareholders, and share repurchase remains the highest ROIC usage. As cash flow continues to grow, you’ll expect us to redeploy capital on our return on capital basis.
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo: Okay, thank you. And one last question, in terms of a tax rate, I know you guys mentioned last quarter about 200 to 300 basis points benefit from discreet adjustments was the level the same this quarter. And then also, if we’re looking at a quarterly basis, are there any quarters that we tend to potentially have a higher tax rate to exude as a revenue for instance, when the healthcare exchange business comes on in the fourth quarter, will we potentially see the tax rates just from that business coming on, kind of kick up in the fourth quarter?
Christa Davies: As we think about the tax rate Elyse, for the full year 2014, what I would say is our first half 2014 tax rate was 18.3%. As we discussed in Q1, we do expect potential unfavorable discreet tax adjustments in the second half of 2014, could cause the rate to be higher for the full year 2014. We’re not giving specific items for full year 2014, what we can say is, full year 2013 rate had 200 to 300 basis points unfavorable impact from discreet items.
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And then our next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America, your line is open.
Jay Cohen – Bank of America: Yes, thank you. You talked about some timing issues in the HR Solutions business, which hurt the revenue comparison should help in the second half, can you quantify that?
Christa Davies: So as we think about, it was really on the consulting side Jay, it was in our compensation consulting business. And it really decreased organic revenue growth in both Q1 and Q2. And so if you normalize that consulting organic revenue growth it would be somewhere around 3% to 4% in both Q1 and Q2, and what you’ll see Jay is that will show up in the second half of the year. And so if we think about our consulting organic revenue growth for the full year, it’s really in the low to mid-single digit organic revenue growth, it’s exactly where we think it should be. And it’s really is a patterning issue between Q1 and Q2 in the second half of the year.
Jay Cohen – Bank of America: That’s helpful. And then secondly, you guys have done a good job of de-risking the pension obligations, but we have had a drop in interest rates. Have you done enough work so that drop in interest rates this year, shouldn’t have a big impact on your pension expense going forward?
Christa Davies: As we think about pension expense Jay, we definitely think that pension expense for 2014 is immaterial and we expect that to continue. In terms of the work we’ve done in our pension plans, they certainly are closed, they’re frozen and they’re de-risked. As you know, we measure our pension, liabilities at year end for 12-31-2014, and at that point we’ll look at asset returns, discount rates and locality are the three biggest drivers. Pension expense rise is a lot less volatile as a result of the closed and frozen and all the work we’ve done on our pension plans.
Jay Cohen – Bank of America: Right, thanks Christa.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vinay Misquith form Evercore, your line is open.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore: Hi, good morning. The first is, could you give us some color on the slowdown in the organic revenue growth in the risk in insurance segment in the Americas?
Greg Case: Yeah sort of back up, is we didn’t go to the overall instead of putting in the overall commentary. We saw organic growth in the Americas on the retail side we’re actually at 2%, very, very strong in business generation in the U.S. retail, for example a record levels of new business generation. So really overall across the property and casualty, health benefits in Affinity, we saw growth U.S. retail, Latin America and Canada. So from our standpoint we have very strong prior year comp our view is, the year’s progressing very, very fine from a retail risk standpoint and we expect the year to finish well also. And again, if you step back and look at the sort of overall Risk Solutions our risk business more than offset some of the challenges on the reinsurance side, we talked about it. For us, it just reflects what Aon’s all about; we’re an incredibly diverse business, geographically, product, client segment, etcetera. And that showed up in the first half of the year on the Risk Solution side as well as showed up in the Americas too.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore: What do you think should be the normalized organic growth in the Americas?
Greg Case: Yeah, we’ve essentially talked about low to mid single-digits overall and that’s roughly how we see things will be playing out.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore: And was last year’s second half very strong, and so should we see a slight slowdown versus last year’s second half?
Greg Case: Yeah I would – plus or minus. If you look at this over the course of a year, so from us again I would say for the year, low to mid single-digits and that’s roughly what we’ve been able to achieve. I would also say as we’ve invested in the business or able to actually improve margin at lower levels of growth, we’ve got more leverage, operating leverage in the business. So that’s why we’re comfortable as we look at Risk Solutions overall, to say we’re going to grow organically and we’re going to improve margins in the face headwinds we talked about before. It’s an evolving business and our belief a stronger business than it was a year ago and a year before that.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore: Okay great. The follow-up is on margins in that segment, so those improved I believe 60 basis points for the first six months if you exclude the restructuring savings and if you exclude the FX headwinds. Do you think that pace of margin expansion can increase over time if your organic growth picks up a little bit?
Christa Davies: Here’s what I would say, we think about Risk Solutions margin for the first half of the year is 70 basis points, because we certainly include the restructuring savings because we’ve worked very hard to achieve those. And included in the 70 basis points was negative 40 basis points of FX impacts for the first half of the year, so underlying operational margin expansion of 110 basis points for the first half of the year. As we look at the second half of the year, we see that the FX impact on Risk Solutions margin will remain similar at minus 40 basis points. And we do believe that we’ll drive Risk Solutions margin expansion with the full year driven by the investments we’ve made in GRIP and the return they’re getting. Aon Broking and continue to expense discipline. And we do believe we’ll drive Risk Solutions margin expansion to full year 2014 and on track for our 26% long-term Risk Solutions target.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS, your line is open.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Hi, a couple of questions. First Greg, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on what’s going on with the corporate healthcare exchanges is and just what the pipeline is looking like, I know you kind of gave us couple of comments. And then specifically how it’s going on with the corporate, with respect to the Medicare and how that’s going as well?
Greg Case: Overall this is, we feel very good about the pipeline. As I emphasized before, for us it’s very much about focusing on clients, employee satisfaction as we go into Q4 enrolment. So that’s been absolute focus of our team, we’re very excited about some of the progress there, that’ll be our priority, but against that backdrop, pipeline’s been exceptional. And by the way, a very solid mix of new and existing clients, we’re very pleased with the industry breadth, it’s a much, much broader mix and continues to broaden. We’re also pleased with the fact that over half the clients we’re seeing are new in our cost of profits. So for us, we feel really good about the pipeline, as I said before, we’re looking forward to updating you all later in the year, once we complete the enrolment, the sales cycle I should say. But net-net we feel very, very good about the overall progress. And then on the retiree side, also equally positive, we’ve got to value proposition that is literally really focused on the retiree and exactly what they’re experience is like. And we invest heavily to sort of make that happen, as a result of that valued proposition; we’ve been very privileged to be able to serve some of the largest, including the largest client in this space. And so for us, that value proposition we’re truly focusing on the retiree experience, and has proved out very, very well. So we would say, another quarter of continued progress on the exchange front, recognizing by the way as we said before Brian, the exchange world fits into a much broader world today on Hewitt when you think about what we do on the benefit side, 7.5 million active employers in our Ben Admin business and another 2 million retirees sort of in the Ben-Admin business. So it’s a business we know well, now augmented and reinforced by what we’re doing on the exchange front, so that’s the background.
Brian Meredith – UBS: And on that topic, are you still seeing a pricing pressure in the Benefit Administration business?
Christa Davies: We are Brian, and it’s very much what we expected, it’s slightly less than what we experienced last year. So it’s mitigated slightly, but we expect that trend to continue.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Great, and last question, I’m just curious. On the reinsurance business, as there’s more and more of the capital markets activity that kind of picks up here, is that going to have a long-term depressing effect on your margins in net business?
Greg Case: As we step back – it’s in a day for us, it really is about bringing capitals to bear on client needs. And as we said before we don’t think about the sort of product or product basis, which is why in the end we invest behind this business and are very strong believers in the opportunity for our clients in this business. It’s why we’re number one in treaty, number one in facultative, number one – in the cap on insurance link security world. We think all the whole compliment as you bring it to bear on behalf of clients it creates potential great client value. Our view is recurring client value you know, our compensation will take care of itself overtime. Even though you’ve got sort of inter digital moves on specific product areas up and down, some recurring, some not recurring all the pieces that go into that. Our view is the opportunity here is substantial. Even equally exciting is the fact that we see opportunities to really move beyond, it’s just the core demand. So the things we’re doing bringing capital to bear in areas, as I described before, in the mortgage arena in the U.S. we’re really excited about. We’re excited for our clients, so for us, we’re very optimistic about the business long-term and feel like the opportunity to serve clients and create value for them is quite high. And our capability against that demand is also quite strong, based on all my colleagues leadership, so we’re optimistic and we don’t think about it product by product.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Barnes from Jamie your line is open.
Ryan Barnes – Jamie: Great. Thanks for taking my call. I just had a couple of questions. You guys recently closed on a flood acquisition, just wondering if you guys could give any parameters there or maybe the size of the transaction. And maybe also the margins, because I know one of your competitors recently purchased the flood company and very strong margins in that business.
Christa Davies: So personally just a technical thing we have signed, but we have not completed closing yet. And we haven’t disclosed the price, but I think we’re very proud of the content and capabilities that we’ve acquired to deliver value to clients and Greg you may want to talk more about the actual acquisition.
Greg Case: Yeah I think again just another example of sort of building capability in content in area we know well and we like our great deal. So this is really is a group that’s going to strengthen our ability by outsourcing services really flood placement and claims to insurance carriers. It’s part of a broad range set of programs. So we’re very excited about it and feel like it’s going to add content and capability in terms of sort of what we’re doing. It is in – back to the context we’ve completed seven acquisitions in 2014, again all of these have the same theme. How do we strengthen content capability or broaden our geographic footprint to the extent that strengthens content capability. And NFS, National Flood Services were just one example around that.
Ryan Barnes – Jamie: Okay and then lastly you guys mentioned that there was a higher cash tax payment was the headwind for free cash flow, just wanted to figure out what caused that. And should that be, should we expect that to go away going forward?
Christa Davies: Yeah I would describe that as just lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. And it really is a timing item related to prior years. And so I would not expect that to continue.
Ryan Barnes – Jamie: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.
Meyer Shields – KBW: Greg you talked about a number of areas I’m thinking like US retail that is doing very well in terms of generating growth. Are the areas that are underperforming are they – have they been consistent over the past year or so, or is there some sort of shift?
Greg Case: Yeah we’d say from our standpoint yet again one of the things that, that we’re very proud of and we’re excited about is really the global capability of Aon. And you may think about – we’re in many respects we’re a global focus group we’re in every country in the world, 122 countries. We serve a range of all the segments, large, medium size or smaller all types of sectors, all types of client’s etcetera. And that really does Meyer, in our respect sort of clear the level of stability that we think from an investor standpoint should be a very much a positive for you. So things have been flown, some areas, strong in some respects, loss in other respects you think about it 2.5 and three years ago we were talking about the strength of Europe and weakness of the U.S. and now that’s kind of shifted when you look at underlined insured values. Little strong in the U.S. dollar, little weaker in Europe, it really does create for us a truly stable, relative stable set of opportunities. Its why, as we reflect on the year and the progress for the first six months we feel very good about the progress, it’s very consistent we thought it would be. We push through the first six months grown, improved margins – context of an up and down market you could pick any specific area around the world, but we’d essentially as Christa described, we increased margin by 70 basis points including 40 points of FX so that’s over 100 basis points improvement. So for us certain things do have a flow, if anything stays down for a long time you can expect – but overall feel really good about Risk Solutions and some of the progress we’re going to be able to make.
Meyer Shields – KBW: Okay, thanks. And Christa when you look at the intangible asset amortization schedule, so there were increases in the forecast for Risk Solutions in 2015 and beyond really is that related to the flood acquisition or is that a change in sort of anticipated future acquisitions.
Christa Davies: Yes. No it’s not related to flood acquisitions; we’ve not yet closed that. It is related to other acquisitions that we’ve made in the first half of the year as Greg described.
Meyer Shields – KBW: Okay but there are no, when you put up this number. This doesn’t anticipate acquisitions that haven’t been closed yet?
Christa Davies: No it does not.
Meyer Shields – KBW: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair, Your line is open.
Adam Klauber – William Blair: Thanks. Good morning everyone. The growth in consulting expenses in the first six months how much of that growth would you attribute to the healthcare exchange investment. And can you give us more of a detail idea what that investment is actually going to?
Greg Case: Overall a large portion of the expense investment really is bringing online a number of our clients on the healthcare exchange sides as we said before. And it really is going to match the sort of – it really is across overall Aon Hewitt as we think about sort of what we’re doing. It was what I’m describing, so that’s the biggest part of the investment across Aon Hewitt in the second quarter getting prepared for year end.
Adam Klauber – William Blair: Okay. Another question in HR Solutions, I know in the past you’ve talked about – you’ve had some success helping, helping corporations de-risk retentions. How does the pipeline look to do more of this type of transactions?
Greg Case: Yes we said before – and Chris can talk about this as a client as well, in terms of what we’ve been able to do, but it’s more than a little success. We’ve actually had substantial success. One of the exciting parts about what we’re doing on the consulting from a growth stand point really is our retirement business really across the board. And that’s in delegated investment solutions, investment consulting overall, but also a sort of pension de-risk involved that’s really has been quite exceptional. And so we’ve got a broad range of clients, as we said before, all of whom have the issue around making sure they need their obligations for employees, but do it in a way that, that helps them address obviously the capital challenge, the expense challenges and the substantial volatility challenges which come with that which is – and our team’s just done an exceptional job there and that’s why we’ve dealt so well in this space.
Adam Klauber – William Blair: How is the pipeline of business going forward there is, how’s that looking?
Greg Case: Well it turns out if you travel the world it’s really strong. If you travel the world, there’s still a whole range of underfunded pension funds that have to be addressed by companies. And there the priority for them is as high as ever around trying to get that done. And we see tremendous opportunity in that going forward.
Christa Davies: And one of the other things we’d say is that the pace of regulatory changes is accelerating and that’s creating opportunities to work with our clients on the impacts of their pension plans. The U.S., the UK and Canada have all had recent regulatory changes proposed or implemented. And we’re addressing areas such as the pension risk as Greg described, lump sum windows, liability driven asset allocations and planned designs. And I can certainly say as a client its one of the best parts of the Aon Hewitt acquisition, is having the team of – from AON Hewitt actually help us navigate through our pension challenges and they’ve done an exceptional job.
Adam Klauber – William Blair: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Paul Newsome – Sandler O’Neill: Good morning. And thanks for the call. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your financial leverage as we look out over the next couple of years and maybe the relationship between coverage ratios. And it looks like – you tell meif I’m wrong, that you would probably be raising more debt as the pension liability goes down as well. Is that fair assessment?
Christa Davies: Yeah, so Paul, we would say that we certainly as we grow EBITDA and grow free cash flow, we do expect to sort of grow leverage overtime. And obviously as the pension on some of the liability comes down, that creates further opportunity. We’re very proud of the fact that we’re able to take advantage of the market and increase leverage during the quarter. And in particular do 550 million of that 800 million U.S. debt placement at 30 year, which is managing liquidity in a very good way for shareholders. And so we will continue to manage our current investment grade rating, it’s very important to us for our clients and for the future financial flexibility around leverage and coverage ratios, to ensure that we continue to manage those. As you said, as free cash flow and EBITDA grows and then as the lumps on pension liability comes down we expect to increase leverage over the coming years.
Paul Newsome – Sandler O’Neill: And then just to be careful on the reinsurance fund separately, last quarter, I think you said that you expected organic growth for reinsurance for the year to be sort of flat to positive, is that outlook changed?
Christa Davies: Yeah, I think from our standpoint as we reflect sort of think about through the, where pricing was market pressure was, sort of in the mid-term renewals, we would see slightly more negative than that at this point in time just given where things have played out, but we still step back and say, to be really clear, in the Risk Solutions overall that has it, essentially we are going to grow that as organically across the board and improve margin. And so this is really back to a question from before, sort of our overall portfolio, at some point of time we’ll be talking about the robustness of the reinsurance and pressures elsewhere at this point, little more pressure than we expected, but not unmanageable and we expect, as I said, have growth in Risk Solutions throughout the year with improve margins.
Paul Newsome – Sandler O’Neill: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Greg, maybe – kind of trying to square you mentioned North America new business is very strong and you talked about retention there, it looked like organic, though organic was 2%, that was little bit less than kind of we are looking for, so I am just trying to square lower organic growth with your really strong new business and that return to mid years maybe there’s a plug missing there? Thanks.
Greg Case: There isn’t too much – again there’s not that much of a difference in terms of the overall sort of decline as you’re describing a point, but we look at a couple of things as we lay them out, Michael, one is we are the underlined sort of what’s the good quality, what’s going on in the business, and that’s what we’d say before, new business was as, all time high. It was up substantial, it was up substantially. Renewals were also strong. When you look at something called rollover which is literally not just retaining the client, retaining the business but also how much is bought or what it looks like, and if you think about that, that’s – with the rollover’s decline slightly. If you look at pricing, overall, we basically look at exposure times rate, that gets you to something we call market impact. And market impact, it was down a bit, not hugely, but if you think about last four quarters just to be precise and we can’t with GRIPs. So this is exactly what’s reflected in our system, it’s actually or cross our entire system, I’ll just go in that direction. We were 0.83 in Q3 2013. In Q4 2013 0.92, in Q1, 2014 0.24 and we are down a little bit in Q2 2014 so, roughly at the same place. So, in essence we’re seeing a bit more of marketing that is not substantial, it’s not like we are seeing on the reinsurance side but it’s there and sort of affects overall performance.
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Got it. And I guess, you mentioned GRIP, a bit there as well and I am just curious over this period of time where we’ve seen some softness particularly on the reinsurance side, how much has your insurer take up a GRIP increased. I would imagine that potentially as insurance companies are maybe more aggressive about trying to get business that platforms like GRIP could see, bigger takeaway, have you seen any of that corresponding or is it been sort of a continuation of an adoption trend that you saw, two years ago or something like that?
Greg Case: It’s been a continued trend. We haven’t tried to push it, what we do is with GRIP, it’s very clear, we’ve got more than 30 markets where we are fully engaged on the GRIP platform now. This is very much around matching their capital with client need. Obviously we guarantee nothing but we do as we put them in a position where they can actually add value to our clients than a more précised and sustaining way and that actually creates significant opportunity for them. That’s the value of proposition behind GRIP. That’s worked very, very well continues to work very well, and our carriers get, we believe tremendous value out of it because our clients get tremendous value out of it. So from our standpoint we continue to grow the business, we continue to add on the wise component around it to truly help carriers add value not just in areas around coverage, new laws what they provide at the marketplace. So from our standpoint, we are very pleased with the progress of GRIP, it continues, and we think it’s a way to use data and analytics to help clients, make choices would be different and our markets bring things to – on behalf of clients that are different. And so, for us it’s been positive, we think that will continue.
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: And how relevant of a tool is that to potentially offset the negative impact of pricing in certain markets as far as your margins are concerned?
Greg Case: Well, from our standpoint as Christa said, the margin improvement for Aon is really a function of, we’ve created greater operating leverage for our business and we’ve done it through Aon Broking and all the things we do as far as we think about our pricing premium on behalf of clients. We’ve done it through GRIP, we’ve done it through expense reduction. And so from our standpoint all things sort of contribute to this. These are fundamental investments to change the way we go about the business and in turn help our clients and in turn Aon improved margins at lower overall growth. And so in the end for us, that’s why we believe this is really an opportunity to see our investments pay off, and it’s why as I said before, Risk Solutions, we believe will organically, we will improve margins in the face of whatever, where the headwinds are out there. Specifically now to your question, the biggest driver, one of the biggest drivers of margin improvement’s going to be, is going to be component like GRIP.
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh [indiscernible] from Deloitte. Excuse me.
Unidentified Analyst: [indiscernible] from Deloitte now. Hello, everyone, how are you?
Greg Case: Hey, Josh, we will get that name right.
Unidentified Analyst: No worries, no worries. Maybe, – look I understand that Christa is not going to give any guidance around the discreet tax movements but maybe you could educate me a little bit on cash taxes versus GAAP taxes. And are the numbers coming through on tax and related to cash paid and there is some a steadier number if we looked on a GAAP basis or incurred basis, I am no tax expert but maybe you can teach me a little bit?
Christa Davies: Yeah, so here’s what I would say Josh, as you think about the cash taxes we are paying you really need to look at it over multi-year period of time, because a lot of what we are paying out in cash taxes today, a resolutions of prior years. And so, there always is going to be a lag between what gets reported in GAAP taxes and what’s gets reported in cash taxes. So I hope that helps.
Unidentified Analyst: Net-net, can you tell me if the deferred tax liability on the balance sheet is rising as you have these low tax quarters?
Christa Davies: I actually – I am not sure I can answer that question?
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Well that was my only question. I appreciate it, thank you.
Christa Davies: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley: Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. Just pulling off the tax, you said the – in 2013 the effective tax rates 200 to 300 basis points higher if you exclude the unfavorable discrete items, so to that point the underlying tax rate about 22% and in the first half with all these discrete items your tax rate is 18%, I just wonder if you look back and see the downside to the UK, your tax rate at that time is it like 28%, you said you could improve more than 500 basis points, by now, are you already exceeding that target, just wonder going forward, will that 18% tax discrete item be a run rate or it could have been to improve further?
Christa Davies: Yeah, so what we said at the time we moved to the UK in 2012 was originally more than 500 basis points, so, if you took a $0.29 is attractive 500 basis points you get $0.24, then you do more than 23, more than 22, which as you pointed out is roughly the underlying rate for 2013. And really what we said for 2014 is that 18.3% which is the first half tax raise, it’s more than likely that we’ll expect unfavorable discrete tax adjustments in the second half that could cause the rate to be half of full year 2014. And while we are not giving guidance for ‘14 the full year 2013 rate did have 200 to 300 basis points of unfavorable impacts from discrete items. In terms of future year guidance which unfortunately, at the time we are not giving out future year guidance.
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley: Thanks for that. And then on the acquisition it looks like it’s picking up a little bit, so I think that 2010 can, I just wonder have that changed your capital margin priority between buybacks and acquisitions?
Christa Davies: Absolutely not, as we said earlier, we evaluate all forms of capital usage based on return on capital, share repurchase remains the highest return on capital usage for the company which is why you saw us do $650 million in Q2 and $1.25 billion of share repurchases in the first half of the year. It’s some of the highest about the share repurchase we’ve done in the company’s history. As Greg said, we’ve actually returned $1.4 billion on capital through share repurchase and dividends in the first half of the year. And really what you see us doing is for us to actually allocate capital M&A, it has to have a higher ROI seasoned share repurchase. And we have done some fantastic concurrent capabilities to deliver to clients, NFS – employee benefits certain terrific concurrent capabilities out there, that have substantial return on capital associated with them, but under no circumstances has our capital allocation process changed.
Greg Case: In this respect Kai what you really see is within the context of the exactly the priorities as Christa described our ability to actually return capital and actually strength of our business it’s pretty strong. And highlight the sudden acquisitions really across the board in the UK, New Zealand really in the U.S. surely really across the board. So our ability to strengthen the business and return substantial capital to share holders given our view on where we are on valuation and opportunity, we think is actually quite high.
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley: Thank you last question. I just wondered if you could offer your opinion on the recent loadings on the ACA subsidiaries and what potential impact on the prior year’s tend to site?
Greg Case: Yeah from our standpoint as we said before, our focus really is on serving clients day in, day out and doing it sort of on the private side. We think the demand for that is actually quite high and will continue to be. And by the way demand is function of clients just want to do the right thing on behalf of their employees and doing in a way, that they, they create greater transparency, greater choice. And really changes in behavior that actually hopefully improved health of their employees and in doing so actually strengthen the capability of companies to sort of fund that in a regional and productive way. So that’s our focus that’s the area that Aon Hewitt spends all their waking hours thinking about as they think about exchanges as we said before. Lot of other things we do across business and I am not going to comment sort of on the public sector input on that because in our view the private sector demand is going to be quite high and that’s our focus.
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley: Thank you so much.
Christa Davies: Thank you Kai.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time I’m showing no further questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you our next question comes from [indiscernible] from Columbia Management. Your line is open
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much for fitting me in I appreciate that so just a follow up on Kai’s question. So the normal and I know we can’t really be precise about this but the normalized tax rate was something like 22% or 22.5% last year I think if I have right that the first half discreet items in the tax rate. It sound like the normalized first half tax rate is something in the order of 21%. My first question is that right and then secondly we are still seeing tax rate decreases when you measure your tax plans and guided to 500 basis points or more. I guess there were certain activities you had in mind, certain strategies you had in mind. Have you essentially completed those activities or are there more things you can do?
Operator: One moment please. Sir please standby. I think we lost connection with speaker. Please standby. Thank you for standing by we are instructed by the speakers that today’s call has ended. If you have any further questions do please contact them. Again, I do apologize today’s conference call has ended for today. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-04-25 08:30:00) =====
Executives:  Greg Case - President & CEO Christa Davies - CFO 
Analysts:  Brian Meredith - UBS Adam Klauber - William Blair Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Meyer Shields - KBW Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets  
Operator:  Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc’s First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from statements that are subject to certain risk and those that are anticipated information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in press release covering our first quarter results, as well as have been posted to our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.
Greg Case:  Thanks very much and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover three areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. and third is continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the four metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 3. In the first quarter, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, driven by solid growth across Risk Solutions. Operating margin increase 30 basis points primarily reflecting strong margin improvement in our Risk Solution segment. EPS increased 15% or $1.28 reflecting strong operating performance, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management. And last free cash flow decreased 60 million in our seasonally weakest quarter as solid underlying performance was more than offset by timing of certain payments in the quarter. Overall our results reflected solid start to the year driven by strong performance in Risk Solutions and double digit earnings growth. As we invest in innovative solutions and strength our industry-leading platform the long term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility. We’re returning a record amount of capital to shareholders highlighted by the repurchase of 600 million of ordinary shares in the quarter and the recently announced 43% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. Turning to slide 4, on the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter the growth of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% reflecting solid growth across all businesses. As we have discussed previously we’re driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our risk solution segment for long term growth and improved operating leverage. With management of our renewal booked through client promises and retention rates of more than 90% on average highlighting strong client satisfaction in retail brokerage. New business generation of more than 240 million across our retail business with double digit new business growth in many markets globally across Latin America, Asia and the EMEA region. Investments in innovative technology and service capabilities with the growth of GRIP and Aon Broking deliver increased operating leverage and in our core treaty reinsurance business net new business trends have now been positive for 12 consecutive quarters or three full years, a truly outstanding performance reflecting Aon Benfield's long-term value proposition for clients. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4% a solid performance to strike despite a strong comparable in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be relatively stable across the region and the impacts from pricing was modestly positive on average reflecting a steady pace of market impact. We saw growth across all regions, U.S, retail, Latin America and Canada including growth across all businesses, property casualty, health and benefits and Affinity. In U.S. retail growth was driven by solidly business generation while strong management of the renewal portfolio drove growth in Latin America and Canada. In International organic revenue growth was 3%, exposures continue to be stable and the impacts on pricing was modestly negative on average driven by continuous softness in many regions across Europe. Results reflect strong growth across emerging markets in Asia with solid growth in number of other markets, New Zealand, Germany and France to name a few. In Continental Europe with leadership positions across this region we continue to deliver solid growth against the same economic and market headwinds driven by strong management of our renewable portfolio and new business generation in a number of countries. Well macroeconomic conditions still remain relatively fragile across many core markets; we’re seeing signs of economic stabilization in this region. In reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. Results were a bit stronger than anticipated driven by solid growth in (indiscernible) replacements and capital markets transaction advisory services which tend to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. In treaty as mentioned before net new business won was positive for the 12th consecutive quarter offset by an anticipated unfavorable market impact. As we have previously noted record capacity continues to be available to meet demand and cedents are retaining more risk, driving expected negative market most notably in the U.S. Absent in an event in the industry, macro factors will continue to be a headwind in the balance of 2014. Against those headwinds, we expect our results to reflect flat to modest growth for the full year highlighted by continued positive net new business trends and growth at our capital markets and advisory transactions business. Overall, this level of performance and strength in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's unmatched level of investment and long-term value proposition for clients, while strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability. Turning to HR Solutions, overall, organic revenue growth was 1% similar to the prior year quarter with modest growth across both consulting and outsourcing. Underlying performance in the first quarter reflects growth in areas where we’re making investments in the business, including HR BPO, investment consulting and delegated investment solutions. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding an influence of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risks continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving; multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations, delivered at a local level. Managing and transferring risk across and against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1% similar to the prior year quarter. Underlying results reflect solid growth in compensation consulting and across our retirement business for investment consulting and delegated pension management services. Despite continued economic weakness in Continental Europe we’re capitalizing on high demand areas for our clients around the globe on the effective regulatory changes in the retirement space and the increased IPO market activity and mergers and acquisitions. Results in the quarter include an anticipated unfavorable timing of revenue in compensation consulting, that will be recognized in the second half of the year. For the full year we continue to expect low to mid-single digit organic growth across consulting services. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 1% similar to the prior year quarter. We saw modest growth in HR BPO driven by new client wins and in benefits administration we saw modest growth driven by demand for discretionary services, partially offset by certain client losses that have become less of a headwind throughout 2014. For the full year we would expect stronger organic growth in outsourcing, we’re taking into consideration of seasonality of revenue recognition in the health exchanges. Slide 5 highlights the third topic, areas of investment. Aon has a unique position and strong track record of developing innovative solutions to help solve problems that create differentiated value and response to specific client needs. Solid long-term operating performance combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include, in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership with the international rollout of the Revenue Engine and Client Promise to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We're investing in innovative technology, such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, now capturing over 2 million trades and over a $100 billion of bound premium. We continue to have a growing client list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and services capabilities. In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. Our sidecar facility with Berkshire Hathaway was a first to market solution in this area. The ability to accurately match clients with the right sources of capacity is becoming increasingly important with the growing contribution of third party capital in the market. And we continue to align our global health and benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and the brokerage capability. And we’re investing in further development of data and analytics capability at Aon Benfield to strengthen our already industry-leading, client-serving capability. A great example of this is our Impact Forecasting Center, the only catastrophe modeling center integrated slowly into a global reinsurance broker which enabled us to provide real time information on catastrophic events and analyze the financial locations for our clients as incidents unfold. And finally we’re expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients. In HR Solutions, we continue to invest in innovative solutions and high growth areas. We’re expanding solutions to derisk pension plans and are seeing tremendous growth in our delegated investment solutions which will fulfill our clients’ needs for faster execution of their investment strategies. These investment solutions are also helping us expand our services and other asset pools such endowments, foundations and insurance companies. We’re also providing a broader set of advisory and advocacy solutions to our clients' employees to enable greater choice and improve decision making on their retirement options especially important is regulatory changes around the world require more involvement from individuals. We continue to make significant investments to support future growth and strengthen our industry leading position in health exchanges through active employees and retirees. As part of our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies. Nearly 1 million employees, retirees and their eligible dependents will serve through Aon suite of health exchanges for coverage in 2014. The clients on our active exchange, the average cost increase in fully insured premium for 2014 was 5.1% including fees associated with the Affordable Care Act which compares favorably to industry data reflect in the average healthcare cost increase for large U.S. employers for comparable plan designs which was approximately 6% to 8%, an outstanding result as not only benefiting and bending the cost curve for healthcare for clients but eliminating the volatility previously associated with our self-insured medical plans. Equally important, client satisfaction through the enrollment period was outstanding with 87% of employees have been likely the ability to choose among multiple carriers with great transparency and comparable information. Overall our pipeline of total (indiscernible) we expect enroll in 2014 continues to grow and we look forward to updating you on our progress later this year when our primary sale cycle has ended. We also continue to invest in our industry leading benefits and administration solutions, technology platforms including expenses mobile solutions in cloud based outsourcing solutions. And finally with strength in our international footprint to support our global workforce with investments in key talent and capability across emerging markets. In summary, we delivered organic revenue growth across both segments. Expanded margin while continuing to make strategic investments that will drive greater long term growth and operating leverage and deliver double digit earnings growth as well as a returning record levels of capital to our shareholders. Moving forward we are firmly on track to improve the operational performance, and significantly increase financial strength in 2014. With that said I’m now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much Greg and good morning everyone. As Greg noted our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year with strong operational performance and effective allocation of capital highlighted by the repurchase of 600 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. I would note this is more share repurchase than we have done in any quarter since 2008. Now let me turn to financial results for the quarter on page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance excluding non-cash intangible asset amortization increased 15% to a $1.28 per share for the first quarter compared to a $1.11 in the prior year quarter. Results from the quarter reflect strong operating performance in our risk solution segment, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management. Lastly foreign currency translation had no material impact on EPS in the quarter. Its currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a modest unfavorable impact in each quarter for the rest of 2014. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin increased 110 basis points to 23.6%, and operating income increased 6% versus the prior year quarter. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by organic growth across all major businesses, $11 million of restructuring savings and underlying expense discipline. Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled in concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. Under the Aon Hewitt program, approximately $99 million of estimated savings will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $80 million of the cumulative savings have been achieved under the program to-date, with the remaining $19 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. We have incurred a 100% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings.  In Q1, we delivered solid underlying operating performance in Risk Solutions, despite continued economic uncertainty in a number of regions around the globe and an unfavorable market impact in reinsurance placing us firmly on track for margin expansion for the full year and continued progress towards our long term target of 26%. Turning to the HR Solution segment, organic revenue growth was 1%, operating margin decreased a 100 basis points to 13.3% and operating income decreased 6% both at the prior year quarter. Modest organic revenue growth and restructuring savings from the quarter were more than offset by an increase in expense to support our future growth in our healthcare exchange business and as Greg previously described an anticipated unfavorable impact from timing of certain revenue in our consulting business. Our first quarter results were exactly in-line with expectations and management’s guidance previously provided to the HR Solutions business. With respect to the Aon Hewitt’s restructuring program approximately $280 million of the $303 million in total cumulative savings has been achieved under the program, with the remaining $23 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. As discussed in the previous quarter we provided commentary regarding the outlook for HR Solution segment in 2014 and that outlook is unchanged. For HR Solutions in 2014 we expect to number one deliver organic growth, number two, generate greater scale and improve returns from investments. Number three; deliver remaining savings related to the restructuring program. And number four deliver greater than mid-single digit operating income growth and further margin expansion towards our long term target of 22% with the patenting unchanged, down in the first half both Q1 and Q2 and up in the second half flat in Q3 and up substantially in Q4. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9, unallocated expenses increased $2 million to $43 million reflecting an increase in long term employee incentive compensation programs. Interest income increased $1 million to $2 million. Interest expense increased $6 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding and cost associated with certain derivative hedging programs. Other income of $1 million primarily includes gains on certain long term investments. Going forward we expect the run-rate of approximately a $1 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 18.9% compared to 26.1% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2014 was favorable impacted by changes in the geographic distribution of income and is in-line with our previous expectation of more than 500 basis point reduction over the long term. However, potential unfavorable discreet tax adjustments in future quarters of 2014 could cause the effective tax rate to the full year 2014 to be higher than the effective tax rate reported in Q1, 2014 of 19.9%. Lastly average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 307.2 million in the first compared to 320 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased 7.2 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately 600 million in the first quarter. The company has 2.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on March 31, were 296.5 million [ph] and there are approximately 9 million additional diluted equivalents. Estimated Q2, 2014 beginning diluted share counts is approximately 305 million subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow on page 10. At March 31, 2014 cash and short term investments were 678 million and total debt outstanding was approximately 4.7 billion. Overall debt to capital increased to 37.4% at March 31 compared to 35% at December 31, primarily driven by an increase in total debt outstanding. In Q1, cash flow from operations decreased by $65 million to a use of $11 million. The first quarter is historically our seasonally weakest quarter from a cash flow perspective due primarily to annual incentive compensation payout. Organic growth and $64 million of unfavorable timing more than offset solid underlying working capital performance and a decrease in both pension contributions and cash taxes in the quarter. We would expect the impact from unfavorable timing to reverse itself in the second quarter. Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations, less CapEx decreased by $60 million to a use of $66 million in the first quarter driven by a decrease in cash flow from operations partially offset by a $5 billion decrease in CapEx. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There is three primary areas that will contribute to our goal of doubling free cash flow to more than 2.3 billion annually within the next 3 to 5 years. From the chart in the presentation based on current assumptions we expect annual free cash flow to increase by over 600 million over the next five years based only on a reduction in cash used for pensions and restructuring. Combined with growth in the core business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate we’re well on track to achieve our expectations for substantial cash flow generations. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we have closed plans for new entrants, frozen plans from incurring additional benefits and continued to derisk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly a 138 million to 385 million in 2014 and continue to decline thereafter. Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were 152 million in 2013 as all charges related to restructuring program have now being incurred would expect cash payments to decline by 54 million to approximately 98 million in 2014 and decline significantly each year thereafter. In summary, our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year with strong operating performance and effective capital management placing us firmly on track to generate more than 2.3 billion of annual free cash flow over the next 3 to 5 years. Combined with a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we have positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation in 2014 and beyond. With that I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.
Brian Meredith - UBS:  Hey Christa I guess a couple of questions for you here, the first one, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on your comments with respect to the tax rate and some discreet tax adjustments we will see here going forward, perhaps you can give us some thoughts and kind of where the tax rate could potentially end up for the year?
Christa Davies: I think the comments I made in my prepared remarks were essentially that the rate we saw in Q1, 2014 we may expect the full year rate of 2014 to be higher than that Q1, 2014 rate of 18.9%. Brian we’re not giving specific guidance for 2014 but what I can say is that the full year tax rate could be higher because of unfavorable discreet tax adjustments in future quarters and if we looked at 2013 we did have 200 to 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from discreet tax items.
Brian Meredith - UBS: So you are saying higher than the 18.9% not necessarily higher than last year?
Christa Davies: Correct. That’s right.
Brian Meredith - UBS: And then the second question Christa I wonder if you could talk a little bit about share buyback in the quarter. Little surprised that how high it was particularly given this is your weakest cash flow quarter. Is this something that we could expect going forward that despite the weak cash flows you generally have in the first quarter, you could have significant share buyback?
Christa Davies: Yes Brian, we would actually say that if you looked at the share repurchase in the quarter it was higher than we expected and it's higher than we would normally do in Q1 given it is our seasonally weakest quarter, we did take a significant amount of cash off the balance sheet and so that was a big portion of what you saw contributing to that share repurchase for the quarter. As we think about the rest of the year we would not change expectations for share repurchase and we would really say it, we think about overall cash flow allocation, return on capital the way in which we allocate free cash flows as you know and share repurchase remains our highest return on capital use of cash.
Brian Meredith - UBS: The fact that you bought back so much stock, this is for Greg also, reflect your investment spend you anticipate for the year as well as maybe what’s your thoughts are on the M&A environment here?
Christa Davies: Yes so I guess what I would say Brian is we definitely have a discounted cash flow view of the firm and we repurchased stock based on that discounted cash flow view of the firm and so what you’re seeing in Q1 is definitely a reflection of the value we see at Aon and how much we think it's going to grow overtime.
Greg Case:
 :
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Klauber with William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair:  On health exchanges benefit administration segment, from what we understand this selling season actually kicked off pretty early, it actually kicked off real more year-end I guess, when is that so and along with that I guess clients comfort level looking at new benefit platforms compared to year ago.
Greg Case: I would say Adam this is really a conversation we have with clients all the time, there really is that a defined selling season per say. There is a decision point where clients have to get comfortable if we’re going to make different changes that they really are comfortable to explain and make sure their employees know exactly what they are doing to really enforce the benefits they are providing. So that’s really a continued, I would say the activity as you wanted to think about that continues to be very, very strong. Our clients are excited about the opportunities to support their employees more effectively and take some steps to think about their overall cost curve and how they can shape that in context of really serving their employees better.
Adam Klauber - William Blair: And just one follow-up, it seems like this business is relatively seasonal, that obviously a lot of enrollment season comes year-end and implementation of new systems comes couple of months before that. How are you trying to smooth out some of that infrastructure, some of that seasonal infrastructure?
Greg Case: Well I would say couple of things, first of all remember this is an investment we’re making in the business that’s growing well and there are a set of characteristics that the revenue is captured more in the fourth quarter and lot of the investments are in the first, second, third quarter as you ramp up and part of the reflection now it is our success and actually bringing clients onboard and we’re making investments to do that. So we’re quite comfortable with this, we have a high degree of predictability in terms of what’s going to happen which is why we’re comfortable saying we’re going to grow operating income mid to greater single digits for the year which is what we’re thinking about overall.
Christa Davies: And so absolutely greater than mid-single digit operating income growth for the year and as we think about this Adam we really think about it on the full year basis and we continue to make progress on health exchanges each year that goes on a return on the original investments we made and as Greg described in terms of you know client and pipeline and the experience that our clients had in 2013 which was very impressive and Greg referred in his original comments of having cash flow was only 5.1% compared to an industry average of 6% to 8%. So a significant benefit the clients are achieving, it's part of the exchange.
Greg Case: And all it really does is reflect against this annual view on the financials how do we strengthen our business to serve clients more effectively is to represent one really important step in that direction and we will continue to do that to support our clients and ultimately really drive the financial performance that comes with that.
Adam Klauber - William Blair: And one just quick final, and am I right in thinking that as the book of exchange client seasons, in other words clients that are on the exchange 1-2 years, does the margin go up on the season book of business compared to the new business?
Greg Case: Well there is obviously clearly a set of ramp up cost that comes with bringing new clients on board, ramping them onto this. So yes overtime you can expect to sort of see that trend in the underlying business which we fully expect but I would emphasize we’re very comfortable with the upfront investment required to do that for two reasons, one is the absolute fundamental benefit they were bringing to our clients, their employees and also obviously the resulting financial the result that comes with that when you’re supporting clients.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee: Just a question reinsurance, brokerage and the solid organic this quarter, you mentioned good new business wins and I’m wondering if you could talk about, do you feel that’s coming from share gains from peers, share gains from the direct market or do you think it's driven by an expansion of the pie that might be happening from alternative capital or geographic expansion or anything like that, just a little more color on there.
Greg Case: Our fundamental position that really resulted in the specifics are, when we look at our treaty business we captured a very micro level sort of wins and losses and for 12 consecutive quarters now that has been very positive or have been positive for three full years and that is a function of about everything. The buy sort of we look at in terms of how we think about helping clients succeed, how do we help improve the return on invested capital, reduce our volatility and that comes from lots of different categories and whether it's in a classic treaty business where we have got the number one platform or in faculty, also the number one platform or in the whole world around capital markets in transaction and advisory services where we got the number one platform. Those three capabilities we bring to our clients on an integrated basis and our goal is not a product based goal it is a client value based goal. How do we help them improve performance? And decrease volatility? And that’s what’s led to what we believe is strong traction of the business and will continue to be going forward. 
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee: And then just one follow-up, on the capital markets side can you talk a little bit more about trends there and maybe talk about the impact that that had on the quarter as well?
Greg Case: Well as we said before, as you think about sort of we thought we will kind of be modestly positive for the year overall, we came a little stronger in the quarter that was due to facultative and some of our transaction advisory business which tends to be lumpy with little more in the first quarter but we don’t change our view for the year kind of modestly positive for the year, overall and when you think about sort of the impact on capital markets and this whole new transactions advisory piece, it could be very important particularly as alternative capital comes into the market place and if you think about it we reported a level of capital of 540 billion and it's literally an all-time high, up 7% from year-end 2012 and probably underlying that 540 billion is about 50 billion in alternative capital in the context of that just over 9%. We expect that to be a 100 billion over the next 3, 4, 5 years. So a lot of dynamics happening that our clients did react to which means we have to help and think about it and react to that which is one of the real strengths of what we bring to the table and why we’re excited about this platform and how we can help clients going forward.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee: Just one really quick item, to just on the tax rate again and the discreet items that you talked about that could happen later this year. Are those unusual items or do you think there are things that can recur again? I’m just trying to just think about 2015 trend relative to ’14.
Christa Davies: Yes I mean discreet tax adjustments happen every year and as I mentioned we had a 200 to 300 basis point unfavorable impact from discreet tax adjustments in 2013. There are things like prior period adjustments as we continue to close out, audit and some things like that around the globe and so I would expect them to continue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.
Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill: Is there a way to look at the organic growth in HR Solutions if we back out the impact of the timing issues as well as the exchanges?
Christa Davies: If you back out the impact of the timing, it's approximately 4% underlying to the quarter and it's very similar to some of the low to mid-single digit growth that we would expect in HR Consulting for the year and similarly for the overall HR segment for the full year.
Greg Case:
 :
Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill: And then little bit broad question, you and Gallagher actually mentioned this in their earnings earlier that the organic growth for your business seems to be increasingly backend loaded and is that purely a function in your opinion of what’s going on with the exchanges and maybe even talk about mechanically why that’s happening but also are there other factors that are affecting the organic growth from your business that means that you’re just seeing more revenue shift basically towards the back half of the year.
Greg Case: Paul there really isn't -- there really isn't that much about sort of structural shifts on there, it really is very straight forward. When you think about our risk business nothing really has changed, we have always had a relatively fourth quarter weighted in the U.S. from a renewal standpoint; by the way the first quarter is heavily weighted for EMEA. So nothing has changed at all on the Risk side of the business which is a very, very large percentage of our overall business obviously and the HR Solution side that the new news [ph] here is what we’re on the exchange front which is an offering which happens to be more fourth quarter weighted which is just because the way the enrollment cycle works. So not a lot going on here, pretty straightforward. You’re starting to see this move in HR Solutions because of the work on the exchanges.
Operator: Thank you. Next question, Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo:  I just had a couple of other questions on the HR Solutions business, I know every quarter we kind of see except the fourth quarter the margins offset to a degree by the investments you’re making in the healthcare exchanges. Anyway to sort of pinpoint the level of margin improvement we might be seeing and the rest of your book just outside of the private healthcare exchanges?
Greg Case:
 :
 :
Christa Davies: And the other thing I would say Elyse is if you think about our healthcare exchange business we will generate a modest profit in that business in 2014 which means it's dilutive to our overall margins therefore the margins in the rest of our business are growing substantially to generate greater than mid-single digit operating income growth as Greg said for the full year.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo: And then just following-up you did put that modest positive earnings kind of number out there last quarter, did anything kind of happened during the enrollment season last year and looking forward that might cause you to be a little bit more positive or are you just kind of waiting for the enrollment season to potentially update your view on that side? 
Greg Case: Well nothing has really changed since -- last year we said we would be mid-single digit that’s exactly where we were this year, we said our mid-single digits are greater that’s exactly what we’re based on first quarter and as we said things going exactly as planned. We’re very excited about progress and we’re looking forward to updating you once we finish the enrollment cycle.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo: And then just if we could spend a little bit just discussing the retail brokerage business, I know in your commentary you did point to stable exposures and some modest benefit from rate increases and I was just trying to get a little bit more of a view as we look forward for the balance of 2014 kind of how you see trends panning out there and how maybe the level of organic growth you would expect to see from here.
Greg Case: Maybe I will start that between sort of market view and just a thought on Aon. We track this with a Risk inside platform in a very granular level. So we’re tracking across our regions and across the world for everything we place and we would, if we think about we’re really talking about market impact here which is a function of both price and ensured values and if you take a look at market impact overall it's flat to slightly positive and it has been flat to slightly positive for a number of quarters, we expect that for the remainder of the year. So if you think about the overall market and the measurement called market impact flat to slightly positive and as it relates to Aon and we intend to grow our business and if it's in the environment we’re going to grow our business and we would expect -- you know what you saw in this quarter it's going to be reflected what you’re going to see for the year. Well mid-single digit growth and against the book as we’re investing to grow as I described before.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Greg is it possible, maybe Christa to talk about and we haven't talked about GRIP for a little while. I’m just curious to know how much of an impact did GRIP have on margins in risk this quarter and what’s been the take up there I don’t know if you can give us sort of notionally or how much the fee stream there has increased over the last year? Thanks.
Greg Case: We’re not going to break out GRIP as we haven't before and too much detail other than to say GRIP is really a function of all the efforts in data analytics investments are around improving our Aon broking capability and we have continued to get very strong uptake from insurance carriers and sort of their ability to use GRIP information to actually help them decide where they are going to make investments and get frankly do better in matching their capital with our client needs, that has worked exceptionally well and continues to do that. The GRIP is really part of -- its really part of the overall effort to drive to a 26% and it has actually helped us do that. I would say we’re up over 30 carriers now which is continued progress it's obviously a lot more out there but sort of (indiscernible) very, very good progress and GRIP continues to contribute to grow from a margin standpoint.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Do you think you can raise prices or do you anticipate raising prices for GRIP for current or for potentially new sign ups?
Greg Case: Yes this is not for us about raising pricing, the way it should perform. This is about really trying to drive value on behalf of our clients first and foremost and when we drive by on behalf of clients we’re really helping markets get better aligned against client needs. One of the real breakthroughs on GRIP, let's just the fact that we have got the largest data base in the world around placement information but we have got colleagues who now work with our data, working with clients, our insurance carriers to help them think about how do they shape their capital and the way that’s more value added to our clients. That is powerful that actually is what gives GRIP meaning to our insurance carriers and real meaning ultimately to our clients and that’s how we think about it.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: And then in terms of the healthcare exchanges, can you -- is it possible to understand like the amount of investment you’ve made this quarter versus last year and when do you expect, I mean clearly you’re having a lot of success and you’re gaining a lot of traction. When do you expected that sort of balancing between investing and revenue generation turn so that the margins out of exchange are consistent with the rest of your benefits business?
Christa Davies: Yes so what we would say is if you look back over the last two years we invested and therefore made a loss in exchanges. In 2014 we have said that we’re going to be modestly positive and every year after that we’re going to drive greater scale and therefore greater return on those investments and we’re absorbing the investments in 2014 to drive greater than mid-single digit operating income growth in HR Solutions and so each year that growth pass by we will get greater return on that investment and we think it is a very attractive business to be in and therefore it's worth the upfront investment we’re making and as you know we do allocate our capital whether it's organic investments in healthcare exchanges and GRIP and other things or it's M&A or share repurchase or it's dividends, on a free cash flow return on capital basis and so this is one of the most attractive segments across our entire business.
Greg Case: It's really interesting when you think about; the exchange investment is not different than the investments we made in GRIP, the investments we made in other areas on investment consulting side. What we are really focused on doing is make substantial organic investments where we believe they can strengthen our platform and we said we will fully absorb those investments and still improve margins or improve operating income as we’re in the HR Solutions side and margin on the Risk side. We have to be able to absorb those and strengthen our platform and for us that’s been one of the most gratifying things over the last few years since we will be able to make meaningful investments to grow our business but at the same time grow organically and improve margins and that really is fundamental to what we think at least is for our investors.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: And you think the 22% margin that you talk about on slide 8; at scale is that a reasonable goal or target for your exchange platform?
Greg Case: Again the 22% and the 26% are not specific to individual areas. Really the 26% is more -- is a next step on resolutions. The 22% is the next step on HR Solutions and we feel like we’re marching towards those and we will continue to do that when we reflect on a year-over-year.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Is reinsurance, how do you think about the weakness in heading into 61 [ph] renewals and how that could potentially impact you guys before than potentially including the capital markets potential activity and thanks again for all the answers, sorry for so many questions.
Greg Case: We don’t provide pricing guidance in the market on the reinsurance side. It's something that’s sort of we have got a tremendous amount of data and analytics behind that we provide it directly into our clients. We think it's quite beneficial and highly competitively positive for them. Having said that when you think about the market overall, obviously a lot of pressure out there. The new capital I described before, a lot of pressure out there but fundamental you step back and answer the question, do clients need help from the standpoint of improving operating performance or reducing volatility? I think that continues to be yes, lots of different opportunities for them to do that and that’s where we come in whether it's on treaty or faculty or capital markets and advisory business that’s what we do. And that’s why I said from our standpoint we expect to be flat to modestly positive for the year on the reinsurance side, top line irrespective of what’s happening in the overall market.
Operator: Thank you. Next, Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes just a follow-up on the reinsurance, obviously these capital markets transactions are becoming more numerous and you guys are playing a very important rule there. When you assist one of your ceding [ph] company clients in that form versus buying traditional reinsurance. From your standpoint is that more profitable? In other words if a company instead of buying a particular layer to the traditional reinsurance market will you place that or you underwrite catastrophe bond as a specific example same terms which approach is more profitable for you?
Greg Case: So Jay I would say we don’t really think about on a product basis that way. There is a kind of clinical way you can sort of parse those up, obviously one is recurring one is not, there is a whole series of things to go into that. We think of it very much around an overall client view, so what do we do to help that client succeed by the way very measurable operating performance, balance sheet, strength, volatility as I said before against that very specific set of metrics, what did I or we bring to the table and when we bring value to the table we have been very fortunate our clients are very clear about wanting to pass for value but they hold a very bar, they should and we want to do it for everybody. We all need to provide guidance, if we do we’re going to do fine economically and if we don’t there all will be challenged economically but that’s exactly the bar you want if you are providing value into the market as we’re. We want more transparency around that, more clarity around that and we think that actually serves very, very well given our privilege positions in treaty, in fac [ph] and in the capital market side.
Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Second question on a tax rate, you had talked about reducing the tax rate I think 500 basis points and you always said overtime. It just feels like that happened a lot faster than one might have expected. I know the full year tax rate may not be as low as what you saw in the first quarter but still it was quite a bit lower than certainly we expected and I think others and did something change here or were you able to recognize that tax setting quicker than you might have originally expected?
Christa Davies: Jay I would really say that we have been on a path as you to reduce that tax rate by more than 500 basis points over the long term and the rate in Q1 is very much in-line with that sort of previous expectation and I would reinforce the point you made which is we do think that the full year rate of 2014 could be higher due to discreet tax adjustments. And so whilst the Q1 rate is really a reflection of the geographic distribution of our income which does change from quarter-to-quarter as a mix of our business shifts and as you look at sort of the mix of our business Jay, you can see things like emerging markets have grown disproportionately higher than developed markets and then the areas in which we have disproportionately invested whether it's GRIP or healthcare exchanges or other areas have grown much faster than our core business too and so we do expect the mix to change over time as well.
Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So this tax rate didn’t surprise you on the favorable side at all?
Christa Davies: No, it's very much in-line with our expectation of the more than 500 basis points over the long term.
Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch:
 :
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields, KBW.
Meyer Shields – KBW: 
 :
Christa Davies: Not really. I mean we would say as Greg said definitely capital market transactions and facultative transactions are lumpy and therefore as we think about the reinsurance organic growth for the full year 2014 we would say we would expect it to be flat to modestly positive but these capital market transactions and in fact it's a much smaller part of our business but 85% of our revenue in reinsurance is treaty and so that is the majority of what you’re seeing in the quarter.
Greg Case: And obviously the margin numbers that we report are Risk Solutions margins overall and report margins on Aon Benfield and as Christa described we expect to make progress on margin in Risk Solutions in 2014, first quarter reflects progress.
Meyer Shields – KBW: Second I guess going forward if you did see this discreet tax adjustments driving the tax rate higher in future quarters in 2014 is that going to have any impact on compensation expenses either at corporate or in individual segments?
Christa Davies: As we think about the overall business we think about the total company results and as we look at our compensation we have actually done a lot of work on compensation to align with driving value to shareholders. Example, you know our annual bonuses are really based on growing profit year-over-year and the stock for our senior most executive across the company is cumulative three EPSs we report to shareholders.
Greg Case: So nothing in sort of the overall sort of compensation structure or reward structure of our senior leadership team. It's time based, everything is performance based, very, very large percentage we do is performance based. So anything that affects performance is going to ultimately affect compensation.
Meyer Shields – KBW: Last question if I can, is there any breakthrough from the significant dividend increase in terms of the relative effectiveness of share repurchases?
Christa Davies: Obviously you can see we did more share repurchase in Q1 in 2014 than we had since 2008 and as I said earlier share repurchase remains the highest return on capital we have in terms of uses of cash and look I would just say that the dividend increases are third year of increase of dividends and we returning capital to the shareholders and we will continue to you know to go on that path.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley:  I’ve two questions; one is just on the margin side. You have 3% organic growth in Risk Solutions; you showed a 110 basis point margin improvement. I’m just wondering if we sustain this sort of low to mid-single digits organic growth will we be able to see the continuing margin expansion in the Risk Solutions.
Christa Davies: Yes we absolutely think that’s the case. If you think about sort of we expect mid-single digit organic revenue growth in Risk Solutions in calendar year 2014, if you look at our underlying expense save, you know it's mostly people, there are largest expense, you know you would see a natural sort of inflationary impact of let’s call it 2% growth in expenses therefore even a 3% organic revenue growth level we can absolutely drive margin expansion that’s what you saw in calendar year 2013 and that’s what you have seen in Q1, 2014.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley: Then on the margin and the HR side, you have put out long term target 22%, I guess before the long term healthcare has changed. I just wonder the outlook for the private healthcare exchange and the margin of the business will that be sort of like increasing or sort of like be above your long term target for the business 22%?
Christa Davies: We absolutely believe that the returns on the healthcare exchange business will help us achieve our 22% margin target in HR Solutions. We haven't given specific long term margins for our healthcare exchange business but we have said that it's one of the best return on capital opportunities across the firm. Obviously the profile of this investment is we’re making significant investments on behalf of clients upfront and we expect to return that overtime.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley: And lastly on the buyback the source of fund, so I just wonder could you remind us like how much of your cash (indiscernible) was sitting in the U.S. versus international and how do you funded the buyback and through like increasing through like debt or from operating cash flow from the U.S. operations?
Christa Davies: Yes so as we think about our cash flow we really have a central sort of treasury operation, it's a combined cash pool that’s a result of our moving to the UK in April 2012 and so we really think about it as a common cash pool. If you look at how much of the share repurchase was funded from cash and short term investments on the balance sheet you saw at year-end 2013, cash and short term investments were about a $1 billion and it has come down to 678 million and so that gives you a sense that 322 million roughly came off the balance sheet. So that was a significant portion of the share repurchase contribution. I don’t know if answered every part of your question?
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley: Yes so if I just wonder of these the share buyback has to use the cash available in the U.S. right?
Christa Davies: Yes we don’t think about it like that, we have a globe cash pool.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets: I just wanted to get an idea of the investment profile that you’ve been talking about in HR Solutions and just sort of is that in people or is that in technology or infrastructure and sort of how does the level of investment is being made this year compared to 2012 or 2013 when we think about how that business and that investment is ramping up overtime?
Greg Case:
 :
 :
 :
Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets:  I guess my question is when you say those investments I mean are those people, are those teams being hired or is that infrastructure and technology? Like I’m just trying to understand when you say investment are you referring to the people you’re putting in since it's such a people heavy business or is this technology and infrastructure type investments?
Christa Davies: It's mostly people. It's also technology and infrastructure, so if you think about the healthcare exchange business it's people, it's process and it is a significant amount of technology in the platform to run a scale and so but the majority of the investment is people to service clients and that’s exactly what we’re doing and so as we think about the client growth each year the underlying expense size is going to increase because we’re serving far more clients in talent [ph] in 2014 than we did in 2013. But as we said the profitability is improving each year and the return on capital is improving each year.
Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets: And then just one other question on compensation overall, normally first quarter seems to be a higher compensation quarter on a relative basis and the compensation growth seemed a bit lower this year and I was just wondering if there is anything that has gone into that or any change on the compensation make up corporate wide?
Christa Davies: Yes so as we think about our compensation programs corporate wide we put in place a number of years ago as Greg described aligning our compensation programs with performance as delivered to shareholders whether that’s operating income growth, year-over-year or whether that’s cumulative EPS growth or free cash flow growth and they have -- compensation programs have not changed over the last couple of years. We think they have aligned management incentives with shareholder returns and therefore we have kept them stable.
Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets: Was there any benefit to the level of compensation for the company from the restructuring program? I mean I guess given the returns and the hurdles you guys have hit I would have expected compensation growth to sort of stay more in-line with last year as opposed to the growth slowdown, that’s all I’m trying to understand.
Christa Davies: I mean we obviously as we invested in restructuring we did get a return in terms of reduced compensation from those programs but we’re balancing investments in restructuring both in investments and organic ideas for the business with all of our other opportunities for investing across Aon and so I wouldn’t say that’s particularly out of line with trends in previous years.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: I just want to say to everyone thank you very much for participating with us today. We look forward to the call next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Thank you all for attending today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q4  (2014-01-31 08:30:00) =====

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter results, as well as have been posted to our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.
Gregory C. Case: Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2013 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. And third is continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 4 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 4% overall, highlighted by strong growth in our HR Outsourcing and Americas Retail Brokerage businesses. Operating margin increased 160 basis points, primarily reflecting significant margin improvement in our HR Solutions segment. EPS increased 21% to $1.54, reflecting strong operating performance, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow increased 23%, driven by strong working capital performance and a decline in CapEx spend. If we turn to the full year, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth across both segments despite pricing pressure on our reinsurance business and overall economic uncertainty in Europe. Operating margin increased 40 basis points, reflecting strong margin improvement in Risk. EPS increased 16% to $4.89. And finally, free cash flow increased 22% to $1.4 billion, driven by a record $1.6 billion cash flow from operations, a truly incredible effort from the team, as we're well on track to double annual free cash flow in the next 3 to 5 years. Overall, our results reflect a strong finish to a solid year, with improvement across each key metric for both the fourth quarter and full year. Having made significant investments across the firm in both risk analytics and the most robust set of solutions for health care exchanges, we continue to strengthen our platform for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and significantly increase financial strength in 2014. Turning to Slide 4. On the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3%. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage; with management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction in Retail Brokerage; double-digit growth in new business generation, reflecting more than $335 million across our Retail business; with strong growth across the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions; investments in new products and service capabilities with the growth of GRIP and Aon Broking, delivering increased operating leverage; and in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 11 consecutive quarters. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4%, exposures are relatively stable and the impact from pricing was modestly positive on average, reflecting the steady pace of market impact. We saw strong growth in Latin America and solid growth in U.S. Retail, including growth across all businesses: property/casualty, Health and Benefits and Affinity. In U.S. Retail, we delivered a record level of new business, with solid management of the renewal book portfolio, including record levels of retention. In International, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continued to be stable, and the impact from pricing was flat on average. We saw a growth in multiple markets: New Zealand, Italy, Spain and Portugal, to name a few, with double-digit growth across Asia. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, macroeconomic conditions still remain relatively fragile across many core markets. However, with leadership positions across this region, we continue to deliver modest growth against the same economic and market headwinds. In Reinsurance, as we noted previously, our third quarter was favorably impacted by the timing of revenue pulled forward from the current quarter and we expected a modest decline in organic revenue. Overall, organic revenue growth was flat for the quarter. Results reflect growth in our capital market transactions and advisory business, as well as net new business growth in treaty placements, offset by the anticipated unfavorable impact of timing in the quarter. As we've noted over the past year, record capacity continues to be available to meet demand and cedents are retaining more risk, driving expected negative market impact, most notably in the U.S. Absent an event in the industry, macro factors will continue to be a headwind in 2014. Against those headwinds, we expect results to continue to reflect flat to modest growth, highlighted by net new business won, which was positive for the 11th consecutive quarter, growth from investments internationally and capital markets and advisory transactions business. Overall, this level of performance and strength in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's unmatched level of investment and long-term value proposition for clients, while strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability. Turning to HR Solutions. Overall, organic revenue growth was 8%, with growth across both major businesses and in areas where we're making significant investments in the business, including health care exchanges, investment consulting and delegated investment solutions. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding an influence of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risks continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving; multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations, delivered at the local level; managing and transferring risk across and against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded; and finally, after continuing to work through the worst economic recession in the last 70 years, clients are just beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development and engagement to prepare themselves for renewed long-term growth. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 8% in the prior year quarter, which benefited from certain non-recurring pension de-risking activities. Results in the quarter reflect solid growth across our compensation consulting business and in our retirement business for investment consulting and delegated pension management services, partially offset by a modest decline in demand through actuarial services and retirement consulting. Despite weak demand for discretionary services and overall economic weakness in Continental Europe, for the full year, we delivered low- to mid-single-digit organic growth across the Consulting Services business and would anticipate similar levels of growth in 2014. In Outsourcing, organic revenue increased 11%. Organic revenue reflects substantial growth in our health care exchange business as we recognize revenue related to the majority of enrollments that take place during the fourth quarter in our active and retiree exchanges. Results also reflect modest growth in our HR BPO and in benefits administration for discretionary services, partially offset by unfavorable net client activity that we saw in early 2013 but became less of a headwind starting in Q4. Slide 5 highlights the third topic, areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include: in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership with the international rollout of the Revenue Engine and Client Promise through our greater productivity and efficiency. We're investing in innovative technology, such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, capturing roughly 1.9 million trades and $100 billion of bound premium. We continue to have a growing client list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and services capabilities. In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. We continue to align our global Health and Benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities. And we're investing in the further development of data and analytics capability of Aon Benfield to strengthen our already industry-leading, client-serving assets. Finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients. In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position and comprehensive portfolio of health solutions, including health care exchanges. Health care exchanges, as Aon Hewitt's unique business model reflects, enable clients to begin transitioning their participants to a sustainable, full-service solution based on expanded choice and a competitive marketplace. Clients continue to reinforce the value of Aon's industry-leading vision for private health exchanges, as we're seeing increased interest from a broadening spectrum of industries and geographies. In Q4, we were very pleased with our enrollment results and the excellent service experience we delivered for our clients and their employees and retirees. In the Aon active health exchange, employer participation was 6x higher, and employee covered lives tripled. We delivered on our Q4 anticipated enrollment numbers of more than 600,000 lives, including eligible dependents. On the Aon Retiree Health Exchange, we serve more than 300,000 of our clients' retirees to evaluate the best Medicare options for their needs. Overall, we're excited about our robust pipeline of clients for the 2014 enrollment, continue to see increased interest from a broadening spectrum of industries and look forward to updating you on our progress later this year, when our primary sales cycle has ended. Separately, across our HR Solutions portfolio, we're expanding in high-growth areas with innovative solutions to derisk pension plans. And our delegated investment solutions are opening relationships in new markets. We're also providing a broader set of advisory and advocacy solutions to our clients' employees to enable greater choice and improve decision making on their retirement and health care options. We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology platforms. And finally, we're strengthening our International footprint to support a global workforce with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets. In summary, for both the fourth quarter and full year, we delivered positive performance across each of our key financial metrics. In addition, we strengthened our industry-leading platform with strategic investments across data, analytics and solutions that we expect will drive long-term growth and greater operating leverage in 2014. With that said, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, we delivered positive performance against all 4 key metrics, while continuing to position Aon's industry-leading platform for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and significantly increased financial strength in 2014 and beyond. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 21% to $1.54 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.27 per share in the prior year quarter. Results of the quarter reflect strong operating performance in our HR and Risk Solutions segments, a lower effective tax rate as we deliver long-term benefits related to the company's redomicile and effective capital management reflecting the company's share repurchase program. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 13 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization and restructuring charges related to the Aon Hewitt reconstructing program. All charges for the formal restructuring program have now been completed. Lastly, foreign currency translation had a $0.03 unfavorable impact on EPS in the quarter due primarily to a stronger dollar, U.S. dollar, versus the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no material impact in the first quarter. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin increased 40 basis points to 23.6%, and operating income increased 2% versus the prior year quarter. Organic growth, driven by investments in GRIP and analytics, as well as $9 million of restructuring savings, were partially offset by a $16 million or 40 basis points unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring program, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. Under the Aon Hewitt program, approximately $99 million of estimated savings will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $69 million of the cumulative savings has been achieved under the program, with the remaining $30 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. A breakout of restructuring charges incurred in Risk Solutions associated with the Aon Hewitt program is detailed in the schedules on Page 14 of the press release. We would note that 100% of the charges have been incurred and the Aon Hewitt restructuring program is closed. In Q4, we delivered solid underlying operating performance in Risk Solutions, despite an unfavorable impact from foreign currency, continued economic uncertainty in Europe and unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance. For 2013, Risk Solutions operating income grew roughly 6% and operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.5%, placing us firmly on track for improved operating income performance in 2014, and further margin expansion toward our long-term target of 26%. Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 8%, operating margin increased 440 basis points to 21.4%, and operating income increased 36% versus the prior year quarter, in line with management's guidance. Significant growth in our health care exchange business and $18 million of incremental restructuring savings were the primary drivers of our anticipated strong fourth quarter performance. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, approximately $260 million of the $303 million in total cumulative savings has been achieved under the program, with the remaining $43 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. As Greg noted, we made tremendous progress in 2013, delivering on both our operational and financial goals that were laid out at the beginning of the year. This performance is exactly in line with our long-term outlook for the HR segment and places us firmly on track for improved performance in 2014. For HR in 2014, we expect to number one, deliver organic growth; number two, generate greater scale and improve return from investments; number three, deliver remaining savings related to the restructuring program; number four, deliver, in 2014, greater than mid single-digit operating income growth and further margin expansion toward our long-term target of 22%. The patterning will be similar to 2013. Down in the first half, both Q1 and Q2; up in the second half of the year; flat in Q3; and up substantially in Q4. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses increased $6 million to $54 million, reflecting an increase in long-term employee incentive compensation programs. Interest income decreased $1 million to $3 million. Interest expense increased $2 million due to costs associated with certain derivative hedging program. Other income of $14 million primarily includes gains on sales of businesses and certain long-term investments as we monetize our long-term investments and put the capital to better use for shareholders. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 24.2% compared to 25.2% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2013 was favorably impacted by changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain discrete tax adjustments. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 311.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to 327.5 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased approximately 1 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $77 million in the fourth quarter. The company has $2.9 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on December 31 were 300.7 million and there are approximately 9 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 2014 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 310 million, subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our significant financial flexibility and strong free cash flow on Page 10. At December 31, 2013, cash and short-term investments were $1 billion and total debt outstanding was $4.4 billion. Overall debt-to-capital decreased to 35% at December 31 compared to 37.7% at September 30. Cash flow from operations increased 18% to $649 million in the fourth quarter, due primarily to growth in net income and a decrease in pension contribution. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 23% or $110 million, to $594 million in the fourth quarter, driven by strong cash flow from operations and a $13 million decrease in CapEx. For the full year, cash flow from operations was a record $1.6 billion, up 15% due primarily to growth in net income, strong working capital performance and a decrease in pension contribution. Free cash flow increased 22% or $254 million, to $1.4 billion, driven by a record cash flow from operations and a $40 million decrease in CapEx, a truly outstanding performance. Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. As you can see from this chart, based on current assumptions, we would expect free cash flow to increase by over $600 million annually over the next 5 years based only on a reduction in cash used for pension and restructuring. Continued growth in the core business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate would generate additional free cash flow growth that puts us well on track with our goal of doubling free cash flow to more than $2.3 billion annually within the next 3 to 5 years. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continued to derisk certain plan assets. Our overall unfunded status improved to $1.6 billion and 91% at year end 2013 compared to $2.3 billion and 82% at year end 2012. We currently expect contributions to decrease by roughly $138 million to $385 million in 2014 and continue to decline thereafter. Additionally, noncash pension expense was roughly $21 million in 2013, and we would expect noncash pension expense is 0 in 2014. Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were $152 million in 2013. As all charges related to the restructuring programs have now been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $60 million to approximately $90 million in 2014, and decline further each year thereafter. In summary, we finished the fourth quarter and full year 2013 with solid performance across all 4 key financial metrics. We continued to make substantial investments for clients and drive future long-term growth in both Risk and HR Solutions. We delivered 22% free cash flow growth and have focused on 3 primary areas that will each contribute substantially to a doubling of annual free cash flow, more than $2.3 billion annually over the next 3 to 5 years. Combined with a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we've positioned the firm for improved financial performance and significant shareholder value creation in 2014 and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: A couple of questions on exchanges. Number one, has the sales cycle for benefit admin exchanges started earlier than normal and is it active? And then the second question, you've obviously put on a big jump in new clients this year on both the active and retiree. Do you have more capacity as you go into next year to onboard even more clients than you did this year? So 2 different questions.
Gregory C. Case: First, Adam, on your question on the sales cycle. I would say, this is part of an ongoing conversation with our clients around literally how they serve their employees and support them in a more effective way. So as we completed the cycle last year, it's really been a continuous set of conversations with clients. We're obviously in the middle of a sales cycle now, but it's been a really continuous set of conversations that, I must say, had been building in momentum. More clients are interested, cutting across a broad set of geographies and industries in all sizes and shapes. So sort of very, very active set of conversations. And then as we've said before, for us, we have plenty of capacity. This has been about building in a very thoughtful, methodical way on the active side, initially, with 3 companies this cycle, with 18 companies. The pipeline is exceptionally strong and we have capacity and fully anticipate adding some of the next set of clients. And most important is serving them in an impeccable way, which we were very pleased to do this last cycle. And the same is holding on the retiree side, too. So very, very, very positive set of developments and it's within the context of what we do in ben admin anyway. We serve 9 million employees in ben admin across the board now on the active and the retiree side. So it's part of a natural progression and it's proceeded very, very well.
Operator: Next question is Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, a couple of questions. First, Greg, I'm curious, could you give us some insight into what you see happening in the emerging markets right now? And could that have any impact on your business here in 2014, with the economic slowdown there?
Gregory C. Case: Well, actually, Brian, for us -- first of all, from an overall context, about 50% of our global business overall, and we've seen continued strong growth on the emerging markets side. I was just actually back -- I was in Beijing and Shanghai and Suzhou, and it was -- just tremendous opportunity everywhere. When you think about, it's obviously tied to GDP, that might be a bit of a headwind, but when you think about the level of incidence of insurance that have a coverage across per dollar of GDP, the growth opportunity in the emerging markets is just for us, from a risk standpoint, is substantial. And so we're seeing very strong growth across Asia, across Latin America, with particularly very high growth and well into the double digits in a number of countries. So from our standpoint, we -- this is a very positive industry, a very positive area of investment and development for us and we don't see that changing. And if it's great and it's a little less great, it's still in the great category.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then, Christa, I'm wondering if I can just clarify your comments with respect to margin guidance in the HR Solutions business. Did you say that you expect margins to actually be down again in the first half of the year in '14, and then flat third quarter, and then up in the fourth quarter? And if so, why?
Christa Davies: Yes. So I was actually providing operating income guidance as opposed to margin guidance. And operating income, overall, we think will be greater than mid-single-digit growth in 2014. And then some of the patterning, it will be similar to 2013. Down in the first half, both Q1 and Q2; flat in Q3; and up substantially in Q4. And it's really reflecting the continued investment we make to support our clients in health care exchanges in 2014. And as you know, we incur expenses in all 4 quarters of the year in our health care exchange business and recognize the revenue in Q4. As we continue to scale more clients, really, because of the success we've had in the 2013 cycle, we are continuing to invest throughout the calendar year in 2014. That's why that patterning is continuing to occur.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Is that because there's expense in onboard-ing the clients in the first half of the year, is that what's happening?
Christa Davies: Yes, that's exactly right.
Gregory C. Case: Brian, if you think about it, we've invested substantially -- said we would achieve mid-single-digit operating income in '13, which we did. Christa guided sort of where we're going to be in '14, which we will. Within that, we will have invested substantially sort of in the exchange side. But if you think about the categories of that, '13 was about really a lot of the infrastructure and things to get it up and running and really sort of build all the components of it, what you're seeing in the discussion in '14 is our anticipation of where the pipeline is and indications we're getting now of how that's going to evolve. And that really is going to be about specific client investment in addition to continued investment around the client experience.
Operator: Next question is Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, a couple of questions. First, I may have missed this on the call, but can you give us a sense of what the tax rate will look like in 2014?
Christa Davies: Yes, Jay, as we think about the tax rate, we've given long-term guidance on the tax rate of, sort of, more than 500 basis points. As we think about the tax rate for 2014, we're not giving guidance going forward. We have given long-term guidance and we'll report updates on progress as we report our results.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Second question, on the reinsurance broking side, I guess, I was interested in your comment suggesting that you may be able to eke out flat or even up organic revenue growth in 2014 despite what appears to be some pretty stiff headwinds, and I'm wondering why that is. And part of the question is, when you think about your compensation on the Reinsurance side, how much is fees versus commissions?
Gregory C. Case: So Jay, if we step back and think about sort of what we've done historically, first of all, irrespective of kind of what's happening on the pricing side, the exposure side, we've said we're going to grow the Risk Solutions business. That includes the Reinsurance business, and that's exactly what our goal is for 2014. And we believe we're going to be on track to do that. You're absolutely right, there is some substantial headwinds when you think about some of the capital. There's a record level of capital in the industry now, well above $500 billion. We've had a relatively light cat year and then that's fully compounded by the continued influx of capital from nontraditional sources, which is kind of at the $45 billion, $50 billion level now. We expect it to grow over time. Having said that, from our standpoint, our view is that when you think about what we do on behalf of clients, we're really helping them understand how to create value with their balance sheet, reduce volatility, improve operating performance, that's right exactly in the wheelhouse of what we do at Aon Benfield. We've invested in data and analytics in ways no one else has really been able to -- has ever done. And we believe that's going to help us serve clients effectively and that's why we believe we can continue to grow that business over time and fully anticipate being able to do that.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And the fees versus the commissions, is the decent part of this fee, does that help protect the revenue to some extent?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, no, it's a mix on both sides, so fee and commission. We're about 70% commission and about 30% fee, overall. But we're doing a number of things on behalf of clients in addition to treaty placements. Some of it -- it's really just sort of adding advice and some of the things that come with data and analytics to help them think about their business overall, that's an increasing component. I would also say, for us, when you think about our leadership position, kind of, in the alternative capital area in cat bonds as an example, I mean, just -- there's clearly an acceleration on that front. If you think about since 2010, give or take, probably been about 90, 93, 94 deals done over that period of time. We've been involved in over half of them. Now there's been an acceleration of the 93. 31 were done last year. Again, we're involved in over half of them. So from our standpoint, there's lots of aspects in how we help insurers improve their performance across Aon Benfield. And that is reflected in our historical performance. I would also just say, reflect on sort of Aon over the last 5, 6, 7 years, in virtually any economic environment, we've been able to grow the business overall. And in fact, we've grown it every year except one, in which we were just down slightly. So our view is we've seen the movie before and fully anticipate being able to grow and help our clients succeed.
Operator: Next question is Gregory Locraft of Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Again on reinsurance brokerage, it looks like organic growth dropped in '04, '05 to mid-single digits. And pricing in that environment was actually pretty bad. So can you compare the business for reinsurance today versus the '04, '05 when the pricing declines were similar? Why is it different, why won't we be seeing negative organics in the future periods in this division?
Gregory C. Case: A lot of those, I just described to Jay. I can't really speak for the overall industry, where we'll all [ph] be. I would just reflect on what Aon's been able to achieve in that exact environment. In that environment, we've been able to actually grow our position and fundamentally, this is about obviously, exceptional treaty placement as we described. But it really is more broadly about what we do on behalf of clients, insurers, to help them succeed. And in our case, the investment around data and analytics is just quite substantial. We invest well over $120 million a year, real money, cash in data -- in developing content and capability to help our clients make better decisions that, again, will improve operating performance, strengthen their balance sheet, reduce volatility. In that context, treaty placement is one aspect, it's very important, one aspect, but you're adding to that now all the capital markets choices they have, as well as just very clear views around how analytics, data, insight can actually help them make better decisions. And that's really the broad-based value proposition, what is just unique about Aon Benfield. It really has been what they've been able to do, my colleagues have been able to do over many, many years. And if you look at kind of new business generation, again, it's been net positive for 11 consecutive quarters through multiple types of environments. And we fully expect it will continue to do that as we help insurers succeed at Aon Benfield.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And so basically, you have a more robust product offering today than you did in the mid-2000s, is that fair?
Gregory C. Case: No, I would say, it's continued to evolve. We have a quite more substantial product offering. Again, if you're investing $120 million-plus a year on content and capability, it's broader, it's deeper, it's more connected globally. And equally important, we believe it's highly differentiated. There aren't many players in the industry, doing what we do, could invest in content and capability the way we do on behalf of clients and haven't had any the impact that it's had on behalf of clients. Because in the end, that's what really is what generates client leadership, you're helping clients succeed. And we've been able to do that and we believe that capability has strengthened substantially, really, every year for the period of time you described. And that's why we're in a, we believe, in a very advantaged position as we look forward.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then again, on reinsurance brokerage, the reported revenues flow kind of linearly through the year, while as the renewal cycle for the industry, is Jan 1, June 1. So can you kind of tie the 2, in other words -- and the reason I'm asking is, is do you kind of have great visibility on your revenues for the reinsurance division already based on what was bound on January 1?
Gregory C. Case: Of course, just as you said, I would say there's a substantial number of renewals that happen on -- a percentage which happen on 1/1 and then in April and then June. So we have a good visibility on the treaty front and see how that evolves, although we would recognize revenue over the course of the year. That's why you see that flatten out. But as I said before, there's a lot of activity we do on behalf of clients, in addition to the treaty portion of the equation. And all those are now part of the discussion and are active and ongoing. But you're absolutely right, in terms of how the treaty evolves, and we certainly have a -- we have a visibility on how the 1/1s played out for sure.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Perfect. And last is just on Reinsurance again. Can you just talk about your ability to flex the margin? Let's just say you get kind of 6 months out and the world breaks to the negative a bit versus planned or perhaps, it breaks to the positive a bit versus planned. How do you flex the margin in this, what's your ability to toggle the P&L?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, we think about it. And it's less about the market and it's really about the value that we provide to clients. And fundamentally, this is the absolute focus of Aon Benfield and my colleagues sort of in this arena. And when you think about as we add value to clients -- and it turns out, by the way, oftentimes, the greatest value you add for them, particularly when you're adding advice, data and analytics on top of what you do in treaty and other arenas, in times of stress, it's actually the biggest opportunity to help clients succeed. So our ability to actually provide value, have clients recognize the value and then get paid for value, we believe, continues to increase. And that gives us the ability to actually think through sort of the ability to get a return out of the business, which we've been able to do.
Christa Davies: And just one sort of set of facts, to reinforce what Greg just said, if you look at the Reinsurance revenue growth in 2012 of 5%, in 2013, it was 2%. And despite a decline in Reinsurance growth year-over-year, risk margins are up 80 basis points. So we feel very good about our ability to grow Risk Solutions margin despite the macroeconomic headwinds we're facing.
Operator: Next question is Meyer Shields of KBW.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I think I have -- maybe more directed towards Christa. If we look at the uses of cash on Slide 11, it looks the pension contribution and CapEx forecast came down pretty significantly from the last update that we had. I was hoping you could explain what's going on there?
Christa Davies: Yes, so that's absolutely right, Meyer. So I think pension contributions came down commensurate with our unfunded pension liability, which declined from year end 2012 of $2.3 billion to $1.6 billion. So a $700 million decline in unfunded pension liability, which is decreasing our cash contributions. And you could see the pension contributions will continue to come down over the following years, and that's really in terms of -- driven by improved long-term rates. And then CapEx, you can see, we finished 2013 at a lower level than we expected. And we expect CapEx to grow in line with revenue going forward, albeit from a lower base.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Switching gears a little bit, the share repurchases slowed in the quarter compared to what we saw in the third quarter. Is that -- is there anything underlying that or is that just the way things shake out?
Christa Davies: No, as we think about share repurchase, we think about return on capital and cash-on-cash returns. And share repurchase remains our highest return investment, hence, the fact that we repurchased $1.1 billion of shares during the course of 2013, despite providing guidance sort of around the $800 million level. And if you think about it, we provided original -- we did $1.1 billion in 2012 as well, but of that, $300 million came off the balance sheet. So as we think about share repurchase, we expect share repurchase in 2014 to be similar to 2013. And then obviously, excess cash we'll deploy on a cash-on-cash return using return on capital as the metric we use to allocate all excess uses of cash.
Operator: Next question is Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I was hoping we could spend some time highlighting more of what you're seeing going on within the U.S. economy. I know you pointed to stable exposure in your prepared remarks and kind of how you see the economic conditions in the U.S. impacting what you expect to see with your organic revenue in 2014.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, as we've said -- a couple of things, as you think about overall. First of all, just the broad-based macro trends right now, we described was kind of pricing environment, which has really been stable, around kind of flat overall, with an exposure change which has been modestly positive. So for us, from a U.S. standpoint, you can start to see aspects of the U.S. economy strengthening, not strong but strengthening overall. And so that's sort of the macro view of where we are. But I would say, though, in that context, back to our ability to make investments in the business and improve margin, we continue to make investments in the business and that really has helped us from the standpoint of just -- from -- and this is really around Client Promise and what we do on Revenue Engine, and all the different pieces of it, really helps us generate level of new business, $336 million across our Retail business, really driven across the U.S. as well, that is a record level for us. So we feel very good about sort of what we have in place, the investments we've made and the impact we're going to have over time as we grow the business organically, really, irrespective of sort of what happens on U.S. GDP. And in the end, if you look at the components, we've got a big construction book and that's obviously trending a little more positive, entries [ph] is a little more positive, tracks [ph] a little more positive from that standpoint. And then that puts -- and the exposures overall against those pieces are up a bit, as I've said before. And that really is sort of how we see the U.S. playing out, with some positive overall macro implications and -- amplified by what we do from an investment standpoint.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then one other question, on the reinsurance broking business, you pointed to your presence within the alternative capacity market. How big is that as compared to your overall book?
Gregory C. Case: It's very small overall. As we said before, a large piece obviously, of our treaty book. But this is a smaller percentage overall, 5% to 10%, let's say, but growing. And I'll -- what I wanted to highlight is, if you think about alternative capital, this we believe is a reality, it's an option for clients, it's highly viable. About $45 billion or so in the context of, call it, a $550 billion capital base for the insurance world. We are primary in it, but overall, it turns out to be 5% to 10% of our overall book.
Operator: Next question, Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Christa, maybe following up on Meyer's question on the kind of sources -- or the uses of cash, Slide 11. So it looks like -- so pension contributions went down on forward -- or are going to decline. CapEx, looks like it's going to decline and -- but the cumulative increase to free cash flow doesn't seem to be increasing by as much as those 2 things are declining. Is there -- if we had sources of cash, what would that look like, I guess?
Christa Davies: Yes. So look, maybe the best way to start that question is, Michael, is to sort of start with free cash flow in 2012, which was $1.15 billion. The free cash flow number in 2012 is the number we're anchoring from to double, to get to $2.3 billion over the next 3 to 5 years. And included in that free cash flow, our free cash flow definition is cash from operations, straight from the cash flow statement, less CapEx. Included in cash from operations is pension contribution and restructuring. And then, obviously, the less CapEx means this CapEx number is also included in the free cash flow number. So if you think about it and your starting point obviously for free cash flow now is $1.4 billion, because it's what we produced in 2013. And so if you look at this cumulative increase, you can basically take the $1.15 billion, add $600 million, so you get to $1.75 billion, which is just from these 3 line items by themselves, that includes no improvement in operations of our business, all our revenue growth and continued margin expansion or a decline in tax rate. And so you can see that we are making good progress towards doubling free cash flow over the next 3 to 5 years.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. I guess, I mean, and I'll take it offline, I guess. But just if I look at -- just from '14 on, because '13 is behind us. If I look at '14 on and I compare it to -- it looks like you're a couple of hundred million dollars better on pension, maybe a little bit more. Couple of hundred million dollars better on CapEx, but the cumulative free cash flow is up by about $20 million over that period.
Christa Davies: So the way to think about it is, if you look at the 2014 number and, say, it's $333 million as the cumulative increase, and then you look at the $602 million, then, from $214 million to $218 million, you've got a $300 million increase in free cash flow just from the line items above. And you add that to $1.4 billion, which equals $1.7 billion.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got you. Okay. I'll take it offline. I guess -- Greg, I guess, or maybe Christa as well, on the Risk segment, so you had -- margins were up about [indiscernible] on 3 points of organic. Where do you need organic to be overall, I mean, is that -- do you think about it that way in order to continue to expand margins? Or because of GRIP and Broking, do you feel like you have levers to continue to expand margins even if organic falls below that level.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, I would just start at the top line. Our view is we are going to continue to expand the risk margin overall. And if you look across time, I've made investments, have been able to do that and at largely multiple types of organic growth environments. And that's, in fact, exactly what we intend to be able to do. A lot of the investments around GRIP, what we've done, and analytics, have really helped create leverage, operating leverage in the business, which is more substantial. So our ability to improve margin on lower growth rates is real. And you're starting to see that actually play out in the improvement this year. You'll see that play out over time. If we happen to get continued big pickup in the global economy or we happen to get rate improvement, et cetera, not something our management team has actually ever experienced, we'd love that. That would be great. But that's not what we require in order to actually improve the margin of the business. And that's really been part of the strategy over a multi-year period to invest in the business so that we could, in fact, improve margins, irrespective of the overall rate or exposure environment.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then last one, just on the exchanges. How much capacity do you have on the exchange right now, I mean, without investing more in terms of number of covered lives that you could put on the exchange? And where do you expect to be at the end of next year, just given whatever investments you plan to make during the year?
Gregory C. Case: We have substantial capacity. Again, our goal here is to serve clients in an effective way. First and foremost, making absolutely certain that the experience that our client has and their employees have is absolutely pristine. As we've said before, we've done that through the last few cycles, feel very good about that. And now is the opportunity to continue to react and to help our clients in a much broader, more robust pipeline. We have capacity to do that. And we'll update you when we get through the next sales cycle, maybe the second or third quarter. When we have that behind us, we'll take you through kind of what the overall picture looks like at that point in time and then move forward from there. But we've got a lot of capacity as we planned it out to help our clients succeed.
Operator: Our last question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: In terms of revenues in HR Solutions, Consulting Services slowed down, Outsourcing clearly picked up a lot. Should we be thinking about a shift in dynamic, which is due to health care exchanges or are they independent of each other?
Christa Davies: They're independent of each other. And as we look at our Consulting business, we'd say it grew 3% for calendar year 2013, and we'd expect something similar for 2014. And some of the Q4 number, we really have had a very strong comparable in Q4 2012, as Greg mentioned. And so that was really what's happening there.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, and I'd add one other piece. As you think about the overall business, as I said, we're very -- we feel very positive, very pleased with sort of how our efforts on the exchange front are evolving. But within the context of broad-based Aon Hewitt and all the things we're doing there, we've made some tremendous investments on the talent solutions side, in what we're doing to help clients think about really transitioning to the cloud-based approach on HR and, really, kind of the idea of Software-as-a-Service space for HR, tremendous investments. On the retirement solutions side, we've done a lot of work in the pension space, which is very interesting, very dynamic. A number of investments there, really thinking about our delegated pension management services and what we can do and accomplish to help clients really think about overall oversight, management of their pension plans. And certainly, on the defined pension -- or on defined contribution side, we've got a couple of efforts, something called DC Nexus and SimPlus Savings you're going to hear a lot about over time. So I want to emphasize the exchange story, we believe, is compelling, powerful and emerging. But it's really within the context -- it's a small part of Aon Hewitt overall. In fact, we continue the investment in the bottom line in '13. We hope it will be slightly positive in '14 from a bottom line standpoint. But there's a lot going on across Aon Hewitt that we're very, very excited about and a lot's going on inside the Consulting business, we're very, very excited about in terms of sort of the overall picture.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. So not to -- I realize it's a small piece of revenues, but operating income, clearly, was terrific in HR Solutions this quarter. Would you say a good portion of that was due to the health care exchange impact?
Gregory C. Case: No, as I've said before, if you think about -- what we said is we're going to be able to invest in the business and invest or -- and then actually improve operating income mid-single digits, which is exactly what we did. It was actually negative from the exchange side for '13, and we expect it will be slightly positive for '14. The real operating leverage that comes to the exchanges shows up in '15 to '16, and as we continue to evaluate the pipeline and think about the -- what really has been a tremendous set of conversations coming through there, our view is that we will be at a very good place from an operating leverage standpoint in '15 and '16 and just would say again, what Christa laid out for you is that we're going to have greater than mid-single digits operating improvement growth in '14.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, got it. And finally, for Christa, back to the tax rate, so is it long run, the tax rate falls below -- you said 5 points, is that below 24%, 23%, is that how we should be thinking long-term?
Christa Davies: No, no, no. I said when we started 2012, we had a tax rate of 29%. We then filed a statement which basically said that our tax rate would be more than 500 basis points, starting at 29%. And we expect that to happen over time.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. So you got to 24% this quarter, but we should be thinking to stay at this level will be -- down in the longer run.
Christa Davies: The thing I would say is quarterly tax rate numbers get impacted by certain things like discrete tax numbers. And the 25% for the full year is sort of the rate I would look at for the full year.
Operator: All right, thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case: That's it, everyone. Thanks very much for participating and I look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that the call is being recorded, and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter results, as well as have been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.
Gregory C. Case: Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2013 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. I would note that there are slides available on our website so you could follow along with our commentary today. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. And third is continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 4 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: to grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 3. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, driven by strong growth across Risk Solutions. Operating margin increased 10 basis points as an increase in Risk Solutions margin was partially offset by a decline in HR Solutions. EPS increased 19% to $1.13, reflecting effective capital management and gains related to certain long-term investments. And finally, free cash flow increased 4%, driven by strong working capital performance and a declining CapEx spend. Overall, in our seasonally weakest quarter, we delivered positive performance against each of our key metrics. Having made significant investments across the firm in both risk analytics and the most robust set of solutions for health care exchanges, we're on track for a solid finish to 2013 and continue to strengthen the platform for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility in 2014. Turning to Slide 4. On the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 4%, with growth across every major business. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage. With management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average, a record level of performance in Q3, highlighting strong client satisfaction in Retail Brokerage. New business generation of approximately $235 million across our Retail business, with double-digit new business growth in many markets globally across the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. Investments in new product and service capabilities, with the growth of GRIP and Aon Broking globally, is delivering increased operating leverage. And in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 10 consecutive quarters. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 5%. Exposures are relatively stable and the impact from pricing was modestly positive on average, reflecting the steady pace of year-over-year increase. We saw solid growth across all regions, U.S. Retail, Latin America and Canada, and growth across all businesses, property/casualty, Health and Benefits and Affinity. In U.S. Retail, we delivered solid growth, driven by strong management of the renewal book portfolio, with record levels of retention and rollover. In International, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposure there relatively stable and the impact from pricing was flat on average, with further pricing in cat-exposed regions and softer pricing across most areas in Europe. We saw strong growth in emerging markets, New Zealand and many regions across Asia, including double-digit growth in areas such as Germany, Central and Eastern Europe, China and the Middle East. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, macroeconomic conditions still remain fragile across many core markets. However, with leadership positions across this region, we saw strong retention rates and management of our renewal book portfolio deliver modest growth. Overall, a solid performance against economic and market headwinds. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 5%. You can note that the third quarter was favorably impacted by timing of approximately 2 points of revenue pulled forward from the fourth quarter. While this has no impact on the bottom line, we do expect a modest decline in organic revenue in the fourth quarter as a result of this timing. Excluding the timing impact between the third and fourth quarters, underlying results continue to reflect modest organic revenue, with growth in both treaty and facultative placements. As we've noted over the last few quarters, record capacity continues to be available to meet demand and cedents are retaining more risk, driving expected negative market impact. Absent an event in the industry, macro factors will continue to be a headwind in 2014. Against those headwinds, we expect results to continue to reflect modest growth, highlighted by net new business won, which was positive for the 10th consecutive quarter. Overall, this level of performance and strength in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's unmatched level of investment and long-term value proposition for clients, while strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability. Turning to HR Solutions. Overall, organic revenue growth was flat. We saw solid organic growth in Consulting Services despite weak discretionary spend globally and continued economic pressure in Continental Europe. This underlying performance reflects growth in areas where we're making significant investments in the business, in areas such as health care exchanges, investment consulting and pension risk management consulting. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients, as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risk continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations, delivered at a local level, managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. And finally, after continuing to work through the worst economic recession in the last 70 years, clients are beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development engagement to prepare themselves for renewed long-term growth. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3%. Results reflect solid growth across our communications, compensation and in our retirement business for investment consulting and delegated pension management service. Despite weak demand for discretionary services and overall economic weakness in Continental Europe, for the full year, we are on track to deliver low to mid-single-digit organic growth across Consulting Services business. In Outsourcing, organic revenue declined 1% compared to flat in the prior-year quarter. Organic revenue reflects a modest decline in benefits administration, partially offset by modest growth in project revenue and discretionary services. Benefits administration continues to reflect net client activity that began in the beginning of 2013, but become less of a headwind in Q4 and into 2014. Slide 5 highlights the third topic, areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include, in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership with the international rollout of the Revenue Engine and Client Promise to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We're investing in innovative technology, such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, capturing roughly 1.8 million trades and more than $94 billion of bound premium. We continue to have a growing list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and services capabilities. In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiatives to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. We continue to align our global Health and Benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities. And we're investing in the further development of data and analytics capability at Aon Benfield to strengthen an already industry-leading, client-serving capability. Finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capabilities to better serve clients. In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position and comprehensive portfolio of health solutions, including health care exchanges. We have the industry's most robust set of solutions across large, middle, small and retiree market, covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies, as an increasing number of our employers are faced with decisions at a critical time in health care. Health care exchanges, as Aon Hewitt's unique business model reflects, enable clients to begin transitioning their participants to a sustainable, full-service solution based on expanded choice in a competitive marketplace. In the third quarter, we announced strong growth in enrollment on Aon Hewitt's corporate exchange for 2014, a further validation of our vision of private health care exchanges. Employer participation is 6x higher and employee enrollment is expected to triple to 330,000 employees or more than 600,000 lives including eligible dependents. Of the 18 clients participating during this enrollment, more than half are new logos to Aon, representing a broad spectrum of industries, including retail, business and professional services, health care, financial and a private equity health firm, just to name a few. Tremendous progress in this area. Separately across our HR Solutions portfolio, we're expanding in high-growth areas for both current clients and new markets. Innovative solutions to derisk pension plans are in high demand with our existing retiree -- retirement client base. And our delegated pension solutions are opening relationships in new markets. We're also providing a broader set of advisory and advocacy solutions through our clients' employees to enable greater choice and improve decision-making on the retirement and health care options. We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology platforms. And finally, we're strengthening our international footprint to support a global workforce, with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets. Overall, we proved the concept of these major investments in 2012, and we're fully on track to drive greater scale and increased operating leverage in 2013 and 2014. In summary, we delivered financially across each of our key metrics, while continuing to strengthen our industry-leading platform through significant strategic investments that will drive greater long-term growth and operating leverage into 2014. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review.
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, we delivered positive performance against all 4 key metrics in our seasonally weakest quarter. We continue to position Aon for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility, as highlighted by the repurchase of $500 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 19% to $1.13 per share for the third quarter, compared to $0.95 in the prior-year quarter. Results reflect the strong performance in our Risk Solutions segment, effective capital management in the quarter and approximately $0.10 from gains on sales of certain long-term investments, as we monetized unproductive capital. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization and restructuring charges related to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program. We expect that all remaining charges for the formal restructuring programs will be complete and final in 2013. Foreign currency translation had a $0.02 unfavorable impact on earnings per share in the quarter, due primarily to a stronger dollar versus most major currencies. If currency will remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a slightly higher unfavorable impact in the fourth quarter than we experienced in the current quarter. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin increased 110 basis points to 21.1% and operating income increased 8% versus the prior-year quarter. Organic growth across Retail and Reinsurance, driven by our investments in GRIP and analytics, as well as $9 million of restructuring savings, were partially offset by a 30-basis-point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a decline in investment income. Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding investments and long-term structural margin expansion. Under the Aon Hewitt program, approximately $90 million of estimated savings will be achieved in Risk Solutions within the Health and Benefits business that was transferred in 2012. Approximately $60 million of the cumulative savings have been achieved under the program with the remaining $30 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. A breakout of restructuring charges incurred in Risk Solutions associated with the Aon Hewitt program is detailed in the schedules on Page 13 of the press release. In Q3, we delivered strong operating performance in Risk Solutions despite continued economic uncertainty in Europe, an unfavorable impact from foreign currency and a decline in investment income. Year-to-date, Risk Solutions margins are up 100 basis points, placing us firmly on track for solid operating margin improvement for the full year and continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%. Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was flat, operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 15.4% and operating income decreased 11% versus the prior year quarter. A $12 million dollars unfavorable impact from the timing of certain expenses, continued investment in health care exchanges and an unfavorable revenue mix shift more than offset incremental restructuring savings in the quarter. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, approximately $242 million of the $288 million in total cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, with the remaining $46 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. As discussed in previous quarters, we provided commentary regarding the outlook for the HR segment in 2013. And that outlook remains unchanged. We expect to: number one, deliver continued organic growth; number two, drive greater scale and improved return from investments; number three, deliver savings related to restructuring programs; number four, deliver performance modestly down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, resulting in mid-single-digit operating income growth for 2013. While we've experienced some onetime items and have incurred incremental expenses and as we invest in certain areas of our business, we fully expect to deliver a strong Q4, resulting in mid-single-digit operating income growth in 2013, expanding to stronger operating income growth in 2014, as we generate an improved return on our investments. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses decreased $3 million to $43 million, reflecting a decrease in expenses related to the company's redomicile to the U.K. Interest income increased $2 million to $3 million due to higher average cash balances. Interest expense decreased $4 million due to a decline in both the average rate and the total amount of debt outstanding in the quarter. Other income of $39 million primarily includes $42 million of gains on sales of business and certain long-term investments, as we monetize our long-term investments and put the capital to better use for shareholders. Going forward, we expect a run rate of $1 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $55 million of interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 25.1%, compared to 23.2% in the prior-year quarter. The effective tax rate in the third quarters of 2013 and 2012 were impacted by certain discrete tax adjustments. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 312.9 million in the third quarter, compared to 331 million in the prior-year quarter. The company repurchased 7.3 million of Class A ordinary shares for approximately $500 million in the third quarter. The company had $2.95 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 was 301 million, and there are approximately 10 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2013 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 311 million, subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At September 30, cash and short-term investments was $726 million and total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion. Overall debt-to-capital increased to 37.7% at September 30, compared to 37% at June 30, primarily driven by an increase in total debt outstanding. Cash flow from operations was flat at $597 million in the third quarter, due primarily to a decrease in pension contributions and strong underlying working capital performance, offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes and the timing of certain interest expense payments. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 4% or $19 million to $545 million in the third quarter, driven by a $20 million decrease in CapEx. Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. As you can see from this chart, based on current assumptions, we expect free cash flow to increase by over $500 million over the next 6 years, based only on a reduction in cash used in pensions and restructuring. Growth in the core business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate would generate additional free cash flow growth. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to derisk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by $85 million to $463 million in 2014 and continue to decline thereafter. Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments are anticipated to be $159 million in 2013. As our restructuring plans continue to wind down, we would expect cash payments to decline $81 million to approximately $75 million in 2014, before declining further each year thereafter. As we continue to grow, improve operating performance and our required uses of cash declines, we expect our strong free cash flow to be a significant source of value creation for shareholders. In summary, we are on track for a solid finish and improved performance for the full year. We continue to focus on 3 primary areas that will each contribute substantially stronger free cash flow over the next several years. First, continued growth and operating margin improvement towards our long-term target; second, declining uses of cash on pension and restructuring; third, greater capital flexibility and increased cash flow from a lower effective tax rate. Combined with a strong balance sheet and increased financial flexibility, we've positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So Christa, can I just maybe dig in a little bit into the mid-single-digit operating earnings growth on the HR side? So -- and let me know if this math is right, I think in order to get to like a 6% increase in operating earnings, you would need either 600 basis points of margin in the fourth quarter, or I think you had insinuated maybe last quarter that it might be like 400 basis points, in which case you would need top line to come in like 15% higher. Is the number for 4Q, is it just the margin number? Or is there a revenue component that's going to help to drive that number into that range?
Christa Davies: Yes. I mean, there are really 3 things that are driving the Q4 timing, being sort of more seasonally Q4-orientated than previous years. The first is the seasonality of exchanges. And we've described previously that almost 100% of the exchange revenue gets recognized in Q4, so you have quite a substantial portion of revenue, as you just outlined. The second is the unfavorable revenue mix shift we've seen related to benefits administration, as Greg described, is really declining. It is impacting Q4. And the third is the savings from restructuring are really increasing in Q4. So those 3 things are really driving Q4 timing being substantially higher than previous years.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. So there's a -- and do we have any notion in terms of what the revenue impact of that? And is this really all health care exchange that's driving this margin or revenue benefit in the fourth quarter? Or are there other timing aspects that are contributing to that?
Christa Davies: I mean, a very big portion of it is health care exchanges, Michael. And I guess what I would also outline is you did see approximately $20 million of timing in terms of expenses and investments in Q3 that otherwise might have occurred in Q4.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Right. So that's maybe like 100, 150 basis points. But like you still need considerable margin improvement. So that -- okay, so there's a revenue element, as well as the margin piece. And have you -- can you give us a little bit -- any more granularity in terms of what the net margins on that business are and what sort of revenue could fall into the fourth quarter? Just curious, it's kind of hard to model it or think about it. We just don't have a lot of clarity, given it's so new.
Christa Davies: Yes. And look, what we've given, Michael, is really full year guidance in terms of mid-single-digit operating income growth for the full year. We feel very confident about being able to deliver that. And we have full line of sight, given we are actually in annual enrollment period for health care exchanges at the moment. And so that's really the level of guidance we've given so far.
Operator: Next question is Meyer Shields, KBW.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: This is, I think, a small numbers question. But I think, Greg, you mentioned that there were 2 points of carryforward of Reinsurance organic growth in the quarter, but no impact on the bottom line. I'm just trying to understand how that worked.
Gregory C. Case: Yes. Literally, it was just a match of timing in terms of expense versus revenue. So net-net for the year, Meyer, as we said, growth overall, low single digits as we sort of finish out the overall year, but no effect on the bottom line.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay, fantastic. With regard to the unfavorable HR revenue mix, is that driven by macroeconomic factors? I'm just wondering whether there's any way we can anticipate that ahead of time.
Christa Davies: It's really in our benefits administration risk business. And we've had pricing compression in that business for a number of years. It's been exactly as we expected. And that's really the main component of that.
Gregory C. Case: And as we said, Meyer, basically it begins to roll off 3 [ph], [indiscernible] more benefit, in '14, more benefit. I think the key theme, though, coming back to Christa's point, if you think about the business overall for the year, we're going to achieve what we hope to achieve, mid-single-digit operating income growth and then the ability to kind of invest strategically in a number of platforms, which we're funding as part of that, through the P&L.
Christa Davies: And the only other thing I'd add, Meyer, is clearly we are investing in high-growth areas like health care exchanges. And we've openly said that we are losing money in health care exchanges this year. And so if you think about it, you've got a high-growth area that's losing money, and so that contributes to a negative impact on your margins. But we feel really good about that business. We are incredibly well positioned. We have complete end-to-end solutions across the health care spectrum for clients and employees. And we feel like that investment will be our highest return on capital investment across the company.
Operator: Next question, Brian Meredith, UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple of questions here. First, Greg, I wonder if you could talk on the health care exchanges, how much of that 330,000 is actually in the retirement exchanges? Or is that a separate number?
Gregory C. Case: So Brian, the entire 330,000 is in the active exchange. As we've talked before, we're very pleased. As you think about sort of how we've developed that platform, last year, we had 3 clients. This year, we have 18, so 15 new, 1/2 of that group coming on are actually new names to Aon and Aon Hewitt. And in that context, it's 330,000 new employees and really 600,000 lives in total if you include dependents.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then how are the retirement exchanges doing?
Gregory C. Case: Retirement continues to progress very, very well. In fact, if you look across the spectrum, it's really as exactly as Christa described in the context of we've got a full range of solutions. We've got the most complete range of solutions. And whether you're talking across large corporate, middle market, small and retiree markets, it really is a broad set of solutions. And we've been very pleased with the understanding, adoption and now enrollment on both the active and the retiree side.
Operator: Next question is Adam Klauber of William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: A couple of follow-ups on the exchanges. How big of a barrier is it with the large group client to have an exchange with it hooked into your benefit admin and other technology components?
Gregory C. Case: It's not a barrier at all, Adam, quite the reverse, we think it's a big opportunity. When you think about what it means to bring together an exchange, you've got to be able to understand, design it, the brokerage that goes into it, administer it, and frankly, also risk control on the back end, when you think about what it means to pull together an integrated exchange. And I've just described the fundamental capabilities of Aon, Aon Corporation and Aon Hewitt. And that's really what's been a huge benefit for us is we actually brought what is a true set of innovative concepts to market. And for us, the exciting part has been the validation by very large corporate, sophisticated clients who know this space exceptionally well. We were very careful to make sure we were actually refining this, evaluating this across industries. We're very pleased to report a range of industries, clients that represent a range of industries came on board: retail, wholesale, professional services, hospitality, et cetera. So we would say from that standpoint, really the strength of the assets of Aon have really brought this together. Also remember, we already serve 6.5 million active employees on the benefits administration health side. That basis has been developed over many, many years. And the knowledge and understanding of that has served us exceptionally well as we've launched the exchanges.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Actually, you answered the question, but I meant the barriers for others to come in the business. But I think you answered the question.
Gregory C. Case: You'll have to be your own judge on that. We're going to focus on our clients and on Aon. But this is an exciting set of platforms that are coming onboard. But as you're really indicating, they really do require a lot of expertise and capability across a range of areas.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And one other follow-up on exchanges. As you were out talking with your clients this year compared to last year, what's the willingness -- what's the change in willingness of clients to listen to an exchange solution compared to a year ago?
Gregory C. Case: Well, you come back to the fundamental principle, this is truly about client need and what they're trying to accomplish. And our clients having -- facing a set of health care challenges and issues that just continue to increase, 8% to 9% growth year-over-year. If you look over the last 5 years, a 19% increase in pay versus an 82%, 83% increase in health care costs. So the willingness, if you've got a solution that really helps their employees, because that really is the focal point for our clients and our companies, that helps their employees understand, have greater transparency, have greater choice and really can start to think about ways they can modify their behavior and control their health care spend at the individual and company level, that's what's really created a set of opportunities for us. And it's been very, very positive. And as I said before, we've done, as we've introduced this to a very sophisticated set of clients and carriers, understand, we've got 20 carriers represented on our exchange, 11 new this year. So the uptick, to your specific question, was very strong early on. And then after we actually launched the first 3, as we did the first year, the interest was exponentially higher. And now having brought 18 new on, you can imagine the interest is also growing. And only because we've got a solution that actually helps them succeed. And that's what we're excited about.
Operator: The next question is from Mike Zaremski, Crédit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: In regards to pension contributions, I was curious, if we thought about today's higher interest rate levels and capital markets levels, would it be fair to say that pension contribution would likely fall when it's recalculated at year end?
Christa Davies: Yes, so if you look at Page 11 of the slide deck, we do have our estimated pension contributions for 2014 onwards. There obviously is sensitivity to those contributions based on market returns, interest rates and FX. And obviously, rising interest rates could be upside to those. But it's likely to be sort of still declining over time.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. So Christa, those are estimates as of 12/31/12, right. And so [indiscernible] estimate at the end of the year, they might change. Okay.
Christa Davies: Yes. And when we report Q4 earnings, we'll update these tables with the new measurement based on 12/31/2013, which is really the only official time we measure during the year.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, got it. Last question on the health care exchanges. Since my understanding for the actives, the offering, the platform you offer is on a fully insured basis, would that mean that fully insured employees -- employers are the main target, because self-insured employers have a higher kind of hurdle rate to convert, given the cost differentials?
Gregory C. Case: Not at all. In fact, what we really want to emphasize here, there's a lot of discussion out there using the word exchange, and they mean very, very different things to different people. So it's really important you parse it up and really understand the specific definitions. And when we said that we've got a full range of solutions, so we will cut across and actually focus on clients against their specific set of needs, what's exciting about the fully insured multi-carrier exchange is it does a number of things that just frankly don't exist in the market today. And we're associated with it because we have the only one that exists in the market today, fully insured, multiple carriers. And if you're talking to a currently self-insured large employer, which most of them are, so they've all actually made the decision, done the analysis themselves and decided the fully insured option was, in fact, the best option to help them succeed. And they saw opportunities to reduce their trend. They saw opportunities to [indiscernible] in cost, opportunities to reduce volatility. They saw something that actually created for their employee something that would be, create greater transparency, had a very clear view on options that they would have. And then the sophisticated employers also saw that they were creating greater alignment between the carriers and actually bringing their innovative solutions to help their employees change behavior. So you've really got a carrier now in the mix with their solutions to help employers become healthier, but they've really got a lot of emphasis and alignment behind that. So really, we've sat across the table from most of the larger companies that are self-insured, have done the analysis, looked at it, and that's actually where the greatest interest is. And as I said, we've got a full range of solutions. But this fully insured, multi-carrier solution is the only one of its kind today, and that's certainly created a lot of interest.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. I guess, along the same lines, are the actives versus the retiree platform, are the -- should we expect the economics to be similar?
Gregory C. Case: So what we said before, overall, the economics on both sides are going to be beneficial and they're going to continue to evolve. And as I said, if you step back, just go where Christa was at the beginning, think about we're going to be able to put this up, get it going, really build a platform in a very, we think, a significant high-growth area and deliver mid-single-digit operating performance in '13 and greater than mid-single in '14. So it's, we think, a very positive set of developments.
Operator: And next question is from Jay Gelb, Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: For the health exchanges, we've conducted an analysis of the potential upside from that market. And I just want to confirm a couple of our own assumptions. The commission rate on the private exchanges, what level is that come in at?
Christa Davies: Jay, we haven't disclosed that number, I'm sorry.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then pretax margins for health care exchange relative to the average for overall HR Solutions. I guess, if you're assuming faster operating earnings growth for the entire segment, that would imply at least the average level of margins.
Christa Davies: We actually think, Jay, at scale, the margins in this business are far more attractive than the average margins across our HR business, hence why we've invested so much in this area and why we believe it's one of the highest return areas across the company.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right, that's helpful. At what level would scale be achieved? Is that revenue? Is that insured lives?
Christa Davies: It's really about number of active participants in the exchange, because really what happens, Jay, is you have a cost of customer acquisition in year 1, and then you get improved margins in year 2 based on renewal. And then really, you have sort of some level of fixed investment on which you need to get a return, based on the number of employees. And we expect margin expansion and greater return on that investment in 2014.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. So what level of scale would you need to achieve on that number of active participants? It's around, what, 330,000 now of insured lives?
Christa Davies: We've got 330,000 active employees enrolled this year, which covers approximately 600,000, including dependents. And we feel like we're well on track to get scale.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then also separately, Christa, the pace of share buybacks picked up pretty significantly in 3Q, $500 million, that was largely consistent with what you did in the entire first half. So how should we think about the pace of buybacks going forward?
Christa Davies: I would say that buyback is a reflection in our confidence about the outlook for the company. As you know, Jay, we allocate cash based on the highest return on capital options across Aon, and share repurchase is the highest. As we look out over the next 5 years, we think that free cash flow could double over the next 5 years as we look at hitting our long-term margin target, decrease cash on pension and restructuring and decreasing the global tax rate. And so as we think about that, we're not giving specific guidance, but you can look at history as a guide.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right. But in terms of anchoring expectations, that $500 million for the quarter, that probably should not be viewed as a run rate. Is that right?
Christa Davies: I would not use it as a run rate, Jay. I would say as we get excess capital, we deploy it to the highest use of cash that we can find. And that's what happened this quarter.
Operator: Next question is Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Just a couple of cleanup questions here. One is could you talk a little bit about the businesses that were sold in the quarter, and maybe kind of add-on to that, sort of the strategic vision there in terms of what you're interested in selling and getting rid of?
Christa Davies: Yes. I mean, Paul, really primarily investments we had under long-term investments on our balance sheet. And you can see that number coming down over time. If you reflect back 2 years, that number was over $300 million. It's now closer to $100 million. And we're really just trying to sell off investments to receive the cash to actually put the cash to better work for shareholders.
Gregory C. Case: It really just reflects our focal point and our goal is risk and people. The clients understand, measure and mitigate risk and everything around people, pensions, retirement, health and benefits, talent and rewards. And this portfolio of investments, while have been on the books for a long time, isn't directly connected to that strategy. And therefore, in the appropriate times, we'll divest and invest that cash back into the business.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: What are those investments?
Christa Davies: Yes, I mean, they're really sort of long-term investments and percentage ownerships in things that have been on the book for a long time.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: No, I mean, I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't asking the question. I mean, how would you characterize those questions? Are they actually strategic investments in equities? Are they...
Christa Davies: No, they're definitely not strategic investments. Otherwise, we wouldn't be getting rid of them.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Well, venture capital, are they equities? Are they...
Gregory C. Case: Some examples, we made a number of acquisitions over the years. Some of those acquisitions comes with partial ownership of other companies that aren't on track at all. That's one example of one. And again, our evaluation was we had a $300 million portfolio that wasn't helping us succeed day-to-day in the risk and people mission of the firm. And we said when there's an appropriate time and an opportunity, we'll exit those investments and invest it back into the business. And it comes, as Christa said, from an entire range of things, different private equity holdings over time, again, subsidiaries of companies that we bought. And so we've just made a concerted effort, as we invest back into risk and people, to focus everything we can on that.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. That certainly squares with what you are doing. And then the tax benefit in the quarter, can we get a little bit more about that, just to see...
Christa Davies: So I would describe the Q3 tax rate as including discrete items. And so I think as we think about sort of the tax rate going forward, we're not giving guidance on tax rate going forward, we've said previously that we expect the tax rate over the long term to decrease by more than 500 basis points from the point at which we redomiciled the company to the U.K. And that's really the level of guidance we're giving.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: And the discrete items were...?
Christa Davies: Really just true-ups from our previous years' tax filings, certain regulatory changes, things like that.
Operator: Next question is Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I appreciate all -- you guys give great information. And thinking into the future, I'm sure you thought about 2017, when Obamacare will allow large employers to send their employees to public exchanges. Is that a competitive threat for the private exchange? And if it's not, why not?
Gregory C. Case: Again, we'd come back, Josh, to the fundamental principle, helping companies help their employees. And I really want to stress, to reflect on the conversations with the current companies that have decided to come onto our exchange, fundamental to their discussion was how do we help our employees. Because no one, I think, would describe the current health care system as efficient. And if you look across that system and say, how can it become more efficient, fundamentals of that is actually giving employees greater choice, but also providing incentives and accountability for them to change behavior and hopefully become healthier. And so this is really what the companies are focused on and this is really what our private exchange gives them. And the fully insured multi-carrier exchange for large corporate carriers or large companies, I should say, really provides that benefit and increases alignment in ways I've described before, that really puts insured -- the insurance carriers behind that mission. So it creates cost opportunity, as much as can be a cost advantage, but really, the companies are thinking about their employees and also the ability to help them make better decisions. So from our standpoint, we feel very good about that value proposition. I would also say the complication in all the different aspects that have to come together to make that viable and meaningful and compelling are quite substantial. So in our view, we hope the public exchanges succeed. We collectively need them to succeed. But for our companies and who we serve every day, obviously a different group, we feel very, very comfortable about our current value proposition. And as Christa has already described, we're investing very, very heavily behind it. So our level of innovation is going to be substantial over the coming years, so feel good about what that value proposition is going to look like today, and I suspect it will even feel better, what it looks like in 2017.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: When you have your strategic talks on exchange among yourselves, do you expect that while you'll keep most of your customers, there will be some customers lost to public exchange in 2017?
Gregory C. Case: Again, it's possible. But when we come back and you look at the fundamentals, there are 122 million active employees out there today. Those employers have literally said they're going to continue to really take on the responsibility of providing coverage. And a large portion of those are really going to be looking to exchanges. We see that actually grow over time. And really for us, the large employer has really been the focal point. And the set of solutions, they're going to make a choice on the best outcome, the best set of solutions, and we feel very good about the program we've got right now and the platform we pulled together. Again, you think about it, 18 companies really did the evaluation, very thorough, all the pros, all the cons, at the forefront of this opportunity and felt very comfortable and comfortable enough to bring their employees on it today. And these are very sophisticated companies, who've actually looked ahead and made all the tradeoffs that you're asking about. So we feel good about where we are. But we've got to keep innovating, investing and we've got to keep up and our companies help their clients succeed -- or their employees succeed, I should say.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great answer. And just one -- following on what Brian asked, on retiree versus active exchanges, one of your competitors is putting out very lofty successes they've had on the retiree exchange, but they haven't nearly met your successes on the active exchange. We haven't heard the same kind of success level on your retiree exchange as your active exchange. What's the timeline for that to be equivalently attractive? Or what do you think is going on there between those 2 types of products?
Gregory C. Case: Well, I would say, getting back on the corporate exchange, again, part of what's happening is the definition of exchanges are very, very widely varied. So I want to really emphasize that. And if you go back to kind of what an exchange means, we have really the only fully insured multi-carrier exchange at this point in time. So there are lots of other exchange options around self-insureds that will be talked about, but it just is kind of apples and oranges at this point from a value proposition. And on the retiree exchange, our Navigators group has done an exceptional job. We've got 46 clients now serving approximately 300,000 folks. And that will continue to grow and expand. And we're very excited about where we are, the platform we've got in place right now and how that's going to develop over time. It's just, as you said, the public, the media has picked up much more on the corporate exchange than the private exchange, and that's probably why you see a bit more about it.
Operator: The next question is Chuck Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I've got one question, Christa. Regarding the guidance and HR Solutions business, as of last quarter, there was 2 pieces of guidance. It was mid-single-digit organic growth or earnings growth and it was year-over-year margin improvement. And there wasn't any mention of the margin improvement story. Is this a change?
Christa Davies: No change.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So will be margin improvement year-over-year?
Christa Davies: Yes.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Excellent. I also have a question about CapEx and how you guys look at that. If the growth parameters that you're expecting change, is there any potential that there's more CapEx needed, that health care exchanges or the other technology platforms really take up, that you need further investment to manage that process or manage a growth track? And sort of what kind of variability there might be in that?
Christa Davies: So we've obviously given outlook for capital expenditure on Page 11 of the slide deck. And what I would say is we manage CapEx like we manage any other investment across the business. We manage it on a return on capital basis. We do have a capital-light business. And the capital we spend is primarily on sort of IT and investments in software. And obviously, we are making investments in data and analytics. And that does have CapEx related to it. And we expect that to continue. And so we will continue to evaluate our CapEx spend and invest as we get great return from it.
Operator: The next question is Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just had a couple of follow-up questions. One, just looking at the health care exchanges again. I guess, comparing the number of lives you see in the 330,000 on the active and then 300,000 on the retiree exchange this year, how does that compare to your expectations kind of heading into the enrollment season?
Gregory C. Case: We were -- it met our expectations. Again, when you think about it, this was not about numbers and volume for us, it's about quality and experience for employees. What we wanted to do in the first year, we brought 3 companies on, as you know, truly proved the concept of -- in this case, as a fully insured multi-carrier exchange. Went to renewal -- the second renewal of those 3 and then brought now 15 additional on. And our focal point was really beginning to scale up, which we've been able to do, but do it with the highest quality, seamless execution for our clients. And so for us, again, it's not about the number, because there's been tremendous interest and the pipeline is quite strong. It's about quality of experience, and that's been very, very positive.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then also, about the 15 new employees that you took on, how many other companies have you kind of started conversations with or spoke to about potentially joining your exchange?
Gregory C. Case: The pipeline has been quite substantial. And you can imagine, again, the interest out there now is quite high and the media has amplified it. And so we're having many, many conversations. And we're confident that we're going to continue to grow the exchange very robustly. And the interest, as I said, is quite high.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then also, when looking out, past commentary, you've kind of pointed to starting to have some positive earnings in 2014 and then growing even further into 2015. Is that still what you're thinking in terms of you'll see some positive contribution starting next year from the health care exchange?
Christa Davies: Elyse, what we think is, as you know, we are making a loss this year. We will improve performance in terms of profitability next year. And really, what you should look for is the HR Solutions operating income growth, which is mid-single-digits in '13 and greater than mid-single-digits in '14.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then one question, you guys announced an arrangement with Lloyd's earlier this year. And you, I know in the past, spoke positively about it from your point of view, and then also from your clients. Earlier this week, we saw Willis announce a kind of similar arrangement within the London market. If you could just update us of kind of what you're seeing with your own deal, and then also if you have any kind of views on what Willis has announced?.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, I'll just direct my comments to the work we've done and did with the joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway, is really what it was. And it was -- and it really was we just provided our clients with very fast, efficient access to AA+ capital, very, very positive. Our clients were very excited about it. We linked it to Lloyd's so that really was the capacity and the opportunities going into Lloyd's. And our clients have received it very, very well. And we said that before, and it hasn't changed, if you think about the placements into Lloyd's. And we are privileged, we're the largest provider into Lloyd's. And in that context, the clients that we engaged, so when you think about Lloyd's, 75%, 80%, 90% of them wanted to actually access this capacity, which is fantastic. And we said publicly, and Lloyd's has confirmed, that our volume into Lloyd's in the first part of the year through the first 9 months is up double digits. So I think, as we said, we thought the clients would be interested in it. We thought it would reinforce Lloyd's and reinforce their overall strategy, 2025 strategy. We think it's done that in the context of this. And they've actually confirmed that overall. I'll leave the Willis program to Willis on their call.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case: I just want to say thanks to everybody for joining, and look forward to the next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Gregory C. Case: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. And we note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is overall organic growth performance; and third, continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 4 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, driven by strong growth in Consulting and Retail Brokerage. Operating margin was essentially flat, as an increase in Risk Solutions margin was offset by a decline in HR Solutions and the unallocated section. EPS increased 9% to $1.11, reflecting effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow increased 20% driven by strong working capital performance. Overall, a solid performance against our key metrics as we strengthen our industry-leading platform for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3%, with growth across every major business. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage. With management of our renewal book through Client Promise, and retention rates of more than 90% on average, a record level of performance, highlighting strong client satisfaction in Retail Brokerage; new business generation of approximately $270 million across our Retail business, with double-digit new business growth in many markets globally across the Americas, Asia and Pacific regions; investments in new product and service capabilities, with the growth of GRIP and Aon Broking globally delivering increased operating leverage; and in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 9 consecutive quarters. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 5%. Exposures are relatively stable, the impact from pricing was modestly positive on average, reflecting a steady pace of increase over the last 12 months. We saw solid growth across all regions, including Latin America, U.S. Retail and Canada. In U.S. Retail, we delivered solid growth, driven by strong new business growth, including growth in property/casualty, Health and Benefits and Affinity, as well as strong management of renewal book portfolio with record levels of retention. In international, organic revenue growth was 3%. Exposures are relatively stable, and the impact from pricing was flat on average, with firmer pricing in cat-exposed regions and softer pricing in most regions across Europe. We saw strong growth in emerging markets, New Zealand and many regions across Asia, including double-digit growth in areas such as China, Philippines and Taiwan. In the U.K. and continental Europe, macroeconomic conditions remained fragile across many core markets. However, with leadership positions across this region, we saw solid new business growth, strong retention rates and management of our renewal book portfolio delivered modest growth. Overall, a solid performance against economic and market headwinds. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 2%. As we've noted over the last few quarters, record capacity continues to be available to meet demand. And cedents are retaining more risk, driving unfavorable market impact in the quarter. Absent an event in the industry, macro factors will continue to be a headwind in 2013. Against those headwinds, results reflect modest growth across all businesses. In treaty, as mentioned before, net new business won was positive for the ninth consecutive quarter. And we did deliver solid growth in our industry-leading capital markets transactions and advisory business. Overall, this level of performance and strength in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's unmatched level of investment and long-term value proposition for clients, while strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability. Turning to HR Solutions. Overall, organic revenue growth was 2%. We saw strong growth in Consulting Services despite weak discretionary spend globally and continued economic pressure in continental Europe. Underlying performance also reflects growth in areas where we're making significant investments in the business, in areas such as health care exchanges, investment consulting, pension and risk management consulting and HR BPO. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding the market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients, as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risks continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations, delivered at a local level; managing and transferring risk across pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. And finally, after continuing to work through the worst economic recession in the last 70 years, clients are beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development and engagement to prepare themselves for renewed long-term growth. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. Underlying results reflect solid growth across our retirement businesses, for investment consulting, and pension administrative services, as well as communications consulting. Despite weak demand for discretionary services and overall economic weakness in continental Europe, for the full year, we continue to expect low- to mid-single-digit organic growth across the Consulting Services business. In Outsourcing, organic revenue was flat. Organic growth reflects net new client wins and demand for HR BPO, health care exchanges and discretionary services, partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration. As we noted last quarter, we continue to make great progress in our health care exchanges and interest in the Aon Hewitt corporate exchange continues to be particularly strong. In Q2, we had excellent sales, which will drive strong growth in enrollments for 2014. And the client base represents a broad range of both new logos and existing clients across a broad range of industries. If you think about the corporate exchange, the progress of the team has been truly an outstanding accomplishment. We went from concept in 2011 to active enrollment of the industry's only active multi-carrier corporate exchange for large employers. Enrollment of roughly 100,000 employees plus eligible dependents. All participating clients are referenceable, with representation from both existing clients and new logos. Great progress from the team in serving existing clients on the exchange and building the pipeline, reflecting the strength of our industry-leading platform across employee benefits design, brokerage and administration. Slide 5 highlights the third topic, areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include: in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the Revenue Engine internationally, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates. We continue to invest in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information. We now have roughly 1.7 million trades, more than $88 billion of bound premium and a growing list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and service capabilities. In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. A great example of this, among many, is our structured portfolio solutions effort in Health and Benefits. Another example is the continued alignment of our global Health and Benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities. Further, we have substantial investment in the development of data and analytics capabilities at Aon Benfield to strengthen an already industry-leading client-serving capability. Finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients, as well as adding key talent across Asia in specialty sectors and in our GRIP solutions business. In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position in health care exchanges. Health care exchanges enable clients to begin transitioning their participants to a market-based, defined contribution model for health care that gives participants more choice while addressing unsustainable health care cost increases and decreasing population health. As a growing leader in the private health care exchange market for post-65 retirees and the leader in the private exchange market for active employees, we're focused on driving greater scale in 2013 and improved returns in 2014. We're expanding in high-growth areas for our current clients and new markets. Innovative solutions to de-risk pension plans are in high demand with our existing retirement client base. Our delegated pension solutions are opening relationships in new markets. And finally, we're providing a broader set of advisory and advocacy solutions to our clients' employees to better enable greater choice and improve decision-making on their retirement and health care options. We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology platforms, including extensive mobile solutions. And finally, we're strengthening our international footprint to support a global workforce with investments in key talent and capabilities across Asia and emerging markets. Overall, we proved the concept of these major investments in 2012, and we're fully on track to deliver greater scale and increased operating leverage in 2013 and 2014. In summary, we delivered organic revenue growth across both Risk and HR Solutions, continued to ramp up significant strategic investments that will drive greater long-term growth and operating leverage, delivered solid earnings and strong double-digit free cash flow growth. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, we continue to position Aon for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility. Our performance in the quarter reflects continued progress against our key financial metrics, with solid earnings and 20% free cash flow growth, highlighted by the repurchase of $225 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter, on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 9% to $1.11 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.02 in the prior year quarter. Results reflect the strong performance in our Risk Solutions segment, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management in the quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include: noncash intangible asset amortization, redomicile costs primarily for legal and advisory fees to complete the transaction; and restructuring charges related to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program. We expect that all remaining charges for the formal restructuring programs will be complete and final in 2013. Foreign currency translation had a $0.02 unfavorable impact on EPS in the quarter due primarily to a stronger dollar versus the Aussie dollar and Japanese yen. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a similar impact in both the third and fourth quarters. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 60 basis points to 22.5%, and operating income increased 5% versus the prior year quarter. Organic growth, including benefits from our investments in GRIP and Aon Broking, as well as $6 million of estimated restructuring savings, were partially offset by a minus 20 basis-point unfavorable impact from a decline in investment income and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. Under the Aon Hewitt program, approximately $90 million of estimated savings will be achieved in the Risk Solutions segment, primarily related to workforce and lease consolidation within the Health and Benefits business that was transferred in 2012. Approximately $51 million of the $90 million in cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, with approximately $39 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. A breakout of restructuring charges incurred in Risk Solutions, associated with the Aon Hewitt program, is detailed in the schedules on Page 13 of the press release. Overall in the second quarter, we delivered solid operating performance in Risk Solutions despite continued economic uncertainty in Europe, an unfavorable impact from foreign currency and a decline in investment income. For the first 6 months, Risk Solutions margins were up 90 basis points, placing us firmly on track for margin improvement for the full year and continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%. Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 2%, operating margin decreased minus 50 basis points to 14.9%, and operating income was essentially flat to the prior year quarter, in line with expectations we provided at the beginning of 2013. Overall, modest growth and $15 million of incremental restructuring savings were offset by investments in long-term growth opportunities and an unfavorable revenue mix shift. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, approximately $288 million of estimated savings will be achieved in HR Solutions, primarily relating to workforce and lease consolidations. Approximately $227 million of the $288 million in cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, with the remaining $61 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. Incremental savings opportunities were identified as we completed the final analysis of the Aon Hewitt program. These savings will: number one, overcome the onetime impacts in the first quarter; number two, optimize our significant investments in long-term growth opportunities such as health care exchanges and investment consulting; and number three, strengthen our outlook for higher operating income growth in 2014. As discussed in the previous quarter, we provided commentary regarding the outlook for the HR segment in 2013 and that outlook is unchanged as results continue to be in line with expectations. We expect to: number one, deliver continued organic growth; number two, drive greater scale and improve return from the investments; number three, deliver savings related to the restructuring program; number four, deliver performance modestly down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, resulting in mid-single-digit operating income growth and margin expansion for the year. Now let me discuss a few other line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $44 million, including certain expenses related to the company's redomicile. Interest income was similar at $2 million. Interest expense decreased $9 million due to a decline in both the average rate and the total amount of debt outstanding in the quarter. Other income of $6 million includes a net gain due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and net gains related to long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense and $55 million per quarter of interest expense. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 26.4% in the second quarter. The company currently expects that its full year effective tax rate for 2013 will be approximately 26%. But the tax rate for 2013 may change depending on discrete tax adjustments and the geographic distribution of income. The company currently expects that over time, the reduction in its effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations will be greater than previously anticipated. The actual effective tax rate in any particular period will depend on discrete tax adjustments and changes in the geographic distribution of income. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 317.1 million in the second quarter compared to 335.6 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased 3.5 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $225 million in the second quarter. The company has $3.5 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30 were 307.5 million, and there are approximately 9 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q3 2013 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 316.5 million, subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $573 million, and total debt outstanding was $4.4 billion. Overall debt-to-capital was 37% at June 30 compared to 37.6% at March 31. The decrease is primarily driven by a reduction in total debt outstanding. Cash flow from operations increased 17% or $49 million to $333 million in the second quarter, due primarily to improved working capital and a $43.5 million favorable impact from the settlement of a non-recurring onetime legal matter, partially offset by a $41 million increase in cash taxes. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 20% or $45 million to $271 million in the second quarter, driven by improved cash flow from operations. Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. As you can see from this chart, based on current assumptions, we expect free cash flow to increase by over $500 million over the next 6 years, based only on a reduction in cash used in pensions and restructuring. Growth in the core business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate would generate additional free cash flow growth. Regarding our underfunded pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continued to do de-risk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by $85 million to $463 million in 2014, and continue to decline thereafter. Regarding our restructuring plans. Cash payments are anticipated to be $158 million in 2013. As our restructuring plans continue to wind down, we expect cash payments to decline by $83 million to approximately $75 million in 2014, before declining further each year thereafter. As we continue to grow, improve operating performance and our required uses of cash decline, we expect our strong free cash flow growth to continue to be a significant source of value creation for shareholders. In summary, we delivered solid earnings and strong free cash flow growth, and are firmly on track to deliver improved performance in 2013. While we're investing to further strengthen our industry-leading portfolio, we're focused on 3 primary areas that will each contribute to substantially stronger free cash flow over the next several years: first, continued growth and operating margin improvement towards our long-term targets; second, declining uses of cash, primarily for pensions and restructuring; third, greater capital flexibility and increased cash flow from a lower effective tax rate. Combined with a strong balance sheet and increased financial flexibility, we've positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Adam Klauber of William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: It sounds like you're getting good momentum on the company, health care exchanges. I realize selling season probably isn't over yet, but could you guys, I guess, give us some idea, if you had 2 clients last year, how many clients or what the range of potential clients you could have this year? And if you had 100,000 lives -- just any ranges would be helpful.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, I'm happy to do that, Adam. As you would expect, we're going to always protect our clients and this will come out over time and be clearer over time. But this has just been, for us, an extraordinary selling season. We've been very excited about it. We had 3 clients, by the way, last year, at 100,000-plus lives, recognizing one was Aon but 2 others, Sears and Darton, our public information earn-on, went exceptionally well and I feel very good about it. This year, we're going to have a significant number of new clients, very significant, multiples of new participants, new logos. You're also going to see a real mix across industries, as well, as we were going forward looking at. And also, more carriers who are now participating in the overall exchange. So for us, it's just really been a very positive enrollment cycle this time. And we have a pipeline that's actually even more substantial for the coming year. So the investment, from our standpoint, it has really picked up and we're quite excited about it. And the last thing I would just say on this, it's really the employee experience that's really driving this. As we've tracked and watched how employees have engaged in the exchange over the last cycle, it's really been a powerful tool to talk to future companies about -- thinking about this because not only are they able to actually control costs more effectively now and manage their health care cost situation more effectively, they're also able to provide an enhanced experience for their employee, which is obviously quite important as well. So you'll see this evolve over the coming months, but it's just been an exceptionally strong cycle for us and we're quite excited about this.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, great to hear. On -- with the employer mandate being pushed off, did that push off some of the decisions of potential clients?
Gregory C. Case: It really hasn't had that much impact. Overall, if anything, it raises the specter and clients want more insight and advice in terms of, sort of, how to deal with the evolving health care world. As we've said before, the Affordable Care Act, fundamentally, doesn't address employee health and it doesn't address unit cost of health care. And what the exchanges do is give companies the chance to sort of, at least, get a handle on how to think about that more effectively for their company. And so for us, it hasn't had a huge impact. And as I've said before, it had just been a very robust season and we expect it to continue in the next season as well.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And just finally on the topic, you signed a joint venture with eHealth, if I understand that correctly, to help with potentially temporary or lower paid employees and also, potentially, early retirees. Do you think that, that joint venture will have visibility at the end of this year? Or is that more of a long-term-type venture?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, it's going to come in over the long term. But it's just another example of -- one of the things we want to try to do is really try to communicate the opportunities on how to think about this very important choice at the company level and at the employee level, and eHealth helps us do that. And it's a great solution for clients but also for individuals as they think about trying to evaluate a very complex space.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple of questions. First, a quick one here. Christa, just curious, why will interest expense go back up since you reduced your debt?
Christa Davies: Yes, there was a onetime item in the quarter and it's also just the timing of our debt in terms of when we brought the new debt on, which happened during the quarter. And so as you sort of, when you get to run rate numbers, it will increase.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then, Greg, I wonder if you could talk about what you think the impact right now on organic revenue growth is from the weak European economy? Let's assume we can go back to some kind of a normalized 3% nominal GDP, how would that impact organic growth in the international, as well as the HR Solutions business?
Gregory C. Case: Well, as you -- firstly, you saw, Brian, in the end, I want to emphasize that it is uneven, it has been a challenge. But it really is -- Europe was really -- not Europe but, say, a series of individual countries with individual situations. And we've got very positive, we've got very strong franchises in each of those. As you saw, we had 3% growth on the Retail side in Europe, outside international this quarter as well. And roughly kind of 20% of our revenues, overall, if you think about it, there's obviously upside as the economy strengthens over time. But we've been able to actually weather the storm quite well, and we anticipate, continuing to be able to do it, to the extent it exists and continues. At its core, clients need what we're providing. They need to understand how to measure and mitigate risks. They need to understand how to deal with these important issues around their people on retention -- or on retirements, pensions and health care. So all these issues remain fundamental, and for us, it's -- we believe we've got real growth opportunities that are both domestically and around the globe.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Right. But you did say in your opening comments that the weaker economy is actually having an issue on organic growth?
Gregory C. Case: You're absolutely right, and it is. And as you know from us before, we're not going to use that as an excuse. We're going to grow organically irrespective of that. In terms of that, to the extent they become any kind of a tailwind -- and we haven't seen it in a while, obviously, adds substantial positive economic impact on us. But in the meantime, clients have needs, we're going to address them, and we're going to grow organically irrespective of the economic situation.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Right. Just quickly, lastly, could you break out your comments or give a little more detail on the health care exchanges and kind of break it out between how the retirement exchange is going versus the corporate exchange?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, both have actually progressed well. The retirement exchange navigators have been in place a little bit longer. Strong programs, series of investments there, really love the platform and really getting strong reception from companies around the world. The newer one, Brian, on the corporate exchange, the first-ever multi-carrier fully insured exchange with 3 companies last cycle. Now we have many, many this cycle, as I've said before. Both going very, very well. And again, we are -- we love the value proposition for companies and for their individual employees. We think it's going to have a lot of power going forward. And we just want to be able to build it in a very incremental, straightforward way that let's us really build a sustainable business long term. And this year has really been a great step forward in that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: And this is a simplistic question. But if all of your traditional health care clients renewed on the exchanges instead of the older systems, can you talk generally about what the impact would be on revenues and margins?
Christa Davies: They would both improve.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, second, this is completely unrelated, the capital expenditures that you provided seems to be increasing about 5% a year. I was just hoping you could talk us through where that number comes from?
Christa Davies: Yes, I mean, the largest area for capital expenditures for us is IT. And if you think about our business, we're increasingly differentiating through data and analytics. Whether that's GRIP on the Retail Brokerage side, it's the incredible series of data and analytics we have in Aon Benfield, where we spend over $100 million a year or it's health care exchanges or pension de-risking or investment consulting. So there's significant investments in data and analytics across all of our businesses. And it's a little bit less than organic growth, is the way we think about CapEx growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A couple of questions. On the corporate health care exchanges, you mentioned there were some new carriers that you put on the platform. Have any of the major carriers decided to leave the platform because of their experience in 2013?
Gregory C. Case: We didn't have anybody exit, and we added multiple, as I said before, Jay. No one exited.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Second question, you had mentioned the benefits administration revenues were feeling some pressure. If you could go into more detail on what's happening in that business?
Gregory C. Case: Just as you think about sort of the overall business, it's a competitive business and as it continues to evolve, we've experienced some price compression historically. We continue to do that, although that's mitigated quite a bit of late. And that's been a headwind for us as we face 2013 and we think about 2014, offset by the investments we're making to grow in other areas. And that's going to mitigate that over time, but that's been a headwind.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Mostly pricing pressure, then?
Gregory C. Case: Well, it's pricing, but it's also -- kind of terms conditions, things you're doing, servicing, et cetera, and sort of the common apply [ph]. But overall, it's been a headwind. It's something we're mitigating against and it's, as I said, it has decreased, but it's been a meaningful headwind, which is why I wanted to call it out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill Partners.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: A couple of questions, not related, but the first one should be easy. You mentioned that you thought that the tax rate would be lower than expected. Is that purely a function of the geographic location of where you think earnings will be, and that's changed over time? Or is there something else there?
Christa Davies: It is exactly that, Paul. It's related to improved visibility around the geographic distribution of income and discrete tax adjustments.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: So simply, more earnings in lower-taxed countries?
Christa Davies: That's right.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: And then, I wanted to ask, sort of, more of a philosophical question on the property/casualty brokerage side and get your perspective on it. I'm curious about whether or not -- there's a lot of conversation here about pricing and whether or not we're seeing a deceleration in the hard market, at least, in North America. And I was wondering if you think that the traditional linkages between Reinsurance and E&S and some other lines that tend to lead the cycle, have changed if we have more of a de-linkage between those types of markets, or if we should be paying a lot of attention to what could happen to primary because of what's going on with Reinsurance?
Gregory C. Case: Paul, as we said before, I alluded to it in my comments at the beginning, we look very factually on kind of what's happening on the Retail side in pricing, against what is our GRIP platform, $80 billion of premium. So we're -- this is not concept, this is literally looking exactly what Aon has done and has in place. And there hasn't been that much change since the prior quarter, up slightly but stabilizing. As you highlight on the Reinsurance side, more pressure and it's coming from clients increasing the amount of retention that they keep and also, pressure from outside sources of capital. We see that continuing and absent some significant event, will be a headwind on the Reinsurance side. And that's just how we see it, it will evolve over time. And we're obviously quite active in both marketplaces. But generally, the story on pricing hasn't changed much since the first quarter, it's really continued at the same trends into the second quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Crédit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question, HR Solutions segments, I noticed there was some commentary in the slide deck about unfavorable revenue mix shift. Could you elaborate because I thought Consulting was the higher-margin contributor within the segment? And I guess, related as well, Consulting organic growth picked up, and I was just curious if you think Aon is taking share there or growing at the market's organic pace?
Christa Davies: Yes. So in terms of the unfavorable revenue mix shift, it's really about getting revenue growth in areas in which we are investing. And so if you think about the areas in which we're investing, we're investing in BPO through the partnership with OmniPoint. We're investing in health care exchanges, and those are lower-margin businesses right now, which we expect to get to a much higher margin over time. But what you're seeing is substantial revenue growth in lower-margin businesses, hence, the unfavorable revenue mix shift. And then, I think Greg is going to take the second part of your question.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, on the point on share, the way we think about the overall market now, we've got a set of platforms that are unique. And we're investing behind those in ways that are actually have never been done before. So we're investing more in content capability on the risk side, both Retail and in Reinsurance. And we're doing the same, obviously, on the Hewitt side in Consulting and in Outsourcing. And we think this gives us a very strong platform to develop clients. You're seeing it in new business generation in Risk, you're seeing it, as well, on the Consulting side now, as you raised. So it's, for us, it's not about just taking share, it's winning for clients everyday, it's doing a very systematic, thoughtful approach. It's creating new demand, as well, helping clients understand issues they might not have seen before and help them to address those productively. So for us, we want to just keep investing behind value propositions that are understandable and valued by clients, things that they will pay for. That will benefit our shareholders, as well as our clients. And doing it in a systematic, thoughtful way. And that's what you're seeing evolve, really, across the businesses, on the Risk side and on the Consulting side.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay got it. Lastly, in terms of our leverage levels, I see the debt-to-cap up a couple of points quarter-over-quarter. I was curious if you can refresh us on how Aon thinks about its leverage tolerance levels? And I believe the rating agencies might also be a factor and they make a number of adjustments when calculating their own ratings.
Christa Davies: Yes. So debt-to-capital was actually down slightly. It's 37% at the end of Q2, whereas, it was 37.6% at the end of Q1. And that's really just because debt came down slightly during the quarter. As we think about overall leverage levels, we definitely look at the amount of our unfunded pension liability and leases, to your point on how the credit rating agencies look at this. And we're very comfortable with our leverage levels as they are today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I want to talk a little bit about Lloyd's. And maybe it's just coincidental this quarter, but there's some chatter out there that there's some syndicates who are your clients who were disappointed with the quarter share range with Berkshire, and might not want to use Aon Re as their broker next year. And I noticed that Reinsurance volumes, obviously, are a little bit soft than they were a year ago. I'm wondering if it's related and if you have a response to that rumor in the market?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, we haven't seen that, Josh, at all. In fact, if you step back, as we said before, we've seen now 9 consecutive quarters of net new business growth on the Reinsurance side and really strong, across the board, in traditional, as well as on the cat bond side for many of these clients. So we've seen very, very positive from that standpoint. And I would just say on the transaction you're referring to, pleased with the overall progress, seen positive results for clients. They've shown interest in really 75% to 90% of the situations depending on the line of business. Interestingly enough, by the way, for the -- basically 1 of 3 orders, both existing and new clients, have increased their share in the London market or Lloyd's as a result of this overall joint venture. So it's actually been positive from that standpoint. And I would say quite the contrary to what you're, I think, it sounds like you're picking up -- Steve McGill and team have had very positive conversations with the senior leadership of Lloyd's and many of the syndicates around, frankly, how we can continue to work together to strengthen the value proposition for clients. Because in the end, that's really what this is all about, how do we help clients succeed. And in that regard, I think it will actually be a catalyst to help Lloyd's really meet their Vision 2025 mission, which is a very aspirational set of objectives for Lloyd's overall. So from our standpoint, we see good progress here.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And do you think there's a positive outcome for Reinsurance-buying clients?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, absolutely. In the end -- by the way, these Reinsurance-buying clients are also the primary clients as well in terms of what we're doing. And overall, we're strengthening relationships across Lloyd's, as well as, which is really the 87 syndicates within Lloyd's.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: All right. And looking at -- maybe I can get some scale here, of course, Consulting, up very strong, 6%; Outsourcing revenue is flat. And it's interesting because in the commentary, you talked about doing well on -- in discretionary services, but -- and the health care exchange, but offset by benefits. So when I think about the size of contribution from each of those areas, HR BPO and health care quite small and benefits quite large. I know we talked about the health care exchange is a large part of the story here, but it's suggested it would be a number of years before it was a meaningful contributor to results. Can you sort of parse the size of the opportunity now versus maybe 3 years from now to help us understand where it is in terms of the arsenal of what Aon has to offer in the future?
Gregory C. Case: Well, basically if you think about the overall portfolio of investments that we're making, they're not only in health care exchanges, they're in some real wheelhouses in the investment side of the business and the Retirement side of the business, on investment consulting and other areas. So there's a whole range, there's a whole portfolio of areas that we've invested heavily in that are impacting performance. In 2013, the exchanges, as we said before, are going to be more like 14 and 15 from a bottom line standpoint, closer to 15 but they're certainly going to impact top line overall. And we feel very good about the progress on these investments. And net-net, I would come back to where Christa was, which is if you think about what we committed to as we can here, mid-single-digit growth. And by the way, absorbing all of the investments we described before on the health care exchanges and the investment side, we feel very good about achieving that exact commitment, mid-single-digit growth, and stronger in 2014. So that's the progress.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And when you think about benefits administration -- I'm asking about benefits administration persisting, would that be a drag on that outlook?
Gregory C. Case: No, it doesn't change the outlook at all, we're essentially absorbing the outlook. All we want to do is, as we always do, fully transparent, call out sort of the puts and takes. Ben admin has been a headwind. It's diminished, it's mitigating but it's been a headwind, offset by other areas of the business, and by the way, fully absorbing across the business all the investments we're making too. So we are absolutely where we started the year, which is a mid-single-digit growth, and that's what we're going to -- that's where we're going to end up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just wanted to follow up on the HR segment. You mentioned in the last response, several times, mid-single-digit growth is where you're confident. And you did show a surge in profitability in the division last year. So there's -- what I'm wrestling with is, because of the decline in op income in the first half, it's a big bogey for the back half and yet, you're obviously very confident. Where is that confidence coming from? Is this because -- I mean, what do you see that we can't? And is it expense management, is it compensation, is it other expenses, is it accelerating organic? Because it implies a very big back half on the profitability line.
Christa Davies: We patterned the year that way from the beginning, and the guidance we originally gave in Q4 2012 was that we were going to deliver performance modestly down in the first half and up in the second half, resulting in mid-single-digit operating income growth and a margin expansion for the year. One of the things that's driving the patterning much more towards Q4 for us is health care exchanges, where revenue recognition means that when you place the policy, which really happens all in Q4, you recognize the revenue entirely in Q4. And so we do have sort of revenue patterning and therefore, profitability patterning of that investment towards Q4. We also have savings flowing through throughout the year, and that continued to improve during the course of the year. And we have improvement in our core performance. So as Greg described, we do have some headwinds in benefits administration, which impacted more the first half than the second half. And so that's improving during the course of the year. They're really sort of the 3 big things that leads to patterning in the second half. And all of those things will also lead to improved performance in 2014.
Gregory C. Case: But that line of sight that Christa just described was the exact line of sight we described Q4 last year for the year, and that's exactly what's progressed through the first half of this year.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: My only -- I guess, my pushback is that the Outsourcing division, the organics coming out of the Outsourcing are just not -- I mean, you might have been sitting in the fourth quarter thinking they'd be a bit better than they are right now. So I mean, I believe you, it sounds like you guys are going to hit the guidance. It's just it seems like the revenue isn't coming in like you might've thought 6 months ago or am I wrong? Is it actually coming in exactly where you thought on the organic line when you first...
Christa Davies: It is, actually, it's coming in exactly as we thought and I think one of the things we have with our Outsourcing business is very long contract terms. And it allows us to get very good visibility to revenue and therefore, profitability.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then last, just on this. It looks to me like the math, unless the organic just is going to come in incredibly bigger, just raw dollars, you're going to spend less dollars year-over-year in the back half 2013 than you did in 2012. Is that correct? In this division?
Christa Davies: It's that you get a return on the investments and in particular, the revenue shows up in the fourth quarter. And so you could describe it as less expenses, you could also describe it as the revenue or the return of that investment shows up, particularly in health care exchanges, that's really the phenomenon that's occurring. And yes, we're getting reduced expenses through savings improving, so there is some of that going on as well.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And my apologies, last on this, it sounds like then, Christa, the fourth quarter is when we're going to get the biggest bang in the margins. Third quarter should be better and then, fourth quarter is really where we're going to see, as we're modeling, is that how we should be doing it?
Christa Davies: That's exactly right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: One question, Greg, if you could, on the capital coming into the Reinsurance market, can you talk a little bit about the fees that you're generating from those types of placements? And kind of what the growth has been like from a structuring perspective as you guys engage in those activities? And then, and I'm also just curious, generally, what are the fees to you, to Aon, look like on a -- from a traditional reinsurer versus one of these structures? And then, just lastly, another carrier mentioned that they were seeing a lot of growth in the traditional market from sort of pent-up wins. And then, but the capital markets were there and opportunities were potentially coming, but that was not a big net change for them so far. I'm just curious if I could get your thoughts on those things?
Gregory C. Case: Well, I'll try to answer this and we can come back if I'm missing anything. Back up Aon Benfield, roughly 85% treaty overall, 10% fac, about 5% on the investment banking or the capital market side that you were describing before. And we really -- while you can break it out in these categories, what we're really looking at is how do we help clients improve their capital efficiency? How do we actually help them think about improving return on invested capital and driving value from the standpoint of improved operating performance, a stronger balance sheet or reducing their volatility. That really is the fundamental sort of thesis behind what we do, and we actually bring a range of solutions in each of these categories to actually help clients do that. And in the context of doing that, you can imagine, if you can sit across the table from a client, look them in the eye and tell them you can increase their return on invested capital, the remuneration to Aon Benfield takes care of itself. And that's really, fundamentally, how we built the business. And it turns out, we are in the #1 position in each one of these categories: #1 in treaty, #1 in fac and #1 in capital markets. And just from the standpoint of just the, sort of, the insurance length securities piece, this is something we've been involved in for a long time. Everyone talks about kind of data and analytics and it's kind of the nouveau for most people, it's not for Aon Benfield. We've been doing this for 10 years. We invest over $120 million a year, hard dollars and content capability. And ILS is an example, it's something that's -- we focus on and we do very, very well. If you think about all the transactions since 2010, we've been involved in about almost 50% of them, 47% of them. So 29 transactions, that's 10 more transactions than #2 or #3, who happen to be investment banks. If you think about year-to-date, in 2013, I think we've done 9 deals, which probably it's half of the deals. So this is something that we're very, very involved in. It's still a modest part of overall business, but something that's very, very important in sort of what we do. And we don't think necessarily about the economics one-off. We think about it for a client, when you think about the treaty complement, the ILS complement and the fac complement, how do we improve return on invested capital for them. So for us, it really is a broad-based complement and a suite of capabilities being brought to the table with the horsepower of data and analytics that is very unique in the industry today. So I know that it didn't answer exactly what you asked, but I really want you to understand, philosophically, how we think about the business and why we see the opportunity here so positive over time.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Does a growing, sort of, alternative capital base coming in make your position -- do you think it makes your position more relevant as, kind of, a market leader in that market?
Gregory C. Case: Well, again, we've got the strongest platform of anyone in the world in that category already, and philosophically, what we're essentially saying is, to our clients, "Hey, there are other sources of capital that can actually help you improve your efficiency on your balance sheet." And so we're in an excellent position -- I would argue, the best position, to sort of help clients continue to take advantage of other sources of capital to help them improve their business. So for us, this is not about a diminished opportunity or an increased opportunity, it's about a changing opportunity that we're in a very good position to take advantage of on behalf of our clients.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then, Christa, if I could really quickly -- it looked like there are some changes to the restructuring math in that last slide of the presentation before the appendix. It looks like restructuring spend, a little bit higher and then, but when I did the math on the -- increase is about 90-ish million, but the increase in total operating cash over cumulative operating cash was just about $7 million. So I was just trying to square those two?
Christa Davies: Yes. So we have increased savings by $100 million through the end of 2014. We've increased the total cost by -- and actually, I think what you're seeing is just the timing of the actual cash payout that's changed slightly. So you've seen the cash payout increase slightly in 2013, and it's flowing through future years as well.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Because when I just -- and maybe this is wrong, I just added up all of the restructuring cash and that was about $100 million -- $90 million more through 2018. But the change in the cash -- the incoming cash, the free cash flow cumulative went from $513 million to $506 million -- I'm not exactly sure what it was but I was just trying to -- I would think that more spending would lead to the more savings down the road.
Christa Davies: Yes. So this is just -- the cash is just a charge, and the savings are showing up in the P&L. So it's actually sort of slightly -- so you're seeing the restructuring cash is really related to the charge or the expense, and it's not netting the savings here on Page 11.
Operator: Our last question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Two questions. One, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the organic growth in the Brokerage or the Risk services segment. How much is coming from rate versus how much is coming from new client activity?
Gregory C. Case: So we've said before, overall, rates had a modestly positive impact across our overall book, very low-single digits, very low. And roughly the same story as we had in the first quarter, so it's a very modest impact. And substantial impact, as we said before, on the retention, renewal and new business. I mean, the retention rates we've been able to achieve are truly -- they've been extraordinary, record highs and the team's done an exceptionally strong job there, as well as new business generation, with $270 million in new business across the firm in this quarter. Just a very strong performance, up substantially from the same quarter last year. That's really been the driver.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I know you don't disclose specifically, but how does conceptually Aon GRIP and Broking playing into that new business? And any kind of color on how does that affect that business and just towards of opening doors or anything else?
Gregory C. Case: Well, at the end of the day, what we've essentially said is, what we're trying to do with Aon Broking -- GRIP fits into that context, is essentially, it's really about yield on per dollar of premium placed across the system. So as we think about sort of the -- each dollar that we're able to place, what is our remuneration against that. And Aon Broking, in particular, helps us sort of understand the yield across the book and do things that, by the way, help strengthen the value proposition for clients. And in doing so, we get increased yield. That really is the story of GRIP as well, which is really helping carriers match capital with client need very, very effectively around world. And so in essence, that -- when you put all that together, that actually increases yield per dollar of premium placed. So that, really, is how it shows up in the P&L.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Christa, one follow-up, I think, for you on a balance sheet question. When I'm thinking about the CapEx spend, and you guys been -- you have a couple, maybe $200 million of CapEx or at least a decent portion of your CapEx going into IT spend. Where is that showing up on the balance sheet? Because if I look at intangible assets, it sort of seems that it's amortizing off and sort of the listed $99 million of intangible amortization, but I don't see -- I would expect it, I guess, to be going up as you're, in turn, reinvesting in IT.
Christa Davies: Yes, it's showing up in the balance sheet in other assets.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. So all the new investment shows up in other assets, then?
Christa Davies: Right, pretty much.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case: I just want to say to everyone, thank you very much for participating, and we look forward to the discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995 (sic) [Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995]. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.
Gregory C. Case: Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2013 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. And we note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is overall organic growth performance; and third is continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 4 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 3. In the first quarter, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, driven by strong growth in Retail Brokerage. Operating margin was essentially flat, as a significant increase in Risk Solutions margin was offset by a decline in HR Solutions and the unallocated section. EPS increased 13% to $1.11, reflecting both solid operating performance and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow increased $80 million in our seasonally weakest quarter, driven by strong working capital performance. Overall, a solid start to the year as we strengthen our industry-leading platform for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter, with growth across every major business. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates more than 90% on average, our record level of performance, highlighting strong client satisfaction in Retail Brokerage; new business generation of approximately $240 million across our Retail business, with double-digit new business growth in many markets globally across the Americas, Asia and Pacific regions; investments in new product and service capabilities, with the rollout of GRIP and Aon Broking globally; and in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 8 consecutive quarters. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. Exposures are relatively stable, and the impact from pricing was modestly positive on average, reflecting a steady pace of change over the last 12 months. We saw solid growth across all regions, including Latin America, U.S. Retail and Canada. In U.S. Retail, we delivered solid growth, driven by double-digit new business growth, including growth in property/casualty, health and benefits, construction and Affinity, as well as strong management of the renewal book portfolio with improved retention and rollover rates. In international, organic revenue growth increased 3% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. Exposures are relatively stable, and the impact from pricing was flat on average, with firmer pricing in cat-exposed regions and softer pricing in most regions across Europe. We saw strong growth in emerging markets, New Zealand and many markets across Asia, including double-digit growth in areas such as Korea, Philippines and Singapore. In the U.K. and continental Europe, macroeconomic conditions remained fragile across many core markets. However, with leadership positions across this region, we saw strong retention rates, and management of our renewal book portfolio delivered modest growth. Overall, a solid performance against economic and market headwinds. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 5% in the prior year quarter. As we noted last quarter, record capacity continues to be available to meet demand, and cedents are retaining more risk, driving an unfavorable market impact in the quarter. Results reflect growth in our capital markets advisory and transaction business, as well as facultative placements. In treaty, as mentioned before, net new business won was positive for the eighth consecutive quarter. Overall, this level of performance and strength in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's value proposition for clients, while strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability. Finally, we would observe that absent an event in the industry, macro factors will continue to be a headwind in 2013. Turning to HR Solutions. Overall, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. We saw modest organic growth across both Consulting and Outsourcing despite weak discretionary spend globally and continued economic pressure in continental Europe. Underlying performance also reflects growth in areas where we're making significant investments in the business, in areas such as healthcare exchanges, investment consulting, pension and risk management consulting and HR BPO. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients as healthcare reform, healthcare costs and the associated financial risk continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for a global benefit solution that supports their global organizations delivered at the local level, managing and transferring risk across pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. And finally, after continuing to work through the worst economic recession in the last 70 years, clients are just beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development and engagement to prepare themselves for renewed long-term growth. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. Underlying results reflect growth in communications consulting and strong demand across our retirement businesses, for investment consulting, pension administration services and talent rewards. And despite continued pressure on discretionary services and overall economic weakness in continental Europe, for the full year, we continue to expect low- to mid-single-digit organic growth across the Consulting Services business. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. Organic growth reflects net new client wins and demand for HR BPO, healthcare exchanges and discretionary services, partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration. As we noted last quarter, we continue to make progress in our healthcare exchanges, and the pipeline for growth during the fourth quarter of 2013 enrollment period continues to grow. If you think about the corporate exchange, the progress of the team has been a truly outstanding accomplishment, from concept in 2011 to launch last quarter of the industry's only active corporate exchange; enrollment of roughly 100,000 employees plus eligible dependents; and all participating clients are referenceable, with representation for both existing and new clients on the exchange. Great progress from the team in healthcare exchange area, reflecting the strength of our industry-leading platform across employee benefits design, brokerage and administration. Slide 5 highlights the third topic, areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include, in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency, with the rollout of the Revenue Engine internationally, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates. We continue to invest in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information. We now have roughly 1.6 million trades, more than $83 billion of bound premium and a growing client list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and service capabilities. In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. A great example of this is a sidecar facility agreement we announced with Berkshire Hathaway, providing clients efficient access to AA+-rated capacity for eligible business placed by Aon Risk Solutions. Clients are expressing considerable interest in this facility, especially in traditionally capacity-challenged sectors, as a way to augment capacity for products within those sectors. We're also investing in continued alignment of our global Health and Benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities. And we continue substantial investment in further development of data and analytics capabilities at Aon Benfield to strengthen already industry-leading client servicing capability. And finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capacity to better serve clients, as well as adding key talent across Asia in specialty sectors and in our GRIP solutions business. In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position in healthcare exchanges, both in retiree and active markets. Healthcare exchanges enable clients to begin the shift of their participants to a market-based, defined contribution model for healthcare while addressing unsustainable healthcare cost increases and decreasing population health. While already a growing leader in the retiree market, we launched the industry's first and only fully insured, multi-carrier corporate exchange in Q4 and will be focused on driving greater scale in 2013 and improved returns in 2014. We're also expanding in high-growth areas for both current clients and new markets. Innovative solutions to de-risk pension plans are in high demand with our existing retirement client base. And our delegated pension solutions are opening relationships in new markets. We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology platforms, including extensive mobile solutions. And finally, we're strengthening our international footprint to support a global workforce with investments in key talent capabilities across Asia and emerging markets. Overall, we've proved the concept for these major investments in 2012, and we're on plan to drive greater scale and increased operating leverage in 2013. In summary, we delivered organic revenue growth across both Risk and HR Solutions, continued to ramp up significant strategic investments that will drive greater long-term growth and operating leverage, delivered double-digit earnings and strong free cash flow growth. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our performance reflects a solid start to the year with double-digit earnings growth. We continue to position Aon for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility, as highlighted by the repurchase of $300 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter, as highlighted on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 13% to $1.11 per share for the first quarter compared to $0.98 in the prior year quarter. Results reflect the strong performance in our Risk Solutions segment, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management in the quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 13 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and redomicile costs primarily for legal and advisory fees to complete the transaction. Foreign currency translation had a $0.02 favorable impact on EPS in the quarter. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no material translation impact to EPS in the second quarter of 2013. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 22.5%, and operating income increased 9% versus the prior year quarter. Organic growth, restructuring savings and a 40-basis-point favorable impact from foreign currency translation more than offset a minus 20-basis-point unfavorable impact from a significant decline in investment income due to lower short-term interest rates globally. Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs' key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. Associated with the transfer of the Health and Benefits business at Jan 1, 2012, an estimated $52 million of restructuring savings under the Aon Hewitt program will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $45 million of the $52 million in cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, including an estimated $5 million of incremental savings in the first quarter. A breakout of restructuring charges incurred in Risk Solutions associated with the Aon Hewitt program is detailed in the schedules on Page 14 of the press release. In the first quarter, we delivered strong operating performance in Risk Solutions despite continued economic uncertainty in Europe and an unfavorable impact from decline in investment income, placing us firmly on track for margin improvement for the full year and continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%. Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 1%, operating margin decreased 220 basis points to 14.3%, and operating income decreased 13% compared to the prior year quarter. An unfavorable impact from legacy litigation and the timing of certain expenses of $10 million or minus 100 basis points, continued investment in long-term growth opportunities and an unfavorable revenue mix shift more than offset organic revenue and incremental restructuring savings in the quarter. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $26 million of charges in the quarter. Cumulative savings related to the formal restructuring program in the first quarter are estimated at $69 million compared to $48 million in the prior year quarter, of which approximately $5 million of the incremental savings were achieved in the Risk segment. Excluding the $10 million of legacy litigation and the timing of certain expenses that negatively impacted the quarter, our results are exactly in line with expectations and guidance previously provided for the HR Solutions business. As we noted in the previous quarter, we provided commentary regarding the outlook for the HR segment in 2013, and that outlook is unchanged. We expect to, number one, deliver continued organic growth; number two, drive greater scale from the investments made in 2012; number three, deliver additional savings related to the restructuring program; number four, deliver performance down in the first half and up in the second half, resulting in mid-single-digit operating income growth and margin expansion for the year. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $41 million, including certain expenses related to the company's redomicile to the U.K. Interest income decreased $2 million to $1 million due to lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances; interest expense decreased $7 million to $52 million due to a decline in the average rate and the total amount of debt outstanding during the quarter; other income of $9 million includes a net gain due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and net gains related to certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $55 million of interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations decreased to 26.1% in the first quarter compared to 28% in the prior year quarter, due primarily to changes in geographic distribution of income. We currently anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 26% in 2013. Minority interest was $11 million, similar to the prior year quarter. Based on performance, we expect minority interest to be approximately $11 million per quarter going forward. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to $320 million -- sorry, 320 million in the first quarter compared to 336.6 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to our share repurchase program. The company repurchased 5 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $300 million in the first quarter and has approximately $3.7 billion of remaining authorization. Actual shares outstanding on March 31 was 309 million, and there are approximately 10 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2013 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 319 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At March 31, cash and short-term investments was $760 million, and total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion. Overall, debt-to-capital was 37.6% at March 31 compared to 34.9% at December 31. The increase is primarily driven by the timing for certain long-term debt placements between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. Cash flow from operations increased by $69 million to $54 million in the first quarter compared to a use of $15 million in the prior year quarter. The first quarter is historically our seasonally weakest quarter from a cash flow perspective, due primarily to incentive compensation payouts. Significantly improved working capital performance more than offset a $106 million increase in cash taxes and a 40 -- sorry, an $86 million increase in cash contributions to the major pension plans in the first quarter. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 93% or $80 million, reflecting a significant increase in cash flow from operations and an $11 million decline in CapEx. Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. As you can see from this chart, based on current assumptions, we expect free cash flow to increase by over $500 million over the next 5 years, simply due to a reduction in cash used in pensions and restructuring. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline $90 million to $548 million in 2013 and continue to decline thereafter. Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were $143 million in 2012. As our restructuring plans continue to wind down, we would expect cash payments to decline $26 million to approximately $117 million in 2013 before declining further each year thereafter. As we continue to grow, improve operating performance and our required uses of cash decline, we expect our strong free cash flow to continue to be a significant source of value creation for shareholders. In 2012, we took significant steps to unlock that value for shareholders by increasing our strategic position and financial flexibility with the redomicile to the U.K. The company completed its change of jurisdiction of incorporation on April 2, 2012, and we believe the transaction will help drive shareholder value through, number one, greater global access to expected increases in future free cash flow; number two, an increase in future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term, more than what we've done over the last 5 years, which was approximately 500 basis points; number three, enabled us to access $300 million of excess capital held internationally on our balance sheet during 2012. In summary, we delivered double-digit earnings and strong free cash flow growth and are firmly on track to deliver improved performance in 2013. While we're investing to further strengthen our industry-leading portfolio, we're focused on 3 primary areas that will each contribute to substantially stronger free cash flow over the next several years: first, continued growth and operating margin improvement towards our long-term targets; second, declining uses of cash, primarily for pension and restructuring; third, greater capital flexibility and increased cash flow from a lower effective tax rate resulting from our redomicile to the U.K. Combined with a strong balance sheet and increased financial flexibility, we have positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Adam Klauber, William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: In the Consulting segment, it sounded like Europe was somewhat weak. What was the growth in the -- just the U.S.?
Gregory C. Case: We don't talk overall, Adam, sort of a specific region, but as we would describe is, net-net, expectations for the year continue to be exactly where they were as we left off last year, kind of low mid-single digits across the board for the year. U.S. was stronger than Europe for obvious reasons when you think about discretionary spend and how clients are reacting under the current situations they're in. But the underlying programs we've put in place to build client retention and obtain new clients, strong in the U.S., strong in Europe, and obviously, the headwinds are a bit stronger in Europe than the U.S.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then as far as the healthcare exchange, you mentioned that the pipeline for new potential clients is looking good. After you signed up several large clients at the end of the year, did that really raise perception, I guess, number one? And number two, as we think about the year-end 2013 enrollment season, any -- I know you can't set a number on it, but is it possible to sign up materially more clients than you did at the end of 2012?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, if you step back and think about the exchanges overall, remember we've got a retiree exchange. Navigators has actually been in place and is working very, very well with a pipeline that's growing. You're referring to the corporate exchange, and you're exactly right. We were the first to put a multi-carrier exchange in place and actually bring it live. And we brought it live with clients in the last renewal period. And as you just described, having done that successfully, all those clients are referenceable, very positive reaction. As you might expect with a proven concept, that has tremendous benefits for companies and even for employees over time, you're getting a lot more demand in the context than we saw last year. Exactly what we expected. Let's say, from our standpoint, what we want to do is continue to grow and build out that -- the exchanges on the corporate side. The team's done a terrific job in doing that. We've got a very robust pipeline going into this renewal season, and we expect to continue to see that grow and see the return from that investment. So from our standpoint, it's going exactly as we had expected, with probably even a little more robust demand than we thought. And certainly, as you look at the competitive environment, you're seeing a lot of other folks think about this space as well.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And one final question on HR Solutions margin. Clearly, first quarter is a slower seasonal quarter and you had some expenses. Without putting a number on it, do you think the margin goes up from 1Q from here?
Christa Davies: Yes, we do. What we would say is it's going to improve sequentially each quarter during the year. And as we gave guidance, we still think we're exactly on track for mid-single-digit operating improvements for 2013, down in the first half and up in the second half. And due to the seasonality you described, you're exactly right, that Q4 will be seasonally higher than it has been historically, primarily due to healthcare exchanges.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Brian Meredith, UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple quick questions here for you. First, Christa, on the guidance in the HR Solutions business for income for the year, did that include the $10 million of litigation, or should we strip that out when we're thinking about growth for the year?
Christa Davies: No, it's exactly in line with what we said at the end of Q4, Brian, so we do think we're going to get the $10 million back.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So you'll get the $10 million back also. Okay, great. Second question, Greg, more for you. On this Berkshire deal that you all did. I guess the question I have there is, what has the Lloyd's market kind of reaction been from your perspective? And is there any risk, kind of from a revenue perspective, perhaps Reinsurance or something, where some of the Lloyd's syndicates may not be too happy about it?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, Brian, as we've looked at this, this really is a client solution, first and foremost. It's a client solution, as we've described it, that brings AA+ rated capacity into the market in a way it's never been brought into the market before. I would also say, as I know you know, RIMS is just concluding now on the West Coast, and the client reaction from the announcement has actually been quite positive. If you think about it, if you're a client in an area of constrained capital, this is now another area of capacity that just wasn't there before. As we've described, so it's truly a focus on kind of client need and client benefit. As we've also talked with Lloyd's about is, currently is linked to Lloyd's. So it really, we think, will actually provide some positive momentum into the Lloyd's marketplace overall, and we're going to continue to discuss it with them. Lloyd's is, obviously, a very important partner, and we're going to continue to work with our partners to serve our clients. But at its coal face [ph], this is truly a client-focused effort, and it's beginning to play out exactly like that.
Operator: Next question is Meyer Shields, KBW.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Greg, you've mentioned the client interest in the acceptance of the Berkshire deal. Is there going to be any negative impact on Reinsurance revenues from, let's say, other Lloyd's participants that feel like they're getting squeezed out?
Gregory C. Case: Well, listen, again, back to -- here, our focus really is on the client-serving capability of this. And by the way, Lloyd's is also a very client service-focused partner as well in the context of what we do. So from our standpoint, we see this as a net positive overall. We're obviously in active conversations, as we are with Lloyd's. We're roughly 22%, 23% of Lloyd's business overall, so I think probably the single largest partner with Lloyd's. So it's a very, very important partner. But in the context of that, we think this initiative is going to be very -- it has already been extremely client-friendly and beneficial. And in that context, it really reflects the strength of our data and analytics and our approach to the overall market that we can bring to bear on behalf of clients that others haven't been able to do. So that's how we've looked at it, that's how it's playing out, and we're going to keep focused on client benefit.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay, I understand. And Christa, you mentioned that unallocated expenses were high in the quarter because of the redomicile. Is that a run rate, or this just a set of expenses associated with the move that should wind down pretty quickly?
Christa Davies: No, it is going to be run rate, so we've now reforecasted the unallocated expenses to be $45 million a quarter going forward.
Operator: Next question is Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A couple questions. The first is, the organic growth in the HR Solutions business really fell pretty significantly from the fourth quarter, which may have been overstated. And I'm wondering if -- what the change was between the fourth quarter and the first quarter.
Gregory C. Case: So Jay, as we -- if you step back and think about the year overall, don't overplay in any single quarter too much, our view is exactly as we left off in the fourth quarter of last year. And really, it's true for top line and bottom line. We think it's going to be mid-single digits for the year across -- from a growth standpoint, both in the Consulting side and in the Outsourcing side. We saw a little more pressure than expected in the first quarter. There are -- there's a couple things that were timing, a couple things that were sort of client discretionary pressure in Europe, as we described before. But the takeaway we want you to have from this call is that we really expect low-single digits for the year overall, and that's fully online. And as Christa described as well, we expect the same on the operating income growth side too, low-single digits.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then on the timing, so when you have a timing issue, you're losing revenue either from future quarters, so it will come in future quarters, or you earned it earlier. How does the timing work here? Is this stuff that will come in later in the year that you didn't see in the first quarter?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, it's a little bit of stuff that will come in later, as we described before, but it's also a little bit more on the seasonality side as we've pushed on the healthcare exchanges, and those are going to be more of a fourth quarter event than they are a first quarter event. But net-net, as we look at the years, as I said, we expect low single-digit growth on the top line, both on the Consulting side and the Outsourcing side, and that hasn't changed at all.
Operator: Next question is Greg Locraft, Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just again to sit on the European slowdown and the impact in HR. If I go back to my notes in the second quarter of last year, you all mentioned that the first quarter is seasonally the most important quarter for Europe. What I'm wondering is, is was that commentary based on the overall corporation, was it an HR Solutions comment, or was it a risk management comment?
Gregory C. Case: No, the -- as you think about the patterning of revenue across Aon, this is really what you're describing is truly focused on Risk and not on HR Solutions. So if you think about our Risk business overall, the first quarter is very important from a European standpoint. The fourth quarter is very important from an Americas and a U.S. Retail standpoint. So that's how the Risk business plays out. So that commentary was directly focused on Risk and not HR Solutions.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Perfect. And then, I guess, just a follow-up then. The organic and the international division of Risk, actually, was fine. I'm assuming Europe is sitting in there. And so therefore, there's no slowdown there. You sort of hit it seasonally well. I'm sort of scratching my head as to why the miss out of Europe in HR Solutions, but I'm also appreciating that maybe it wasn't a miss relative to what you guys thought you were going to do this year anyway because the guidance remains the same.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, and if -- you're exactly right. If you parse the two, stay on risk for a second, 3%, we feel good about across international, always like it to be stronger. International also includes Asia and Pacific. Those are particularly strong. I want to be clear, there is real headwind in Europe. Our colleagues are doing a great job fighting through that with very, very strong positions we have in the marketplace, managing the renewal book. So there's real pressure there. There's certainly less pricing benefit, if any, in that theater. So there's real pressure there, and our colleagues have done a good job sort of overcoming that to kind of get to the 3% outcome. And as I said before, certainly, positively impacted by Asia and Pacific. And then as we've said on HR Solutions, we are exactly as we expect to be for the year, mid-single-digit growth across the board on Consulting and Outsourcing. A little more pressure than we thought in the first quarter, but it'll play out the same over time.
Operator: Next question is Mike Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Greg, could you talk a little bit more about the trends that you're seeing in the domestic risk book and, in particular, kind of on the renewals side? What do you think is contributing other than some exclusive actions you're taking? What is contributing to the fact that renewals are -- the profile of the renewal book is improving? And I have just one follow-up.
Gregory C. Case: So this really starts back to the investments we've made over a period of time, which we're rolling out globally, started in the U.S. and are now rolling out around the world. And as we have talked over the last number of quarters, we've invested heavily to put those in place. By the way, in the context of doing that, it's cost us some margin. And as those have come to fruition, we feel like we're going to get operating leverage, and that's really what you're starting to see. And that shows up in areas like Client Promise that we've rolled out, and the Revenue Engine, also areas as we've rolled out GRIP in the U.S. and now around the world. So these are fundamental investments that we believe are strengthening the business and strengthening our ability to both bring new clients in but also improve the value proposition to existing clients. And in doing so, you're going to increase retention and increase rollover. And that's really what we're seeing in the U.S. and we anticipate seeing around the world.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Can you tell me just in terms of like your relationship with clients, and we've had a couple years of rate gains here, are you able to secure better rates for your clients than the market overall? And is that a factor as people become a little bit -- maybe a little bit more bristled about further rate gains? Is that a relevant dynamic?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, what I would say is, so against -- we're not going to speak to specific competitors. But Aon is fundamentally built and has made what we believe to be unprecedented investment in content and capability that enable us to actually understand the market, measure risk and then bring the market to bear on behalf of our clients, respectfully, better than anyone else in the world. That's really the focus of the firm. You think about Aon Benfield. Aon Benfield spends in excess of $120 million a year on content and capability to help clients understand how to understand, measure risk, reduce risk, change volatility, reduce volatility. And in that regard, these are truly industry-leading investments. The purpose of these investments is to help drive better value for clients, and that shows up in multiple ways, terms, conditions, price, et cetera. And the same is true on the Retail side when you think about what we've done with the Global Risk Insight Platform. The Risk Insight platform, literally, is the single biggest database of risk information in the world. And as we mine that on behalf of our clients and better match carrier capital to client needs, we believe they benefit substantially. And if clients understand value, they'll pay for value. And that's what we're starting to see.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And just one follow-up, if I could, for Christa. I was trying to understand just the math on HR operating income. Let me know if this is wrong, but I think with kind of low-single-digit growth on the organic side, it would seem like you would need a couple hundred basis points of improvement year-over-year in the back half of the year to hit that mid-single-digit operating income increase year-over-year. Is that right or -- and if so, is that kind of what you're expecting?
Christa Davies: Yes, we are. And what we would say is, as we think about the year, we originally gave guidance to say that we would be down in the first half and up in the second half. We still believe that's right. And in terms of operating income patterning, it's really essentially down in Q1, essentially flat in Q2 and 3 and up in Q4. And the up in Q4 is substantial, as you described, really driven by seasonality, healthcare exchanges and restructuring savings.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. So it's further back-loaded. So it's not really not back half, it's really fourth quarter?
Christa Davies: Yes, it's mostly fourth quarter, that's right. Really primarily driven by the seasonality, because the healthcare exchange investment and the revenue from healthcare exchange is really just showing up in Q4, makes Q4 sort of much more seasonally acute than it's previously been.
Operator: Last question is Mike Zaremski, Crédit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Christa, could you update us on the client invoicing issue that took place last year and whether we should still expect a $350 million benefit to free cash flow this year? And I had a follow-up.
Christa Davies: Yes, we do expect to receive that benefit this year. We are continuing to make progress every quarter. And so we feel good about that progress.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And in regards to the Aon Hewitt restructuring plan, the 2012 10-K cites expected personnel reductions of 2,000. I noticed that number was up from 1,500 to 1,800 in the prior guidance or 10-K. So should the increased reduction result in eventual -- eventually, additional cost saves?
Christa Davies: Look, as we continue to implement the plans, we continue to update the numbers. And you see the numbers move slightly, as we update the most accurate numbers in the press release, as you can see, and we'll have them in the Q this quarter. Overall, we are on track to receive the $355 million of savings. So exactly where they come from does shift slightly between workforce reduction and leases on a quarterly basis as we complete the activities.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case: Thanks. I want to thank everybody for being part of the call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Aon and look forward to the conversation next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc. You may begin.
Gregory C. Case: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. And we note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow, along with our commentary today. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. And third is continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share. Additionally, beginning this quarter and going forward, we'll add free cash flow to our key metrics, given its fundamental importance to the value of the firm and how we think about value creation for shareholders. Turning to Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 4% overall, driven by solid growth across all businesses in both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions. Operating margin was flat overall. An increase in HR Solutions margin was offset by certain nonrecurring items of both risk and the unallocated section. EPS increased 9% to $1.27, reflecting both solid operating performance and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow increased 243% to $484 million, driven by strong working capital performance. If we turn to the full year, organic revenue growth was 4% overall, a continued rate of improved organic revenue growth from 2% in 2011, flat in 2010 and minus 1% in 2009. Operating margin declined 40 basis points, driven predominantly by an increased level of investment spend in the first half of 2012. EPS increased 4% to $4.21. And finally, free cash flow increased 48% to $1.2 billion, driven by a record $1.4 billion cash flow from operations, a truly incredible effort from the team. Overall, both a solid finish to a challenging year and a year of substantial progress to strengthen our industry-leading platform for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 4 on the second topic of growth. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior-year quarter, with growth across every major business. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction. New business generation of more than $300 million across our Retail business, with record new business in U.S. Retail and double-digit new business growth in many markets globally across the Asia and Pacific regions. Investments in new products and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP and Aon Broking globally. And in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 7 consecutive quarters. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth increased 4% compared to 3% in the prior-year quarter. Exposures are relatively stable, and the impact from pricing was modestly positive on average, reflecting the steady pace of change over the last 12 months. We saw solid growth across all regions, including Latin America, U.S. Retail and Canada. In U.S. Retail, we delivered solid growth, driven by a record level of new business, including growth in property/casualty, Health and Benefits, construction and M&A. A really tremendous effort across the team given significant disruptions from Superstorm Sandy in Q4, supporting clients and dealing with personal tragedy all at the same time. In International, organic revenue growth increased 2% compared to 1% in the prior-year quarter. Exposures are relatively stable, and the impact from pricing was flat on average, with firmer pricing in cat-exposed regions and softer pricing in regions across Europe. We saw strong growth in emerging markets, in New Zealand and in many regions across Asia, including double-digit growth in areas such as India, China and Taiwan. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, macroeconomic conditions remained fragile across many core markets. However, with leadership positions across this region, we saw strong retention rates and management of our renewal book portfolio delivered modest growth. Overall, a solid performance against economic and market headwinds. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 4% in the prior-year quarter. The results reflect strong growth in our treaty business globally, overcoming an anticipated decline given the challenging prior-year comparable quarter in the capital markets transactions and advisory business. In treaty, as mentioned before, net new business won was positive for the seventh consecutive quarter, and results benefited from favorable market pricing impact in the near term, primarily due to losses incurred in the prior year from property cat-exposed regions. Overall, this level of performance and strength in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's value proposition for clients of strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability. As we noted last quarter, record capacity continues to be available to meet demand and cedents are retaining more risk. Absent any events in the industry, macro factors may return as a headwind, as we will have to overcome in 2013. Turning to HR Solutions. Overall organic revenue growth improved to 6% compared to 4% in the prior-year quarter. We saw the rate of organic growth improve across both Consulting and Outsourcing despite weak discretionary spend globally and continued economic pressure in Continental Europe. Performance also reflects growth in areas where we're making significant investments in the business, in areas such as health care exchanges, investment consulting, pension risk management consulting and HR BPO. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients, as health care reform, health care costs and associated financial risk continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations delivered at the local level, managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. And finally, after continuing to work through the worst economic recession in the last 70 years, clients are just beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development, engagement to prepare themselves for renewed long-term growth. Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic growth was 8% compared to 3% in the prior-year quarter. Results reflect strong demand across our Retirement business for investment consulting and pension administration services, including growth from certain nonrecurring product-related work, primarily to help clients to think about derisking defined benefit plans. We also saw strong growth in talent rewards, primarily for compensation benchmarking. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth improved to 6% compared to 4% in the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth in health care exchanges and in HR BPO from new client wins, partially offset by a decline in benefits administration. Growth in health care exchanges was driven by renewals in our retiree exchange and the official launch of our corporate health care exchange, in which the majority of the revenue related to the active participants is recognized in the fourth quarter from a normal enrollment cycle. If you think about the corporate exchange, the progress of the team has been a truly outstanding accomplishment. From concept in 2011 to launch in Q4 of the industry's only active corporate exchange, enrollment of roughly 100,000 employees, plus eligible dependents. All participating clients are referenceable, with representation from both existing and new clients on the exchange for Aon. It's really great progress on the team in the health care exchange area, reflecting the strength of our industry-leading platform across employee benefits design, brokerage and administration. Slide 5 highlights the third topic, areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include: In HR Solutions, as mentioned before, we're making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position in health care exchanges, both in the retiree and active markets. Health care exchanges enable clients to begin the shift of their participants to a market-based, defined contribution model for health care, while addressing unsustainable health care cost increases and decreasing population health. While already a leader in the retiree market, we launched the industry's first and only fully insured multi-carrier corporate exchange in Q4. And we'll be focused on driving greater scale in 2013 and improve returns in 2014. We're expanding our Outsourcing offerings in high-growth areas, such as financial advisory services for retirement plan participants. We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology platform. And we're developing new delegated solutions in investment consulting and pension risk management that leverage our total capabilities across advisory and delivery services. A great example in this area was our recent advisory work for a large client around pension settlement and derisking activities, which led to one of the largest insured annuity settlement transactions in U.S. history. Finally, we're strengthening our international footprint to support a global workforce with investments in key talent capabilities across Asia and the emerging markets. In Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the Revenue Engine internationally, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates. We continue to invest in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information. We now have roughly 1.5 million trades and more than $80 billion of bound premium and a growing list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and service capabilities. In addition, we're driving and delivering our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. In 2012, we aligned our global Health and Benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities. And finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients, as well as adding key talent across Asia in specialty sectors and in our GRIP services business. Overall, we proved the concept through these major investments in 2012, and as we move across 2013, we're on plan to deliver greater scale and increased operating leverage. In summary, we delivered an improved rate of organic revenue growth across both Risk and HR Solutions, made substantial and significant strategic investments that will drive greater long-term growth, delivered record cash flow and took important steps to strengthen our global firm, highlighted by the re-domicile from Chicago to the U.K. completed earlier this year. With key members of the management team now fully relocated to London and as a U.K. headquarter multinational group, we're seeing increased interaction with international and emerging market clients, reinforcing our relationships with London markets, increasing our international brand awareness, driving the financial benefits related to the transaction and appreciating the opportunities to strengthen our relationship with the U.K. government. And with that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our performance reflects solid organic revenue growth, significant investments to strengthen our platform, strong free cash flow and effective allocation of capital, as highlighted by the repurchase of $500 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. I would note, this is more share repurchase than we've done in any quarter since 2008 and is both the reflection of our belief in the underlying value of the firm and the record cash flow from operations we delivered in 2012. Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter as highlighted on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 9% to $1.27 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.16 in the prior-year quarter. Results reflect improved organic growth across both segments, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management in the quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in schedules on Page 13 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and re-domicile costs, primarily for legal and advisory fees. Foreign currency exchange rates have no material impact on earnings per share in the quarter from a translation standpoint. If currency would have remained stable at today's rates, we would expect no material translation impact to EPS in the first quarter of 2013. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin was flat at 23.2%, and operating income increased 2% versus the prior-year quarter. Included in operating income was an unfavorable impact from nonrecurring items and a $7 million or a 30 basis point decline in investment income from lower short-term interest rates, globally. Organic revenue growth and a modest benefit from restructuring savings in the quarter were primarily offset by these 2 items. Let me spend a moment on formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding investments and long-term structural margin expansion. The Aon Benfield's restructuring program is now complete. Savings in the fourth quarter are estimated at $36 million compared to $33 million in the prior-year quarter. The Aon Benfield program delivered cumulative expense savings of $146 million in 2012 compared to $122 million in 2011. Associated with the transfer of the Health and Benefits business at January 1, 2012, an estimated $52 million of restructuring savings under the Aon Hewitt program will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $40 million of the $52 million in cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, including an estimated $7 million of incremental savings in the fourth quarter. A breakout of restructuring charges incurred in Risk Solutions associated with the Aon Hewitt program is detailed in the schedules on Page 14 of the press release. In 2012, we strengthened the Risk Solutions platform with significant investments in GRIP and key talents, managed through continued economic uncertainty in Europe and absorbed an unfavorable impact from both investment income and foreign currency translation. Against these challenges, Risk Solutions margin increased 10 basis points to 21.7%, and operating income increased 2%, placing us on track for a stronger performance in 2013. Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 6%. Operating margin increased 50 basis points to 17%, and operating income increased 11% compared to the prior-year quarter. Strong organic revenue and $17 million of incremental restructuring savings more than offset our significant investments in long-term growth initiatives and an unfavorable revenue mix shift. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $41 million of charges in the quarter. Cumulative savings related to the formal restructuring program in the fourth quarter are estimated at $67 million compared to $43 million in the prior-year quarter, of which, approximately $7 million of the incremental savings were achieved in the Risk segment. While we are always cautious not to overplay the results of 1 quarter, our results reflect a solid performance. For the full year, we are primarily on track with the plans that we laid out at the beginning of 2012, which included: number one, improved organic growth in both businesses; number two, investments in new growth opportunities; number three, savings delivered related to the restructuring program; and number four, performance that would improve in the second half of the year. As we think about full year 2013, we expect to: number one, deliver continued organic growth; number two, drive greater scale from the investments we made in 2012; number three, deliver additional savings related to the restructuring program; number four, deliver performance modestly down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, resulting in mid-single-digit operating income growth and margin expansion for the year. Our guidance is a reflection of the seasonality of our business being weighted more towards the second half, similar to 2012. This is due to revenue recognition from health care exchanges in Q4, the timing of cost savings initiatives plus investments in the business. This is not a change in our long-term outlook and continues to reflect the path we laid out at the beginning of 2012 for improved operational performance in 2013. Turning to the next slide, on our long-term operating margin targets. We continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve operating performance on an annual basis. While we've improved operating margins 510 basis points over the last 7 years, our long-term operating margin target of 26% for Risk Solutions reflects significant opportunity for further margin expansion in the following 5 ways: number one, deliver $16 million of remaining restructuring savings and other operational improvements; number two, continued rollout of Revenue Engine internationally; number three, Aon Broking and GRIP-related initiatives. These 3 are fully within our control. In addition, there are 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant operating leverage based on improvements in the external markets: number four, increases in short-term interest rates; number five, industry improvements, driving higher insured values or insurance pricing. Similarly, for HR Solutions, while we've improved operating margins over 1,000 basis points over the last 7 years, our long-term operating margin target of 22% reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 3 ways: number one, deliver $32 million of remaining restructuring savings after the transfer of savings for Health and Benefits; number two, growth in the core business and return on incremental investments, including health care exchanges; number three, improvements in HR BPO. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on the next slide. Unallocated expenses were $48 million, including $3 million of nonrecurring costs related to the debt exchange offer completed in December and certain expenses related to the re-domicile. Interest income was flat at $4 million. Interest expense decreased $4 million to $55 million due to a decline in the average rate and the total debt -- amount of debt outstanding in the quarter. Other income had no impact in the quarter. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million per quarter of interest income, $40 million of unallocated expense and $57 million of interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations decreased to 25.2% in the fourth quarter compared to 27% in the prior-year quarter. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 was favorably impacted by certain discrete tax adjustments. We currently anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 26% in 2013. Minority interest was $2 million, roughly similar to $3 million in the prior-year quarter. With consolidation of one of our major joint ventures in Asia into consolidated results, we would now expect minority interest to be approximately $7 million per quarter going forward. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 327.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to 337.9 million in the prior-year quarter, due primarily to our share repurchase program. The company repurchased 8.9 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter and has approximately $4 billion of remaining authorization. Actual shares outstanding on December 31 were 310.9 million, and there are approximately 11.5 million of additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 2013 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 322.4 million. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At December 31, cash and short-term investments were $637 million and total debt outstanding was $4.2 billion. Cash and short-term investments declined due to the use of excess capital held internationally on the balance sheet. Overall debt-to-capital was 34.9% at December 31 compared to 34.6% at September 30. As Greg mentioned, we've added free cash flow as our fourth key metric to measure performance each year, given its fundamental importance to both the value of the firm and how we think about value creation for shareholders. Cash flow from operations increased 139% to $552 million in the fourth quarter compared to $231 million in the prior-year quarter. Cash flow from operations for 2012 increased 39% to a record $1.4 billion compared to 1.1 -- sorry, $1 billion in 2011. Improved working capital performance more than offset cash contributions to the major pension plans that increased $106 million in the fourth quarter and increased $186 million for the year. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 243% to $484 million in the fourth quarter compared to $141 million in the prior-year quarter, reflecting a significant increase in cash flow from operations and a $22 million decrease in CapEx. Free cash flow for 2012 was $1.2 billion, up 48% from $777 million in 2011. Strong free cash flow generation enabled the return of more than $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders in 2012 through share repurchase and dividends. Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. As you can see from the chart, we've now laid out the major uses of cash, including pension contributions and restructuring cash. Based on the current assumptions, we expect these 2 uses of cash to substantially decline over the next 5 years, resulting in a greater financial flexibility and significantly increased free cash flow. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans' new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. In 2012, we contributed approximately $638 million to our plans. Combined with these steps we've undertaken over the last several years, our overall funding status improved to 82% from 78%, despite an increase in the overall liability from lower discount rate assumptions. We currently expect contributions to decline $90 million to $548 million in 2013 and continue the decline thereafter, resulting in fully funded qualified plans on a GAAP basis by the end of 2016. Additionally, noncash pension expense was roughly $53 million in 2012, and we expect a modest decline in 2013. Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were $143 million in 2012. As our restructuring plans continue to wind down, we would expect cash payments to decline $49 million to approximately $94 million in 2013, before declining further each year thereafter. As we continue to grow, improve operating performance and our required uses of cash decline, we expect our strong free cash flow to continue to be a significant source of value creation for shareholders. In 2012, we took significant steps to unlock that value for shareholders by increasing our strategic position and financial flexibility with the re-domicile to the U.K. The company completed its change in jurisdiction of incorporation on April 2, 2012. And we believe the transaction will help drive shareholder value through: number one, greater global access to expected increases in future free cash flow; number two, an increase in future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term, more than what we've done over the last 5 years, which is approximately 500 basis points; number three, enabled us to access $300 million of excess cash held internationally on our balance sheet during 2012. In summary, we delivered improved growth in 2012, and we have significant leverage to an improving global economy. While we're investing to further strengthen our industry-leading portfolio, we are focused on 3 primary areas that will each contribute to substantially stronger free cash flow over the next several years: first, continued growth and operating margin improvement towards our long-term targets; second, declining uses of cash for pension and restructuring; third, greater capital flexibility and increased cash flow from a lower effective tax rate resulting from our re-domicile to the U.K. Combined with a stronger balance sheet and greater financial flexibility, we've positioned the firm to significant shareholder value creation. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Michael Nannizzi.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Christa, so did you say -- you said mid-single digits improvement in Consulting earnings, is that correct?
Christa Davies: Yes, so HR Solutions operating income will grow mid-single digits in 2013. And we also said that we would expect margin expansion in 2013.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. So, I mean, in order to have double-digit earnings per share growth in the company, what do you need from brokerage or deployment to get there?
Christa Davies: Michael, we're not giving that level of guidance. Really, we've invested significantly in 2012, and we expect that free cash flow growth is really going to be driven by improved growth and operating margin expansion, decreased uses of cash and significant improvements in cash flow from our reduced tax rate. As we think about EPS growth, it's really improvement in operating margin in both Risk and HR, it's effective deployment of capital, as you've seen during 2012 with share buyback, and continued improvements in effective tax rate.
Gregory C. Case: And I'll just add, Michael, as you think about our portfolios come together, the Risk Solutions part of the business ARS first, Aon Benfield, are kind -- a little ahead of where Aon Hewitt is and HR Solutions is, which has sort of come together in terms of overall growth and development of the business, and that's what you're seeing develop here.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then I guess, if I remember right, in the second quarter, I thought, Christa, maybe you had said that the expectations were for margin improvement on a year-over-year basis in Risk in the fourth quarter. Is that right or did I not have my notes right?
Christa Davies: We did originally anticipate that, and what we would say now is there were 2 specific items in the fourth quarter 2012 in Risk Solutions. One was a $7 million impact related to investment income, so a 30-basis-point decline related to that. We did have interest rates decline even further in Australia and Europe, which is hard to believe but true. And then we had a onetime item related to Denmark of $7 million or a 30-basis-point impact. So 60 basis points between those 2 items.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I see. Okay. And then lastly just on the deployment. I mean, do you feel like you're going to be providing free cash flow, I guess from now it sounds like on a quarterly basis? How should we think about the fourth quarter in context? Is that -- are we assuming that, that was facilitated by some of the capital that was freed up during the repatriation? Or is there kind of an increased factor as far as the ability to deploy capital based on what you had given us in the past for expectations in 2012?
Christa Davies: Yes, Michael, it is exactly cash freed up from repatriation. If you look at share repurchase during the course of 2012, we repurchased $1.1 billion. Included in that was $300 million freed up from international cash held on our balance sheet. So $800 million is the underlying amount of share repurchase. And if you think about share repurchases for 2013, we would say it will be similar to 2012. And similarly patterned, a la back-half weighted, given that's where our seasonality in our business and cash generation occurs.
Operator: The next question is from Dan Farrell from Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to ask a follow-up on the Brokerage business. So I know you grew margins if you adjust Denmark. And then, even if you look at the change in the fiduciary income, I think you would've expected that it would be down versus the 14 a year ago. So there is improvement, but it still feels like it didn't come through as much as you might have thought it would. And I'm wondering if there's anything else from an expense or revenue issue that we should be thinking about as we think about earnings power for next year?
Gregory C. Case: Dan, we don't think there is. In fact, if you step back and think about how the margin evolved, Christa highlighted a few one-timers for Q4, which you're always going to have back and forth. As we think about margins for the year, we put it in context of we're up slightly. But what was more important for us from an operating margin leverage standpoint is the investments we were able to make in 2012 and how we were able to absorb them completely and still have positive margins for the year. When you think about our investment in GRIP, which we talked about in the first, second and third quarter, it was really at an unprecedented level as we've rolled that out, with investments in Aon Benfield analytics, Aon Broking, et cetera. So we were able to make a series of investments that we think are fundamentally strengthening the operating leverage of the company and still absorb all that in the year. So from our standpoint, as we reflect on '12, we feel very good about the prospects for '13 and '14 from a margin expansion standpoint. And in many respects, when we think about sort of how those investments have actually played out, and you couldn't have made them in a year and still recovered margin unless they were really starting to pay dividends, we feel actually quite good about progress toward the 26%, as Christa described. And then if you combine that with sort of the engine of the firm, around record or substantial growth, certainly greater than any time over the last number of years, the cash flow generation in that engine is now just kicking in, in the way Christa described, and then the re-domicile of the headquarters to the U.K, which is principally going to help the Risk Solutions business more than any other, we feel good about operating leverage through '13 and '14, in fact, probably stronger now than we did at the beginning of '12.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then one other question just on balance sheet cash. Of the $600 million roughly of unrestricted at the end of the quarter, how much of that do you feel is usable? And then also, there's the $350 million of higher invoicing that's dragging cash. If I recall at the beginning of the year, it was closer to $400 million, so you've had a little unwind. But I thought the beginning of the year felt like most of that would resolve through 2012. And it doesn't seem like that much has. So I'm just wondering on the timing of when the rest of that $350 million actually comes back into the balance sheet cash.
Christa Davies: Right. So we do -- we have made progress during this quarter, approximately $25 million. So at the end of Q3, it was $375 million, at the end of Q4, it was $350 million. We do expect the remaining $350 million to reverse itself during 2013, so that will be a sort of improvement in working capital during the course of 2013.
Operator: The next question is from Adam Klauber from William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: How much did -- what was the investment level in health -- HR Solutions in 2012? And would you expect that investment level to be around the same in 2013, higher or lower?
Christa Davies: Yes. So we originally said, Adam, that would spend $35 million in 2011, an additional $40 million in '12 and that, that would decline in '13, with getting a return on that investment in sort of '14 onwards. We expect that still to be the case. We still will be in investment mode in '13, but we will absorb that investment to generate, as I said, mid-single digit operating income growth for the year. And the way that investment will pattern itself is it will be investing through the first 3 quarters of 2013 and revenue is recognized in Q4. And that's really why, as I described, operating income growth of mid-single digits for the year will be down modestly in the first half and up in the second half.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then as far as the health care exchanges, how big is the retiree exchange, number one? And number two, maybe if you could give some color on the implementation of the active exchanges? From what I've heard, it was a little bumpy on the retiree side, originally. Could you contrast how the implementation has been on the active compared to the retiree, would be helpful?
Gregory C. Case: Well, start overall, I remember describing sort of the opportunities we see as substantial on both the retiree side and on the active side. We watched this market, the potential for this market evolve over the last few years, and we're probably as positive on it as we've ever been, with 48 million eligible retirees out there and 122 million active employees with employer-sponsored plans, there's just tremendous opportunity here. The retiree exchange Navigators, who has about 100,000 retirees on it, it's the leading platform in the industry, it's done very, very well. As we started up last year, we progressed through the normal set of beginnings that one would expect, but have really come through this cycle exceptionally well. Our team couldn't be more pleased with where we stand right now on that platform on our retiree side. And we're investing, as Christa described before, to even strengthen that platform. So we fully believe we've got an industry -- the industry-leading platform on the retiree side with Navigators and going exceptionally well with very, very high interest. And then we're also quite excited about the corporate exchange. There's been a lot of talk out there around exchanges. And we were the first to actually launch it, we made it real. And we brought 3 companies in. We now have over 100,000 enrolled employees, plus dependents. And it's just went exceptionally well, the employee response has been very good, the company response has been very good. And what we're most excited about is the pipeline for 2013. Because as companies have come online and actually seen the concept proven, they're quite excited about the potential to think through how they can both begin to get a bit of a handle on health care cost but do it in a way that really works for their employees, which is very, very important in the process. So we're positive about these investments, feel very, very good about it. The team has done a great job. I've put them in context, this is part of a $3.9 billion, $4 billion HR Solutions business with lots of other things going on, on the retiree side and elsewhere, just exceptional platforms there. But on this specific piece around health care exchanges, feel very good about both the retiree and the corporate exchanges.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple of questions here. First, Greg, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about Europe and what's going on in Europe with respect to your business kind of exposures, any headwinds that you foresee from economic activity?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, I would -- Brian, as you know, we've got very, very strong businesses across Europe and really exceptional platforms. And while it's been variable in different countries, Europe has long been, I think, a fiction of the U.S.'s imagination. This is a whole series of individual countries driving a set of agendas and focus. And we react locally to each one of those situations, and the team has done a very good job, which is why we've been able to grow in Europe in spite of the headwinds. But we're seeing, if you think about characterizing the world, probably a bit more instability and volatility in Europe than maybe anyplace in the world right now. I'd remind you by the way, this has been the -- this would have been the conversation we've been having about the U.S. a few years ago, and we managed through that. We'll do the same on the European front. Does that answer your question?
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, that's terrific. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little more about GRIP here? Is there more investment plans here in 2013, or we're pretty much done with that? And should we start to see the benefits in '13?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, was what we said back to the margin question from before, we made substantial investments in GRIP as we really watched it evolve, and at the beginning of 2012, realized the potential. And really, we're able to absorb those in year, so not only do we make the investments, we're able to absorb and increase margin in year. We'll always continue to invest to build on it. We now are going to move to Health and Benefits in GRIP as well, so there's lots of different opportunities. But I would say the return profile moving into '13 and '14 is exactly what we hoped it would be. And the proof of concept there is we were able to achieve, as we said before, positive margin in '12 even though we made a significant investment. So just start to see that dynamic shift a bit in '13 and '14, we think that bodes very well.
Operator: The next question is from Meyer Shields from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Christa, I just want to clarify your comments. When you talked about the low -- I'm sorry, the mid-single digit growth, was that just in the HR Solutions business or is that for Aon as a whole?
Christa Davies: That was just the mid solutions -- that was just the HR Solutions business.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, I wrote that down wrong. When we look at the planned use of cash, the cash expenditures anticipated for restructuring in 2013 went up, and I was wondering if you could talk about that?
Christa Davies: No, they went down. So if you look at the slide deck that we released, let me just get the page for you. It is -- Page 11 of the deck shows that restructuring cash in 2012 is $143 million and restructuring cash in 2013 is $94 million. Therefore, your question, CapEx?
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: No, the question was the $94 million. I think, in the third quarter, the slide showed $77 million for 2013.
Christa Davies: Yes, look the timing of these amounts will change slightly. So obviously, we're forecasting at any particular point in time. As we complete plans and implement them over time, the numbers will change slightly. But it is -- the long-term amount is declining as each year passes.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Is it reasonable to expect to continue -- I know you might be describing derisking of the defined benefit plans revenues as nonrecurring. Is that something that's nonrecurring for the long term? Or even in the short term, we don't expect a lot of similar revenue?
Gregory C. Case: All we're doing, Meyer, now is pointing out that we had a lot of activity in Q4. It was actually, for the team, it was extraordinary to see. We were in fact privileged to work on some of the most significant situations out there as companies with underfunded pensions are really taking steps and actions to deal with those. You can imagine in many respects, this is like our M&A advisory business or our cap on business that literally, it's going to be lumpy, it's going to be transaction-oriented. We said onetime, because you're going to do it and you're going to that advice with the company in one time, but you can imagine, there are going to be many, many companies over time actually wanting to think about doing this. So we see the potential as quite substantial, and all we were doing is just highlighting in Q4 that there was a lot of activity as really we begin the journey to really take action against this very, very important issue.
Operator: The next question is from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just one, I guess, clarification. Greg, in your initial responses, you talked about still seeing some macro headwinds or the reemergence of macro headwinds in 2013. Was that a European comment or was there other things involved with that?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, what I was really referring to was on the Reinsurance side, just an observation. And if you think about where we are, sort of in the reinsurance world, the capacity really has emerged at an all-time high. So we're at give or take around $500 billion right now. And it references $455 billion in 2011, so there's a substantial increase, people with lots of different activity. There are new sources of capital that want to come in, so whether it's in pension funds or life insurers or high net worth individuals, and by the way, Aon Benfield is incredibly well positioned to help facilitate the entrance of that capital, and at the same time, cedents are increasing retentions. All I was just highlighting is when you think about the headwinds around market impact, you can imagine that could reemerge in '13 at some point, and it's just something we have to deal with, which we've done before.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Great. And one more quick question then. Some of the pension work has closed out things that you worked on. The margin associated with those types of projects tend to be higher or lower than your normal margin?
Christa Davies: I mean, we don't reveal specific margins in our pension business. What I would say is we have an industry-leading platform, and we are doing some of the world's most innovative work. And we're very proud of the work we've done during the course of 2012. And we believe more of that type of derisking and buyout-type activity will occur in 2013.
Gregory C. Case: Jay, this is fundamentally advice on some of the most important topics that affect our clients' balance sheets and operating statements and the work reflects that.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And if I could squeeze in one more question. Capital usage, clearly, you've signaled and you've shown that buybacks for you is the way you're using your excess capital. Why the strong desire to buy back stock versus dividends?
Christa Davies: Jay, we allocate capital, as we've described before, on a return on capital basis, cash on cash. And as we look at the discounted cash-flow view of our own business and valuation, we think we are substantially undervalued today. And on that basis, we think the return on capital share buyback is in excess of dividends. And so we're allocating capital that way. Having said that, we did increase the dividend in 2012. And over time, we'll continue to think about the dividend more.
Operator: The next question is from Matthew Heimermann from JPMC.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I need a little bit of help with Consulting side. And the reason is that, in 2012, in the first half, you characterized about $33 million of investments in health care exchanges as onetime. And if you simply just reverse those, you assume that doesn't recur in 2013, that would get you to the mid-single digit operating income growth, which would kind of imply that there's no growth coming from anywhere else. So I'm just -- that doesn't sound quite right to me. So I'm wondering what I'm missing in that thought process?
Christa Davies: Yes, let me help clarify for you, Matthew. The health care exchanges' investment is not a onetime investment, it's in people and IT, and I would say...
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: But Christa, in the first half, you specifically called out $33 million of investment, which you -- which were incremental to what the kind of ongoing expenses are. So I completely understand that those expenses run ahead of the revenue. But that's what I'm addressing.
Christa Davies: Yes, and what we said, Matthew, for the full year, was that we would invest about $35 million in 2011, an incremental $40 million in the course of 2012. And as I said in my comments, we're investing in 2013 as well, but we're absorbing that investment to deliver mid-single digit operating income growth. And the expense, the way the expense patterns during the course of the year, because revenue is recognized in that business only in Q4, is that you get expense Q1 through Q3, then you get revenue recognized in Q4, which therefore gets sort of improved returns. And that's why you see the patterning that we saw in the first half of '12 versus the second half of '12.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I think the issue then is, and maybe it was just me but I don't think I'm alone in this, is that I think most people perceive those to be incremental to the run rate or perceive them to be characterized as such. So I think when people are kind of asking the question on mid-single digit, that's where the confusion is coming from. Because mid-single digit, like-for-like, doesn't seem unreasonable, but I think most people were thinking you would -- you had some one-offs that likely weren't going to recur. And that's kind of building on kind of how things have been characterized in 4Q. But anyways just...
Christa Davies: Matthew, we continue to say that we think we'll get a return on this health care exchange business in 2014 onwards. It is a long-term investment. It takes quite some time. We described the economics and why the economics take time to scale. We feel very good about the opportunity in the return, that's going to be substantially above our average margin in our HR Solutions business, and therefore help us materially contribute to hitting our 22% long-term target.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I don't disagree with the outlook for exchanges, just noting that. The -- with respect to the growth in 4Q, I was wondering if you could help put that growth in annual -- kind of on an annualized context? Specifically, I mean, is that kind of -- I know disproportionally will be a 4Q revenue recognition, but if I look at kind of the delta relative to what I was looking for, it kind of implies about 100 basis-point kind of annualized benefit for this year. Is that in the ballpark of how you would characterize it?
Gregory C. Case: As we think about -- and you're talking about the HR Solutions business?
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, just the health care exchange benefit to growth, yes.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, the health care, again, put in perspective overall, we're around $3.9 billion, $4 billion top-line business. Of which -- a portion of which, about 40% or so, is on sort of in the category around health. And in that context, we're talking about a much smaller investment in the health care exchanges. It will have an impact on top line, and -- but it's going to be marginal. The engine you're seeing here on the growth side is really driven around the Consulting business, the admin business and HR BPO and the fundamental, the core businesses we've got. Health care exchanges are, again, for us, a very exciting, significant opportunity. As Christa described, we took the position we needed to make significant investments to do that and pull it off, and we did. We're gratified as to where they've come out, both on the retiree side and on the corporate side. We think we're exceptionally well positioned, but we want to be really clear that the big impacts are going to be in '14 and beyond. And we'll see some in '13, in the fourth quarter, but really, the major impacts are going to come there, which are going to be very important to the business overall, but we want to put them in context. It's -- this is an area in the context of a much bigger business.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: What's -- given you called it out in the press release, I guess I'm surprised to hear you characterize that as marginal for 4Q.
Gregory C. Case: Well, what we wanted to highlight in the press release really more than anything else is we launched the first-ever corporate exchange. So it's never been done before. It's 100,000 lives, sort of enrollees on it, with their dependents. And literally, it's been something that's been talked about for quite some time by multiple competitors, and even by our government in the world of exchanges. And Aon Hewitt, our colleagues in Aon Hewitt, were literally, for the first time ever, were able to actually pull that off. So we actually aligned markets, which was a challenge to do. We aligned clients. We actually pulled together this exchange, multi-carrier exchange, and actually proved the concept to really the rest of corporate America that it could be done. As a result of that, by the way, you've seen many of our competitors, all jump on board, everybody talking about their own corporate exchange now, and we now have a pipeline of companies who are interested in the corporate exchange, which are very, very substantial. So that's why we called it out. We think, actually, it's a very -- it's a fundamental crossroad that we were able to get through in a various positive way, but we also don't want to overstep with the impact it's going to have in the near term. Long term, substantial. The near term, less so.
Operator: The next question is from Jay Gelb from Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I was just looking to follow up on Risk Solutions. If -- I'm sort of backing into this, if HR Solutions earnings growth is going to be mid-single digits in 2013, it seems to -- that for Aon to kind of hit expectations, Risk Solutions earnings growth in 2013 will need to be probably 10% or maybe even a little higher. And I mean, I know you haven't really wanted to drill into that level of detail, but it would really be helpful for us in terms of understanding expectations for the rest of the year.
Christa Davies: Jay, we appreciate that it would be helpful for you. And obviously, it would be even more helpful if we gave guidance, but we really don't do that. And the reason we have given specific sort of information around HR Solutions is we have been in an investment year. We did have some unfavorable revenue mix shift during the course of '12, and therefore, we wanted to be specific both around the magnitude of that growth in '13 and the patterning of it. What I would say is if you think about 2013, we expect Risk Solutions operating margin expansion, we expect HR Solutions operating margin expansion, we expect share count to decline. And there are some other miscellaneous items, interest expense to be lower and minority interest to be lower as we've guided.
Gregory C. Case: And your point is correct, though, if you think about sort of, we alluded this before, where our businesses are as they evolve. And Risk Solutions, including ARS and Aon Benfield, are at a -- are literally a few more years along than we are on Aon Hewitt, so you can certainly expect from a growth standpoint as the investments kick in, in a way we believe, and we think in '12, we've proven they will, it gives us a substantial operating leverage in '13. And that's we think you're going to see on the Risk Solutions side. And if you can imagine this conversation, we'll have exactly the same one a year from now, 1.5 years, 2 years from now on the Aon Hewitt side. But right now, Risk Solutions is a little ahead from a growth standpoint, operating income growth standpoint, than Aon Hewitt. and that's -- you're exactly right in terms of sort of how the math is going to come together.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just a real detail question for Christa. The share dilution, should we be using 11 million going forward? Or is that sensitive to other factors, besides the share price, obviously?
Christa Davies: So for Q4, obviously, we finished actual shares outstanding at 310.9 million or 11.5 million dilutive share equivalents. So that means you're dilutive share count start point for 1/1/2013 is 322.4 million. And as you think about sort of going forward 2013, we issue about 5 million to 6 million shares a year. And then obviously, you should think about what sort of share buyback you plug in, there's sort of the input variables.
Operator: The next question is from Mike Zaremski from Crédit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I'm hoping to revisit GRIP, because frankly I feel investors have been really unable to measure the impact the initiative is having. So I guess, investment in GRIP was cited as having a negative impact in Risk Solutions within the slide deck. If there's a way to quantify that, that would be helpful. And related, I know you've talked about GRIP increasing the yield per dollar of premium placed. So how could we translate that into how it's impacted the margin, how you expect that to trend going forward?
Gregory C. Case: So if you step back and think about what GRIP is about and what it enables us to do, so because we can -- we're able to now track the premium placement across our overall network with roughly $80 billion of ground [ph] premium we can look at, we're actually able to have conversations with insurance partners around how and where they want to apply capital, and in different places around our network and around the world. And that's actually quite advantageous for our clients, first and foremost, and most important, but also for the insurance carriers. And in that context, we have been literally able to offer opportunities, contracts to insurance carriers, and literally, they've come online and actually been able to improve their performance and strengthen what we actually give to clients. So fundamentally, that's one area that GRIP allows us to attack in a way that really we don't think very few, if anyone out there, can do. And in that context, that's literally what the investment in '12 was about. It was literally how we rolled that on, brought people on around that, completed the technology pieces around that, and really, really advanced and ramped up the expense. That's why it had a negative impact on margin. But if we invested all that in GRIP in '12, you have to imagine we've got some revenue, too, which is why we literally were able to invest a huge amount in '12 and keep margins flat/up a little bit for the year. So if you think about sort of how that's going to evolve in '13, that investment starts to ramp down a bit as we've got that in place, and the proven revenue against that, which we now have seen, actually comes to the fore. And that's why we believe there's real operating leverage we didn't have before in '13 and '14 that actually emerge out of these investments over the last couple of years.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And so how can we size up the rev? Does it produce $20 million, $50 million, $80 million of revenue, like any numbers behind the initiative?
Gregory C. Case: So from our view, we think one of the advantages -- we know one of the advantages we have that's really unique is our ability to understand and apply data in a way that changes carrier performance and actions and benefits our clients. That is a fundamental, substantial competitive advantage. So we're not going to quantify the GRIP outcome. We're not going to quantify the investments. We think they'll both be substantial. The thing we'd ask you to look at and come back to is Brokerage margin. So flat out Risk Solutions, Brokerage margin really is the metric that we think at the end of the day is your '13 measure around, do we have the operating leverage. From our standpoint, this story around Aon has not changed over the last 5, 6 years. Exact same strategy, exact same progression. We drove a lot of coordination around expense and improved margin, as Christa described, 300, 400 basis points over the last few years, 500 basis points since '05. And by the way, we now shifted, and say, we've got to invest to literally build capability to take the next step. We've now done that over the last couple of years. We think we've proven that in '12 and for ourselves in terms of what the economic leverage is, and we think you'll see that going forward. But the play side I'd ask you to look as a proof point, the only proof point, is going to be Risk Brokerage margin, which we think is a very compelling one for you guys.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And lastly, Christa, in regards to the tax rate guidance of 26% next -- this year, I think that's flat with 2012. So why shouldn't that rate go lower given the re-domicile benefits? And I believe, for example, the U.K. corporate tax rate will continue to fall in 2013, 2014?
Christa Davies: Yes. So it's not about the U.K., and what we would say is our estimate at this point in time is 26%. We have said that we would achieve benefits of approximately 500 -- or more than 500 basis points over the long term. And it's not going to be sort of neatly patterned. And as we make progress and complete activities, we will update you in future periods.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: But the U.K. matters, because you do generate 15% plus of your revenues in the U.K., right?
Christa Davies: It actually doesn't have an impact on our global effective tax rate.
Operator: I will now turn the call back over to Greg Case.
Gregory C. Case: Terrific. Just wanted to say to everybody, thank you very much for participating, we appreciate it, and look forward to the next call. Thanks very much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon's plc Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that the information to note that some the comments in today's call may constitute certain looking statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or for those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences as described in the press release covering our third quarter results, as well as being posted on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc. Sir, you may begin.
Gregory C. Case: Thank you, Catherine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter Conference Call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. And we note there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders, second is overall organic growth performance and third is continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic. Our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: Grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share. Turning to Slide 3. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 4% overall driven by improved rate of organic growth in both Risk and HR Solutions. Operating margin increased 30 basis points, and savings related to our restructuring programs and operational discipline absorbed continued investments we are making in new growth opportunities and in key talents across our businesses. Finally, EPS increased 8% to $0.95, reflecting solid operating performance and effective capital management. Overall, the focus remains on annual performance and achieving these metrics over the course of the year. However, I would note that our third quarter reflects improvement in each of our 3 metrics for the first time since the beginning of 2009 that we delivered this result in a single quarter. Christa will provide further and additional financial commentary in a few minutes, reinforcing that we're on track with our long-term targets and has continued to take significant steps to further position the firm for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior-year quarter, with growth across every major business. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction. New business generation of more than $230 million across our Retail business, with double-digit new business growth in many markets globally across Asia and Pacific regions. Investments in new product and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP and Aon Broking globally. And in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 6 consecutive quarters. Reflecting on the individual businesses. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2%, similar to the prior-year quarter. The exposures are relatively stable and the impact on pricing was modestly positive on average, reflecting the steady pace of improvement over the last 12 months. We saw strong growth in the renewal book portfolio in Latin America and in our Affinity business. U.S. Retail was stable as growth in Health and Benefits and property/casualty markets were offset by continued weakness in the commercial construction market. In international, organic revenue growth was 3%, also similar to the prior-year quarter. Exposures are relatively stable and the impact from pricing was flat on average with firmer pricing in cat-exposed regions. We saw a strong growth in emerging markets, New Zealand and in many regions across Asia, including double-digit growth in areas such as India and Taiwan. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, macroeconomic conditions remained fragile across many core markets. However, our leadership positions across this region where we saw strong retention rates and management of our renewal book portfolio, delivered modest growth. Overall, solid performance given the economic headwinds. In reinsurance, organic revenue growth improved to 7% compared to a decline of 1% in the prior-year quarter. The results reflect solid growth across each business. In treaty, as mentioned before, net new business won was positive for the sixth quarter in a row, including unfavorable impact from market pricing in the near-term primarily due to losses incurred in the prior year from property cat-exposed regions. Additionally, we saw solid growth from facultative placements and capital markets transactions and advisory services, which tend be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. Overall, this level of performance and strength in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's compelling value proposition for clients of strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability. I would note that our fourth quarter of 2011 in reinsurance benefited from significant level of capital markets transactions that we do not expect to repeat in Q4 this year, as well as caution that excess capital continues to build in the industry and cedents continue to retain more risk. Absent any events in the industry, macro factors may return as a headwind that we're going to have to overcome as we move into 2013. Turning to HR Solutions. Overall organic growth improved to 4% compared to a decline of 1% in the prior-year quarter. We saw the rate of organic growth improve across both consulting and outsourcing despite weak discretionary spend globally and continued economic pressure in Continental Europe. Performance also reflects growth rates in areas where we're making significant investments in the business, in areas such as investment consulting, pension risk management consulting and HR BPO. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's understanding of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risk continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations that are delivered at a local level. In addition, managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. And finally, after continuing to work through the worst economic recession in the last 7 years, clients are just beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development and engagement, to prepare themselves for potential renewed growth long-term. Turning to the individual businesses. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to a decline of 1% in the prior-year quarter. The results reflect strong demand for delegated pension risk management and investment consulting services, strong growth in talent rewards and solid growth across our businesses in Asia. The results are partially offset by a decline in discretionary spend for material [ph] services in core retirement consulting internationally. In outsourcing, organic revenue growth improved to 4% compared to a decline of 2% in the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth in HR BPO from both new client wins and in discretionary products and services such as dependent eligibility audits. We also saw a modest growth in Benefits Administration driven by net client wins and an increase in project-related revenue, partially offset by anticipated price compression. Overall, in HR Solutions, we delivered solid organic revenue performance in the third quarter and continue to execute on strategic investments that will drive additional long-term growth across our industry-leading platform. Slide 5 highlights the third topic. Further areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include: In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position in health care exchanges, both in the retiree and active markets. Health care exchanges enable clients to begin the shift of their participants to a more market-based defined contribution model for health care, while addressing unsustainable health care cost increases and decreasing population health. While already a leader in the retiree market, we recently announced the launch of the industry's first and only fully-insured multicarrier corporate health care exchange, with more than 100,000 participants. Really outstanding progress in this area as we look to scale it in 2013 and 2014. We're expanding our outsourcing offerings in high-growth areas such as dependent eligibility audits. We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology from large market to middle market. And we're developing new delegated solutions in investment consulting and pension risk management that leverage our total capabilities across advisory and delivery services. A great example in this area was our recent advisory work for a large client around pension settlement and derisking activities which led to one of the largest insured annuity settlement transactions in U.S. history. Finally, we're strengthening our international footprint to support our global workforce, with investments in key talent and capabilities across Asia and emerging markets. In Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the revenue engine internationally, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates. We continue to invest in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information. We now have more than 1.5 million trades, more than $76 billion of bound premium and a growing client list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and servicing capabilities. In addition, we're driving around broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. Effective January 1, we aligned our global Health and Benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep Brokerage capabilities. Finally, we're spending our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients, as well as adding key talent across Asia in specialty sectors and in our GRIP services business. Overall, we've proved the concept of these major investments and begun to scale these opportunities in 2012. And as we complete 2012 and move into 2013, we are on plan to deliver greater scale and increased operating leverage. In summary, we delivered improved organic revenue growth across both Risk and HR Solutions, made significant strategic investments that will deliver greater long-term growth and took important steps to strengthen our global firm, highlighted by the re-domicile from Chicago to London, completed earlier this year. With key numbers of the management team now fully reallocated to London, and as a U.K. headed multinational group, we're seeing increased interaction with international and emerging market clients, strengthening our relationship with the London markets, increasing our international brand awareness and driving financial benefits related to the transaction. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our performance reflects solid organic revenue growth and significant steps to strengthen our global firm. From a financial perspective, our third quarter results overall exceeded our previous expectations. We continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve our operating performance, deliver savings from our formal restructuring programs and generate strong free cash flow growth. We are effectively allocating capital, as highlighted by the repurchase of 275 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. I would note, this is more share repurchase than we've done in any quarter in the past year, and is reflection, in our belief, in the strength of the firm. Now, let me turn to the financial results as highlighted on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 8% to $0.95 per share for the third quarter compared to $0.88 in the prior-year quarter. Results reflect solid organic growth, restructuring savings, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management in the quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and $4 million of re-domicile costs, primarily for legal and advisory fees with the completed re-domicile on April 2. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on earnings per share in the quarter. If currency would have remained stable at today's rates, we would expect a very modest unfavorable translation impact to EPS in the fourth quarter of 2012. Now, let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 20%, and operating income decreased 1% versus the prior-year quarter. Included in operating income was a $10 million impact related to both unfavorable foreign currency translation and a decline in investment income from lower short-term interest rates globally. Organic revenue growth and restructuring savings primarily absorbed the significant investments we are making in our GRIP platform and in key talent across Asia and Latin America. Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding investments and long-term structural margin expansion. With respect to the Aon Benfield program, savings in the third quarter are estimated at $36 million compared to $30 million in the prior-year quarter. The Aon Benfield program is expected to deliver cumulative expense savings of $146 million in 2012 compared to the cumulative savings of $122 million in 2011. Further, associated with the transfer of the Health and Benefits business at January 1, 2012, an estimated $46 million of restructuring savings under the Aon Hewitt program will be achieved in Risks Solutions. Approximately $33 million of the $46 million in cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, including an estimated $7 million of incremental savings in the third quarter. A breakout of restructuring charges is incurred in Risk Solutions, associated with the Aon Hewitt program, is detailed in the schedules on Page 13 of the press release. For the first 9 months of 2012, Risk Solutions margin is up 10 basis points, and Risk Solutions operating income is up 2%, absorbing significant investments in the business, lower investment income and unfavorable foreign currency translation. We continue to expect strong operating performance in the fourth quarter driven by seasonal strength, less investment spend and increased return on investments as we begin to scale long-term initiatives, resulting in margin expansion for the full year and placing up on track to deliver our long-term target of 26%. Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%. Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 17.5%, and operating income increased 11% compared to the prior-year quarter. Included was a $5 million favorable impact from FX. Organic revenue growth of 4%, $20 million of incremental restructuring savings and an increase in cost that were deferred related to the timing of large client implementations, more than offset our significant investments in long-term growth initiatives and an unfavorable revenue mix shift. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $16 million of charges in the quarter. Cumulative savings related to the formal restructuring program in the third quarter are estimated at $64 million compared to $37 million in the prior-year quarter, of which approximately $7 million of the incremental savings were achieved in the Risk segment. At the beginning of the year, we provided specific comments regarding the outlook for HR Solutions in 2012: Number one, we expect improved organic growth in both businesses in 2012; number two, we would invest approximately $35 million in new growth opportunities, primarily our health care exchanges, HR BPO, investment consulting and pension risk management; number three, approximately 75% of the restructuring savings would be realized in adjusted operating income; number four, expected performance would improve in the second half of the year, primarily as investment spend decreases in the second half from the first half. Overall, our results reflect a solid performance in the third quarter, and we are on track with the plans that we had laid out at the beginning of the year. We are always cautious not to overplay the results of one quarter. With the fourth quarter, we expect continued organic growth to deliver on restructuring savings and make further progress against key investments, resulting in operating income and margin up modestly, similar to our previous guidance, placing us on track for improved performance in 2013. Turning to the next slide, on our long-term operating margin targets. We continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve operating performance on an annual basis. While we've improved operating margins 500 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 26% for Risk Solutions reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 5 ways: Number one, deliver $20 million of remaining restructuring savings and deliver other operational improvements; number two, continued rollout of the revenue engine internationally; number three, Aon Broking and GRIP-related initiatives. These 3 are fully within our control. In addition, there were 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant operating leverage based on improvements in the external markets; number four, increases in short-term interest rates; and number five, industry improvements, driving higher insured values or insurance pricing. Similarly, for HR Solutions, while we've improved operating margins nearly 1,200 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 22% reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 3 ways: number one, deliver $56 million of remaining restructuring savings after the transfer of savings for Health and Benefits; number two, growth in the core business and return on incremental investments, including health care exchanges; number three, improvements in HR BPO. Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on the next slide. Unallocated expenses were $46 million, including nonrecurring costs for certain employee benefit plans and increased operating expenses related to the re-domicile. Interest income decreased $3 million due to lower average interest rates and average cash balances. Interest expense decreased $3 million due primarily to a decline in the average rate on total debt outstanding. Other expense had an unfavorable impact of $7 million, including a $16 million loss on the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, partially offset by gains on certain company-owned life insurance plans and other long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million per quarter of interest income, $40 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations decreased to 23.2% in the third quarter compared to 28.9% in the prior-year quarter. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2012 was favorably impacted by certain discrete tax adjustments. We currently anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 26% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and going forward, excluding any discrete tax adjustments. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 331 million in the third quarter compared to 336.9 million in the prior-year quarter, due primarily to our share repurchase program. The company repurchased 5.4 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $275 million in the third quarter and has approximately 4.5 billion of remaining authorization actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 318.7 million, and there are approximately 10.4 million dilutive equivalents. Now, let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1 billion, and total debt outstanding was $4.4 billion. Overall debt to capital was 34.6% at September 30 compared to 35.7% at December 31. Cash flow from operations increased 63% to $598 million compared to $368 million in the prior-year quarter. Despite a higher organic growth rate, low working capital requirements more than offset an increase in cash taxes and cash contributions to the major pension plans in the quarter. Furthermore, we continue to operate with elevated levels of invoicing and cash collections, approximately $375 million related to a delay in invoicing in Aon Hewitt which began in the second half of 2011 with the conversion of certain order to cash systems. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 66% to $526 million compared to $316 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in free cash flow reflects a 63% increase in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $20 million increase in CapEx. Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continued to de-risk certain plan assets. In 2011, we contributed approximately $477 million to our plans. In prior quarters, we had noted that 2012 contributions were expected to be $541 million before any discretionary contributions, primarily reflecting a decline in discount rates from 2011. On September 30, we completed a merger of 5 of the 7 legacy Aon and Hewitt U.K. pension schemes into a single plan. In addition to decreased management time and improved governance, additional benefits are expected to be derived through improved operating efficiencies, reduced adviser and asset management costs and a high level of control over investments. In conjunction with this transaction, we made a discretionary contribution of approximately $80 million. As a result, we now expect pension contributions to be $641 million in 2012 and would expect contributions to decline annually beginning in 2013, despite a decline in discount rates year-to-date, resulting in fully funded plans on a GAAP basis in 2016. Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were $178 million in 2011. As our restructuring plans continue to wind down, we would expect cash payments to decline $29 million to approximately $149 million in 2012 before declining further in 2013. As we continue to grow, improve operating performance and our required uses of cash decline over the next several years, we expect our strong free cash flow to be a significant source of value creation for shareholders. As an important step in unlocking that value for shareholders, on April 2, the company completed its change in jurisdiction of incorporation from Delaware to the U.K We believe the transaction will help drive shareholder value through: Number one, providing greater global access to expected increases in future free cash flow; number two, enable us to access roughly $300 million of excess capital held internationally on our balance sheet; number three, increase future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term, more than we've done over the last 5 years, which is approximately 500 basis points. In summary, we are on track for stronger growth in 2012, and we have significant leverage through an improving global economy. While we're investing to further strengthen our industry-leading portfolio, we are focused on 3 primary areas that will each contribute to substantially stronger free cash flow over the next several years: First is continued growth and operating margin improvement towards our long-term targets; second, declining uses of cash to pension and restructuring; third, greater capital flexibility and increased cash flow from a lower effective tax rate resulting from our re-domicile to the U.K. Combined with a strong balance sheet and greater financial flexibility, we've positioned the firm to significant shareholder value creation. With that, I'd like to call -- turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Adam Klauber of William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Could you tell us how much, to date, have you invested in the health care exchanges? And how much, I guess, total do you expect invest? And could you talk about -- I realize it's a very long-term process, but what's the potential of ramp-up in clients in the different exchanges?
Gregory C. Case: Well, as of -- on the health care exchange front, as we've made a number of investments that we talked about and very excited about the overall platform. To date, we targeted, as we said before, about $75 million in the investment, about $40 million, which was last year and $35 million in this year in 2012. And pleased to say, we were able to launch our first-ever, as I described before, corporate exchange, which is coming live in the fourth quarter. It's the first time this ever occurred, 100,000 lives. Very excited about that. And as you know, we've got a very, very strong retiree exchange as well and our Navigators exchange. Just for context, if you think about it, there are 48 million eligible retirees out there. And an additional context on the corporate side, 122 million active employees today. And all of those are in an environment in which sort of increasing health care costs are clearer everywhere, employers are looking for ways to actually sort through that complexity. Not only are costs going up but health is actually deteriorating. So we see a substantial amount of opportunity in this is over the long term. And that's why we made the investments and are very excited about these platforms and what they can mean for us. As we said at the first quarter, we see the real impact happening more in '14, '15, et cetera. We're going to see impact in '13, but it's really going to happen in '14 and '15, so these are investments for the long term. But I would say, much like the overall story for Aon Hewitt, we feel very good about these, these are stable on track and actually progressing just as we thought they would and are excited about the overall investment.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And just one follow-up. HR margins were clearly good. Were there any sort of onetime or favorable items that helped the margins this quarter?
Christa Davies: What I would say is it was a little better than our expectations. A lot of things moved in the right direction, and we do believe that we're on track with previous guidance with operating income up modestly in Q4 and continued progress in 2013.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A couple of questions. I guess, sticking with HR and the margins, you did refer to some, I guess, deferred expenses, which sounded like it helped the earnings. Can you explain what that is? And if they're deferred, does that mean higher expenses in later periods?
Christa Davies: Right. Great question, Jay. So the third costs are really related to the timing of large client implementations and so when clients go live, we defer those costs from the P&L on to the balance sheet. So that's essentially the way mechanics work. And it's really just related to the timing of when clients go live. And so, that was a significant impact on the quarter and continues to be a part of the way we operate the economics of the business.
Gregory C. Case: But I think about, Jay, [ph] overall, about just how margin's going to progress, Jay, as we described before. We intend to make progress year to year. Third quarter is an indication that we step forward, as we reflect on 2012. When we finish Q4, we believe we'll have made a modest progress as Christa described. And we believe we're well-positioned to make modest progress in '13 and continue on the march for the 22% target.
Christa Davies: Just one other note, Jay. We are deferring revenue that's matching those deferred expenses, so we're matching revenue and expense. So you're not going to get some incremental expense going forward without the incremental revenue.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it, now that make sense. And then separately, if you can give us an update on GRIP. I don't know if you can talk about how many insurance companies you've got signed up to the platform and what your goals are for that product?
Gregory C. Case: Well, as we've described before, and if you think about GRIP in the context of what we're trying to accomplish on the overall Risk Solutions platform, what we said before, when you think about how we grow the business, we can increase the number of clients, increase the wallet share we've got with them or increase the yield per dollar of premium placed. And that's exactly squarely where the GRIP world fits, increasing yield per dollar premium placed. And it really is -- it's -- for us, it's about how we put the platform in place and how we build it over time. And as you described, Jay, we made very good progress with it. We've got, as I described before, almost $80 billion of premium sort of in the GRIP system. We've talked before about multiple carriers who've signed on to this, substantially proven the concept, as we described before. And what we see in '12 is we're really rolling that out. And it's really having substantial impact not only with our carriers but with our clients, this having a substantial impact in helping us really match capital with client need in a very substantial way, and it's increased our level of service. So we're very positive on the GRIP platform, and it really is the reason. As we said in Q1, we've seen so much progress with it, we proved the concept and now, we're scaling up the concept as we roll out the platform.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: But no disclosure on how many insurance companies are on the platform at this point?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, it's really not about the number. It's really about what we're trying to do and how we're actually increasing the yield per dollar of premium placed. So you're going to see the impact of GRIP show up in that yield, show up in margin over time. And it's much more -- it's much deeper than just literally market by market. We're actually seeing benefits beyond just signing off insurance markets.
Operator: The next question is coming from Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes. Just a couple of quick ones here. First, Christa, is it possible to give us what the capital markets benefit was for the reinsurance organic revenue growth rate this quarter?
Christa Davies: Hang on. Just looking for that. I think it was like 100 basis points, roughly.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Excellent. And then Christa, another quick question here. On the tax rate guidance, the 26% for the remainder of the year, is that -- when I think about your 500 basis points that you're going to get over -- or more than 500 basis points from the redomestication, is that kind of the baseline I should be thinking about?
Christa Davies: So we did start -- before the transaction, our effective tax rate was 29%. And so you can see we're making progress on the benefits of the move to the U.K. already with the tax rate decline from 29% to 26% this quarter. And so, and we did say this quarter, the tax rate benefits from the transaction would be more than 500 basis points. So what I would say in regards to that is we had an overall plan in place and as we continue to execute on that plan, and we get more certainty on it, we'll continue to update you.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got you. And then -- and just lastly, I just want to follow-up on Jay's question. Is there any way that you could actually qualify where the deferral in revenues and expenses were in the quarter with respect to the HR Solutions business? Just so we can kind of look at the different ratios and how they're really kind of working?
Christa Davies: Yes, we did say it was significant. We haven't revealed that number. And look, we would say it's related to the timing of large client implementations in both our BPO and benefits administration station business. And it will be lumpy by quarter as client implementations phase in.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ray Iardella of Macquarie.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Just, I guess, 2 questions for me. First, maybe talk a little bit about the construction business. You mentioned some weakness there, I think, in the U.S. Just curious, one of your competitors suggested it might be getting a little bit better. Just curious what you guys are seeing?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, it's -- as you know, we've got a very, very strong construction business, not only across the U.S., but really globally. The most significant in the industry. It is a sector which we like a lot for the long term. In fact, irrespective -- you kind of look at the analysis a lot of different ways, but you're in the trillions when you think about sort of the infrastructure build that's going to be required around the globe, we've estimates 10 trillion to 15 trillion over the course of the next couple of decades. So we love the sector. We love the space. And we've simply made the most significant set of investments in this space. But in that regard, this has been a headwind for us for the last number of quarters. With the headwind for us this quarter, we definitely see some potential positive signs. But for us, this is a very, very substantial bet, bigger than anyone else's. And as we start to see benefits, we think they will be substantial, but for now, we see progress, then we see good pipeline, but we haven't seen it in the quarter yet.
Christa Davies: And I just wanted to follow-up with Brian's question earlier on reinsurance revenues. The capital markets impact in the quarter was closer to 200 basis points of organic revenue growth. And I would want to note that Q4 2011 was a significant capital markets quarter. And so, as we think about Q4 2012, that will be a difficult comparable.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: And one other follow-up, if I could. In terms of M&A, just curious, I mean, do you guys kind of see going out, the pipeline still looking pretty good? And is that, I believe you talked about in the past, $200 million to $300 million of cash kind of allocated towards M&A?
Gregory C. Case: That's exactly where we continue to be. For us, really, is take a step back, Ray. This is -- we like the platform and the portfolio we've put in place. It's taken us 6 to 7 years to get here. As you think about sort of the addition of Benfield, the addition of Hewitt to the mix and a number of acquisitions that have been really tucked in to build content and capability for us, for us, the M&A strategy is not about size, it's about adding true content, capability that will support our clients. And in that regard, we really continue to see the $200 million to $300 million investments in these smaller tuck-in acquisitions around the world to really being part of the formal part of the strategy.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just quickly, Christa, on the reinsurance piece. I imagine the guidance that you've kind of put out there contemplates the reinsurance trend that you're talking about, is that right? For 4Q?
Christa Davies: Yes, it does.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then one question was on the buybacks. How much of the buyback in the third quarter was funded from the additional funds made available via redomestication? And kind of how much is left, I guess?
Christa Davies: Yes. Look, as we think about buybacks for calendar year 2012, we are on track to buy back more in 2012 than 2011. And obviously, we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, that was close to $150 million a quarter, plus use of the international cash on the balance sheet. And we just think about it as an overall pool, including the cash flow of the company and the cash that's shored up in some [ph] investments on the balance sheet.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it, okay. And then can you elaborate a bit on your comments? I mean, Greg, the -- in the press release about the Europe impact on discretionary consulting? And maybe also, on a related note, the increase in discretionary demand for BPO. Just want to understand that of how that's fits with the macro in Europe.
Gregory C. Case: Yes. Really, the overall macro point, which is really the key one here you're raising, Michael, is really we see certainly, pressure around the world, as you read about everyday and we see it, really, from every corner of the world. But it's different. And right now, as we look at the sort of the global landscape, there's certainly pressure in the European quadrant. It happens to be a place where we have substantial, very strong and solid basis. And it's just part of how Aon was built over time. And in that context, what we're seeing is essentially, if you're client, in that context, if you've got something you can defer, you can push back, from a discretionary standpoint, you're going to do that. So that, really, is the comment on discretionary spend and sort of the pressure we're seeing in the context of that. But having said that, the platform we've got is exceptionally strong. And this is not B2C business, this is really B2B. And at the end of the day, at the heart of it, clients have risk issues and people issues. And that's why even in the context in the sort of the -- if you think about what's happened over the last number of years, Aon has grown the business every year, I mean, except for one, and that was we were, I think, down 1%. So we've essentially been able to, in the face of very strong economic headwinds, continue to grow the business and build the business, that's really one of the hallmarks of the overall platform of Aon, and it's one of the things we build upon. So there's a lot of pressure and it's had impact on the quarter, but there's a lot number of things we can do sort of against that. And then from a BPO standpoint, this is really about the HR topic more broadly and just overall, when you think about the things we are looking and taking the clients to sort of combat this sort of issue of discretionary spend, are things that can really have impact for them in the near-term. Things like dependent eligibility audits, leave of absence reviews, things like that. Project revenues that we can really help them improve the operating performance of their business in the near term. But these are the things we're actually bringing to them now that are different. So the mix has changed a bit, the pressure is real, but Aon's got a very strong platform to deal with it.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then lastly, the retail U.S. in Risk, what happened there? I mean, you mentioned a little bit about exposures and we've heard a lot about pressure on exposures in U.S. risk. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and maybe the balance of that versus the other aspects of North America?
Gregory C. Case: Yes. Let's step back. As we talked about on the retail side, 2% growth sort of in the Americas in the quarter, and that really comes across all the Americas. But we would reflect overall, Michael, 3% year-to-date. So that's the number I'd sort of have you think about. That's roughly where we expect sort of the year to play out. We obviously aspire for more across-the-board, and we're making substantial investments to achieve that. And those are starting to really make a difference a la the GRIP question from before. But that's roughly how we're looking at it. Remember, we've got a few sectors on the -- and we talked about construction before and a few others that we've made particular investments in that we like a lot but have particular headwinds for us sort of in the near term, and that really is what constrains us a bit. But we feel like the growth profile that we've achieved year-to-date is meaningful, and will continue going forward.
Operator: The next question is coming from Matthew Heimermann of JPMorgan Chase.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A couple of questions. First, just on the BPO business, when you guys acquired Hewitt, that was a business that basically had no margin whatsoever. And I think one of the goals was to, one, reprice that business. And as you put new business on, that old business rolled off, you get margin gains. So I guess, my question is at this point in the game, have we seen any material margin contribution from that? Or is that to come when we think about some of the implementation revenues that you were talking about earlier?
Christa Davies: Yes. Look, we are very pleased with the improvement in that business. It now does have positive margins, so we continue to sort of improve margins over time. We're working very hard to get them to a 15% margin by 2015, as we originally outlined as part of the transaction.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So still more to go when we think 2013 versus '12, and '14 versus '13, '15 versus '14, et cetera?
Christa Davies: Absolutely, yes. It's continued improvement year-over-year.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then, just with respect to the timing issue on margins, right, so there's some expenses that don't show up but there's also revenue that doesn't show up. So when we think about the margins you reported in the quarter, I mean, you implied that was a positive. If you had, had both the expenses in the revenue show up, should we have thought about margins differently than what we saw this quarter?
Christa Davies: Yes. Look, I think I wouldn't over induct too much from one quarter. I'd look more at the year because things do move sort of -- and there were a few things that moves in our direction in Q3. And so, as you look at the overall year, that's a good indication. Deferred expenses and deferred revenue both happen and match, you're right. But deferred cost did have a positive impact on the quarterly results. But again, look at the overall year, and we really think that our operating income and operating margins will continue to improve in 2013.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. It just -- it seemed like when you first answered, I just was following-up from the standpoint that when you first answered the question, it sounded more negative, then on the follow-up, it sounded neutral, and then it sounded a little negative again. So the real takeaway is there's always noise quarter-to-quarter, and so it might've been a little bit positive-negative, but we shouldn't play that forward in any way, shape or form.
Christa Davies: That's exactly right, Matthew. Yes, that's right.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then the last question just on exchanges. I mean, the right way to track your progress in this business over the next couple of years, I'm assuming is going to be more about the lives you have in the exchanges than the client wins? But obviously, they are linked. So I wanted to just, one, make sure that, that was correct. And two, when we think about the -- obviously, we need client wins to drive lives. But give us a sense of how, from the outside perspective, what some of the data points on the client side we should kind of think about over the next couple of years to kind of measure progress here?
Gregory C. Case: So, Matthew, you're exactly right. Again, what we're doing here is we've launched 2 exchanges. We have 2 businesses that one's been in place, the Navigators on the retiree side, against a pool of 48 million eligible retirees over time. That's been in place for a number of years, is tracking well, and we are adding clients to that. And then we've launched the corporate exchange. As I described before, this is different set against the set of 122 million active employees. And you're exactly right. What we want to able to do is these need to be up and running, which they are. Running well, which they are. Adding new clients, which we are. And you're tracking that over time and tracking the number of lives that we're actually able serve. We're excited about, as we said before, with 100,000 lives in the corporate exchange, we're truly proving a concept. It's something that's never been done before that gives CFOs and heads of HR and business leaders, the opportunity to really deal with the increasing health care costs, but do it in a way that they can serve their employee base as well. And we're quite excited about that. So in many respects, we've got 2 highly viable new businesses up and running that really are changing the shape and the foundation of how businesses think about health care coverage over time. And so for us, it is making sure we've solidly proven those concepts and then growing those overtime. And you're exactly right, for 2013, it's about how we add companies and clients to that list, and then how we add lives to that list. And that's exactly what we are on track to do.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just -- yes, I'm sorry.
Christa Davies: And as we think about the economic model of health care exchanges for us, we're earning a commission on the premium placed which is a very attractive economic model. And as we scale participants overtime, that becomes more economic. And that's really how the return comes in sort of 2014 onwards.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, I'm assuming you also get some economics from the administration piece of it, correct, which was -- which is kind of an HR benefits administration-like service, correct?
Christa Davies: A little bit, yes.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then I just wanted to clarify one other issue. I mean, a lot of the conversations around us now with -- who knows what's going to happen with the election, but obviously, people are talking about possibilities that they didn't -- weren't talking about maybe a month ago. But can you talk -- I mean, I think there's a perception out there that this is -- your investment is basically a binary outcome on Obamacare. Can you tell us why that's not the case? I have my own view, but I'd like to hear yours.
Gregory C. Case: Well, I really appreciate you raising that because we don't see -- the election, obviously, of interest to everyone, but doesn't really have a particular impact directly on the investments we're making here. And again, if you step back, just think about the corporate exchange for a minute. 122 million active employees today, when you think about the companies, in their opinions. We've actually surveyed -- if you remember, we actually have access and connections to, literally, in top thousand companies around the world, all their heads of HR and all their CFOs. 94% have committed to health care coverage. So overwhelmingly saying, we're going to provide some way. We're going to make sure there's coverage available so no one's going to walk away here. And only 1/3 really have a strategy to do that. So there's a great opportunity for us to help them bring clarity to what that space looks like. And we actually surveyed them, and even without an exchange in place, a full 43% of them have said, they're willing to try an exchange. So just think about that in the context sort of the overall corporate environment. A tremendous opportunity of companies saying, "My gosh, we have a problem. " And remember, Obamacare, or whatever you want to describe it, health care coverage as it currently exists, doesn't fundamentally address the issue of expense here at all, nor does it address the issue of wellness. So expense is going up, and wellness is going down. That is a fundamental reality and that's where we're really helping companies think through. So it's really independent of political parties, it's independent of policy, it's a fundamental business set of reasons, which are driving our investment in health care exchanges, and that's why we're so excited about them. Fundamentally, we win when our clients win. And in this case, there is a massive, massive issue for them that they've got to address, and this is a very viable platform for them to address that issue.
Operator: The next question is coming from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: All right. I wanted to just clarify 2 things. One, for Christa. You called out that the capital markets or the reinsurance comparables are a difficult one for the fourth quarter. You also quantified the impact for this quarter. Can you do the same for the fourth, just give us the exact numbers?
Christa Davies: For the fourth quarter...
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: In terms of what it was last year so we can model accordingly.
Christa Davies: Almost all of it what was capital markets in Q4 2011 is a good way to think about it. It keeps...
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Almost all the growth?
Christa Davies: [indiscernible] smallest quarter for reinsurance.
Gregory C. Case: Yes. It's both a combination, really. Q4 is the smallest quarter for us and we just had a very, very -- it was a great client-to-client example for us, but a very substantial win in Q4 last year. And that's not going to be here this year. So in that context, that's really the market comparable. And this is really just the fundamental issue around the lumpiness of our fact business and our capital markets business. Be clear, we expect to grow this business over time. We expect modes growth in this business over time. The Aon Benfield platform is just done wonderfully well. As both Christa and I described, 6 consecutive quarters of treaty net wins. By the way, we see treaty growth positive in the fourth quarter, although as Christa described, our smallest quarter, but it's just going to be offset by a substantial, substantial transaction that happened in Q4 2011.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then again, another clarifying question. On Risk Solutions, Greg, you mentioned I guess macro headwinds, macro concerns. Is this -- was your commentary directed towards just be HR business? Just towards Risk Solutions, or the entire corporation? Can you just expand a little as we think about the organic going forward, especially for Risk Solutions? That's where I'm most focused.
Gregory C. Case: Well, let's say on Risk solutions. I mean, there is, on Risk Solutions front, we've seen positive pricing trends for the last number of quarters as we saw -- as we described sort of from the GRIP analytics that have -- a healthy overall industry. Against that context, you have an economy that creates the headwinds that come against that around discretionary spend and then all the pieces in the context of that. We're not going to change our view. It's basically -- it remains fragile. We're going to work through it, we're going to grow organically in the context of it. But those are some the macro headwinds I was trying to describe. And then underlying that is just the capital buildup that continues to happen in the overall insurance industry, and we're always mindful of that. But as we said before, we have a name. We're going to grow organically. We're going to improve margins. We're going to increase earnings per share. And we're going to do it irrespective of the environment, and we expect to do that in Risk Solutions in 2013.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just one follow-up there, and I know you've talked about this in the past, but just can you remind us, in Risk Solutions, what's sort of your minimum organic that you need to grow the operating margins? Sounds like almost in any world, you think you can do it. But sort of how do we think about that sensitivity of whatever organic we come up with relative to your ability to drive the margins?
Christa Davies: Yes. I would give you 2 ways to think about this, Greg. The first is, in the depth of the economic recession where insurance rates were 5% to 10% down real, and we had declines in insured values which were a much bigger impact on the firm, the worst we saw in 2009 was minus 1% organic revenue growth. So the investments we're making allow us to sort of outgrow that. The other way, I guess, I would say is we have a natural, if you think about sort of the margin expansion, we have a natural inflationary portion in the expense base. So let's call that sort of 2%, that we need to sort of grow over to expand margins.
Operator: The next question is coming from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Quick follow-up on the exchange. So one of your competitors recently acquired an active exchange. So if we -- will the economics of your corporate exchange be similar to that one if we study the one that one that Towers Watson owns?
Gregory C. Case: Well, remember the Extend Health that, I believe you're talking about with Towers Watson, is a retiree exchange. So this is really analogous to our Aon Hewitt Navigators business. So we have had that in place for a number of years. And I said before, love the platform, love the progress that the teams made with it, and that continues to build and grow. And that would be more of a direct competitor from that standpoint. We then would separate an additional platform we have that doesn't exist anywhere else, and that's the corporate exchange. So this is 2 separate businesses, 2 separate initiatives we're taking sort of in the context of this, and building both of those businesses. And the corporate exchange, as I described before, is really the first of its kind. And it really is the first of its kind that addresses the great -- the pool I described, the 122 million-plus of active employee. So it's really 2 separate businesses.
Christa Davies: And in terms of the economics, I would say, obviously the Extend Health is a good proxy for our retirement exchange business. As we think about our corporate exchange business, it's leveraging the platform we already have in benefits administration, and we're selling to the same client base, and so we already have a scaled platform to operate that business.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Okay, I know you guys are doing, I think, a mini-teach-in on this in a month. So I will learn more there. Okay. Next on the pension. I was just curious. So given the drop in interest rates in both the U.S. and Europe this year, could your 2013 pension contribution cash flow projections change? And related, I know there's been a couple large corporate pension plans solution transactions announced recently. I think you guys were actually involved in the one with Verizon and Prudential. Is Aon exploring a solution as well for its pension deficit?
Christa Davies: So what I would say is we've taken steps already, over the last couple of years, to mitigate volatility in the size and risk of our pension plans. We've closed plans new entrants, we've frozen the benefits and we've derisked the impulsion of the plans. And I did note in my earlier comments that, on September 30, we made a move to aggregate 5 of the 7 Aon and legacy Hewitt plans into one plan in the U.K. And as a result of that, we've substantially decreased the costs of running those plans. And we made an additional contribution of $80 million that was discretionary. And so, our contributions in 2012 will be $641 million. And they will decline in 2013 despite the decline in discount rates in 2012. And the other thing I would note is that pension expense will also decline in 2013 as a result of the move we've made. Our pension plans are much less volatile, they're derisks. And if rates go lower potentially, there's also upside if they go higher.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. That make sense. In regards to a solution, is that something you guys always are thinking about? Kind of a...
Christa Davies: You should think we think of everything, and we look at everything.
Operator: The next question is coming from Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill.
Paul Newsome: The -- I missed what the description of the discrete benefits for the -- on the tax. Could you give us a little color on that? As well as could you talk about, prospectively, is the decline in the effective tax rate that we are looking at principally do the elimination of extraterritorial taxation or is there other stuff going on there as well?
Christa Davies: So as we think about the overall sort of effective tax rate and the decline from 29% at the beginning of calendar year 2012 to the 26% we've announced to Q4 2012 and going forward, we are making progress on the benefits of the move to the U.K. with that effective tax rate decline. We have an overall plan in place, and as we continue to execute on that plan and get more certainty on it, we'll continue to update you. With respect to the quarter and the tax rate from continuing operations, it's -- it declined to 23.2%, and that was a result of certain discrete tax adjustments, principally from our tax return in 2011. As you think about your model going forward, 26% is the right go forward rate.
Paul Newsome: Okay. And separately, I just -- more out of curiosity than anything, the cash restructuring payments that you talked about go out in as far as of 2015. What are the characteristics of those kind of cash restructuring charges that you'd see that far out from when you [indiscernible]
Christa Davies: Yes, it's mostly lease payment. As you think about restructuring leases and closing down activities, if you refer to sort of Page 11, it gives you those restructuring cash payments out over time. And it is mainly related to leases because the people costs happen fairly quickly.
Paul Newsome: And then finally, the $300 million in cash that was going to be freed up from the change in domicile, has that been moved up to the parent or we -- is that something, possibly in the future, we'll see...
Christa Davies: Yes, as -- we think about, as I said earlier, as one cash pool. And we access that, and we think about returning the returns on the cash pool maximized through return on capital, measured on a cash-on-cash basis. And we are disproportionately allocating it towards share buyback given we believe we're substantially undervalued, hence the 275 million of share buyback you saw in Q3, which is the most significant we've done in the quarter over the last 12 months.
Operator: No further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case: Well, thanks, Catherine. And I just want to say to everybody, thank you very much for your interest in Aon, and we look forward to the next quarterly call. Thanks very much.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded, and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
Gregory C. Case: Thank you, Emily, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. First, our performance against key metrics we communicated to shareholders; second, I'll cover overall organic growth performance; and third is continued areas of investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share. Turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 4% overall with solid growth across all major businesses in both Risk and HR Solutions. Operating margin decreased 100 basis points, driven primarily by significant investments we are making in new growth opportunities and in key talent across our businesses. Finally, EPS was $1.02 as growth and effective capital management primarily offset incremental investment spend. Overall, our second quarter results reflect improved organic revenue growth across all of our major businesses as we make significant investments to further strengthen our client-serving capabilities. Our results were also very consistent with the plants we laid out in Q1 for the full year 2012, recognizing that Risk Solutions was a bit better than anticipated and HR Solutions was a bit lighter than anticipated due to higher investment spend and the timing of certain deferred costs. While Christa will provide additional financial commentary in a few minutes, we continue to anticipate improved performance in the second half of the year are on track with our long-term targets and have continued to take significant steps to further position the firm for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 4% with growth across every major business. As market-related conditions continue to stabilize, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segments for long-term growth and leverage to an improving economy with management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction. New business generation of approximately $250 million across our Retail business with strong growth across many markets, including China, New Zealand, Benelux, France, U.S. Retail, Latin America and Affinity, just to name a few, highlighting the strength of our global client-serving capability; investments in new products and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP and Aon Broking globally; and in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 5 consecutive quarters. Reflecting on the individual businesses. In the Americas, organic revenue growth improved to 4% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Exposures were relatively stable and the impact from pricing was modestly positive, reflecting a continued modest pace of improvement from a year ago. We saw solid management of the renewal book portfolio in U.S. Retail and Affinity, strengthened by the continued rollout of Client Promise. We also saw solid new business growth in Latin America. Overall, results reflect strong performance, overcoming continued market weakness in certain areas such as the commercial construction sector. In International, organic revenue growth was 3% against pricing which was flat on average overall with firmer pricing in cat-exposed regions. We saw strong growth in New Zealand, across many regions in Asia and the emerging markets including double-digit growth in many areas such as China, Thailand, Hong Kong and New Zealand. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, macroeconomic conditions remain fragile across many core markets. However, with leadership positions across the U.K. and Europe, we saw strong retention rates and management of our renewal book portfolio would deliver modest growth overall, a solid performance given economic headwinds. In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth improved to 7% compared to a decline of 2% in the prior year quarter, a level of organic revenue performance not achieved since Q3 2006. Results primarily reflect strong new business growth in global treaty placements, a modest portion of which is nonrecurring revenue. The impact to the market from pricing was favorable in the near term, primarily due to property cat-exposed regions. The underlying strength of the book continues to improve as net new business won was positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. This level of performance and strength in new business generation continues to reflect Aon Benfield's value proposition for clients of strengthening their operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability. Turning to HR Solutions. Overall organic revenue growth improved to 4% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. We saw the rate of organic growth improve across both businesses despite weak discretionary spend globally and continued economic pressure in Continental Europe. Performance also reflects growth in areas where we're making significant investments in the business in areas such as HR BPO, investment consulting and pension risk management consulting. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's understanding of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risks continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations delivered at a local level, managing and transferring risk against pension plans that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. And finally, after working through the worst economic recession in the last 7 years, clients are just beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development and engagement to prepare themselves for renewed long-term growth. Turning to the individual businesses. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth improved to 6% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. We saw a strong growth in HR BPO from both new client wins and in discretionary products and services such as dependent eligibility audits. Results were partially offset by a decline in benefits administration as anticipated price compression and lower project-related revenue were greater than net client wins. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect increased demand for surveys and services in our Compensation Consulting Group; strong growth across our business in Asia, primarily for talent rewards; and strong demand for delegated pension risk management and investment consulting services. Results were partially offset by a decline in discretionary demand for actuarial services in core Retirement Consulting in Europe. Overall, in HR Solutions, we delivered solid organic revenue performance in the second quarter and are fully on track with previous expectations of delivering improved growth in both businesses in 2012. Our priorities for 2012 remains focused on driving growth, delivering improved profitability from our strategic investments and improving the growth profile in our core benefits administration and Retirement Consulting businesses. Slide 5 highlights the third topic, further areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include, in Risk Solutions: We're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the Revenue Engine internationally, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater client retention and rollover rates across our client base. We continue to invest in innovative technology such as GRIP, which is the world's leading global repository of risk and insurance placement information. We now have 1.5 million trades, more than $76 billion of bound premium and a growing client list of 25 insurance carriers utilizing the platform's analytics and service capabilities. We're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. Effective January 1, we aligned our global health and benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep Brokerage capabilities. Finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients, as well as adding key talent across Asia in specialty sectors and in our GRIP services business. In summary, as we've previously noted, we have proved the concept of these major investments in 2011. And as we move across 2012 and 2013, we're fully on track to drive greater scale and increase operating leverage. In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position in health care exchanges. Health care exchanges enable clients to begin the shift of their participants to a market-based defined contribution model for health care while addressing unsustainable health care cost increases and decreasing population health. As early as the fourth quarter, we plan to launch our first multi-carrier health exchange for active employees. We're expanding our Outsourcing offerings in high-growth areas such as dependent eligibility audits. We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology from large market to middle market. And we're developing new delegated solutions in investment consulting and pension risk management that leverage our total capabilities across advisory and delivery services. And finally, we're strengthening our international footprint to support a more global workforce with investments in key talent and capabilities across Asia and emerging markets. In summary, we delivered improved organic revenue growth across all of our major businesses in both Risk and HR Solutions, made significant strategic investments that will drive greater long-term growth and took important steps to strengthen our global firm. With that context, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review.
Christa Davies: Thanks very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our second quarter results reflect solid organic revenue growth and significant steps to strengthen our global firm. Our results, overall, are also in line with previous expectations provided in the first quarter. As our progress have measured over the course of the year, we continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve operating performance, deliver savings from our formal restructuring programs, generate strong free cash flow and effectively allocate capital as highlighted by the repurchase of 250 million of ordinary shares in the second quarter. Now let me turn to the financial results as highlighted on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, was $1.02 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.03 in the prior year quarter. Solid organic growth and effective capital management in the quarter was offset primarily by strategic investments to deliver increased long-term growth. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and $14 million of re-domicile costs, primarily for legal and advisory fees with a completed re-domicile on April 2. In addition, foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of $0.03 per share. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a modest unfavorable translation impact to EPS in both the third and fourth quarter of 2012. Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin increased 80 basis points to 21.9% and operating income increased 3% versus the prior year quarter. Included in operating income was a $17 million impact related to both unfavorable foreign currency translation and a decline in investment income from lower short-term interest rates globally. Solid organic revenue growth, restructuring savings and lower lease termination costs contributed to operating margin and operating income growth in the quarter, absorbing the significant investments we're making in our GRIP platform and in key talent across Asia and Latin America. Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding investments and long-term structural margin expansion. With respect to the Aon Benfield program, savings in the second quarter are estimated at $36 million compared to $30 million in the prior year quarter. The Aon Benfield program is expected to deliver cumulative expense savings of $146 million in 2012 compared to cumulative savings of $122 million in 2011. Further, associated with the transfer of the Health and Benefits business at January 1, an estimated $46 million of restructuring savings under the Aon Hewitt program will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $26 million of the $46 million in cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, including an estimated $8 million of incremental savings in the second quarter. A breakout of restructuring charges incurred in Risk Solutions associated with the Aon Hewitt program is detailed in the schedule on Page 13 of the press release. For the second half of 2012, operating margin is -- sorry, for the first half of 2012, operating margin is up 30 basis points and operating income is up 2%. For the second half of the year, operating income and margin are expected to be up. This is driven by operating income and margin down for the third quarter, driven by lower investment income, continued investment spend and normal seasonal weakness while the fourth quarter is expected to be up significantly, driven by less investment spend and normal seasonal strength. Therefore, Risk Solutions operating income and margin will be up for the first half, up for the second half and up for the full year as we discussed in the first quarter. Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%. Operating margin decreased 440 basis points to 15.4%. And operating income decreased 20% compared to the prior year quarter. Included was a $2 million or 20 basis point unfavorable impact from FX. Organic revenue growth of 4% and $15 million of incremental restructuring savings were more than offset by a $23 million or minus 250 basis point impact from significant investments in long-term growth initiatives, an unfavorable revenue mix as benefits administration and Retirement Consulting declined modestly, and a $9 million impact from deferred costs in Outsourcing related to the timing of large client implementations. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $11 million of charges in the quarter. Cumulative savings related to the formal restructuring program in the second quarter are estimated at $57 million compared to $34 million in the prior year quarter, of which approximately $8 million of the incremental savings were achieved in the Risk segment. As we discussed in the first quarter, we provided specific comments regarding the outlook for HR Solutions in 2012: number one, we expect improved organic growth in both businesses for 2012; number two, we would invest approximately $35 million in new growth opportunities, primarily in our health care exchanges, HR BPO, investment consulting and pension risk management; number three, approximately 75% of the restructuring savings would be realized in adjusted operating income; number four, expected performance would improve in the second half of the year as investment spend decreases in the second half from the first half. As we think about operating margin and income for the second half of the year, we now expect the third quarter to be relatively flat year-over-year compared to our previous expectation of down. And we expect the fourth quarter to be modestly up year-over-year compared to the previous expectations of flat in the fourth quarter. Our improved outlook for the second half reflects continued growth, low investment spend, less deferred project costs and additional synergy savings as we strengthen our industry-leading HR Solutions business for long-term operational excellence in 2013 and beyond. Turning to the next slide on our long-term operating margin targets. We continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve operating performance on an annual basis. While we've improved operating margins 500 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 26% for Risk Solutions reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 5 ways: Number one, deliver $33 million of remaining restructuring savings and other operational improvements. Number two, continued rollout of the revenue engine internationally. Number three, Aon Broking and GRIP-related initiatives. These 3 are fully within our control. In addition, there are 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant operating leverage based on improvements in the external market. Number four, increases in short-term interest rates. Number five, industry improvements, driving higher insured values or insurance pricing. Similarly, for HR Solutions, while we've improved operating margins nearly 1,200 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 22% reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 3 ways: number one, deliver $76 million of remaining restructuring savings after the transfer of savings to health and benefits; number two, growth in the core business and return on incremental investments; number three, improvement in the HR BPO business. Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on the next slide. Unallocated expenses increased $1 million to $34 million, excluding re-domicile costs. Interest income decreased $2 million due to lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances. Interest expense decreased $6 million due primarily to a decline in the average rate on total debt outstanding. Other income of $12 million included a gain due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, partially offset by losses on certain company-owned life insurance plans and long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million to $3 million per quarter of interest income, $35 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations increased to 27.5% in the second quarter compared to 24.7% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2011 was favorably impacted by the resolution of an income tax audit and certain deferred tax adjustments. The company continues to anticipate an effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations of approximately 28% in 2012. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 335.6 million in the second quarter compared to 342.7 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to the company share repurchase program. The company repurchased 5.3 million ordinary shares for approximately $250 million in the second quarter. Actual shares outstanding on June 30 were 322.4 million, and there are approximately 11 million dilutive equivalents. As part of a change in corporate domicile, Aon plc's Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program on April 19, 2012, that replaced the previously authorized share repurchase program by Aon Corporation's Board of Directors in January 2010. The company has approximately $4.75 billion of remaining authorization. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $802 million. And total debt outstanding was $4.5 billion. Overall debt-to-capital was 35.5% at June 30 compared to 35.7% at December 31. Cash flow from operations increased 8% to $284 million compared to $264 million in the prior year quarter. Despite a high organic growth rate, low working capital requirements more than offset an increase in cash taxes and cash contributions to the major pension plans in the quarter. Furthermore, we continue to operate with elevated levels of invoicing and cash collections, approximately $375 million related to a temporary delay in invoicing at Aon Hewitt, which began in the second half of 2011 with the conversion of certain orders to cash systems. We continue to make progress and expect this temporary increase to return to normalized levels by the end of 2012. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 2% to $226 million compared to $221 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in free cash flow reflects an 8% increase in cash from operations, partially offset by a $15 million increase in CapEx. Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to de-risk certain client assets. In 2011, we contributed approximately $477 million to our plans and would expect to contribute approximately $541 million in 2012 before any discretionary contributions. Higher contributions primarily reflect a decline in discount rates. We would expect contributions to decline annually beginning in 2013 despite a decline in discount rates year-to-date, resulting in fully funded plans on a GAAP basis in 2016. Regarding our restructuring plans. Cash payments were $178 million in 2011. As our restructuring plans continue to wind down, we would expect cash payments to decline $32 million to approximately $146 million in 2012 before declining further in 2013. As we continue to grow, improve operating performance and our required uses of cash decline over the next several years, we expect our strong free cash flow to be a significant source of value creation to shareholders. As an important step in unlocking that value for shareholders, on April 2, the company completed its change in jurisdiction of incorporation from Delaware to the U.K. We believe the transaction will help drive shareholder value through: number one, providing greater global access to expected increases in future free cash flow number two, enable us to access roughly $300 million of excess capital held internationally on our balance sheet; and number three, increase future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term, similar to what we've done over the last 5 years which was approximately 500 basis points. In summary, we are positioned for stronger growth in 2012, and we have significant leverage through an improving global economy. While we're investing to further strengthen our industry-leading portfolio, we are focused on 3 primary areas that will each contribute to substantially stronger free cash flow over the next several years: first is continuing growth and operating margin improvement towards our long-term targets; second, declining uses of cash for pensions and restructuring; third, greater capital flexibility and increased cash flow from a lower effective tax rate resulting from our re-domicile to the U.K. Combined with a strong balance sheet and greater financial flexibility, we have positioned the firm to effectively manage capital through the announced $5 billion share repurchase program and the recent increase in our annual dividend, highlighting our firm belief in the underlying value of Aon. With that, I'd like to hand the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Dan Farrell from Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just on the guidance on the Consulting margin. I mean you've laid out the case for how it improves through this year and next, but the guidance on the margin is clearly better than it was previously. Can you give a little more detail on what changed in the outlook if it's revenue driven or if there's less investment than you previously thought you had and maybe put more in this quarter? And then I just have a follow-up.
Christa Davies: Yes, and that's absolutely right, Dan. The guidance for HR Solutions margin in the second half of 2012 is improved from our previous guidance. So previously, we said we were down in Q3 and now we think we'll be flat year-over-year in Q3. And previously, we said we'd be flat in Q4, now we think we'd be up modestly in Q4. The 2 things really driving -- there are 3 things really driving that difference: one is less investment spend; two is less deferred costs; and three is improved restructuring savings. So they're sort of the 3 things that are just leading to that improvement from previous guidance.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Can you talk a little bit more about the level of ramp in revenue that we could see from these investments? Because obviously that's a key driver to getting these businesses ultimately to a normalized margin. And then, can you talk a little bit about how long you think it takes to get to that level where these are operating at a normal margin?
Christa Davies: Yes, so one of the things we would point out is that as we look at organic revenue growth in the HR Solutions segment in the first half of the year, it's the highest it's been in several years. So we are starting to see growth from these investments already. What I would observe as you look at the margin impact is, as these investments sort of ramp, you're getting revenue growth, which is slightly lower margin until the investments truly scale. And so as the revenue growth continues to come through and the investments scale, you'll see that become higher-margin revenue growth, if that makes sense.
Gregory C. Case: And I would just say, Dan, to add to that, is the one investment we have called out over the last couple of quarters is that on the health care exchanges, which we're very positive about. We feel like we've made a great progress in the context of that. As that comes online, it's going to take the next 2 to 3 years before you really start to see the full impact of what that can bring to us both on the retirement side and on the employee side. We're hopeful, by the way, in the fourth quarter we're going to be able to launch the first employee exchange to go with what we do on the retirement side. But it's going to take 2 to 3 years to really get those fully ramped up.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: In this quarter, how much of the $23 million is the health care exchanges? And correct me if I'm wrong, but there's 0 revenue right now on those investments, correct?
Christa Davies: It's limited. So the majority of the investments is health care exchange.
Gregory C. Case: But we are generating revenue on the retirement exchange. It's modest, but it is -- we do have clients. It's up and running. It's working very well and progressing just as we had hoped it would.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Walsh from Citi.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: First question, just on the Brokerage margins. If we adjust for the lease termination costs in 2Q '11, it seems margins were flattish, that we had 4% revenue growth. Can you just talk to -- is there an implied 4% expense run rate in the business going forward? And I've got a couple of follow-ups.
Christa Davies: Yes. So Keith, I think one of the things we really highlighted on Risk Solutions margin for the first half of the year, and we expect that to sort of to continue slightly into Q3, is we really are investing significantly in the GRIP platform and in talent in Latin America and Asia. And so what we're really seeing is that organic revenue growth is offsetting substantial investment spend. And what we did say in Risk Solutions is that margin's going to be up significantly in Q4 and therefore up for the full year. And so we're going to see a return on that significant investment in that GRIP platform and that talent within the year.
Gregory C. Case: So we talked about this quite substantially in the last call, Keith. From the standpoint of -- the investment, particularly on the GRIP rollout, is significant but it's also an investment unlike investment in -- classic investments in talent, which take a year or 2 to really come online. We see how the GRIP investment is going to actually pay back and that's why we have talked about improved margin in the year even with the investment we're making.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, very helpful. And then a question on HR, a couple. Just want to clarify something on the guidance, I guess, for 2012. It seems like -- has anything changed for your view of 2012? It just seems like maybe the investment's been front loaded a little bit. But overall, do you view 2012 differently than you did what you told us last quarter?
Christa Davies: I think that's fair, Keith. I think that's exactly right.
Gregory C. Case: And we're just seeing positive momentum, it continues to develop and we're just trying to reflect that.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. So no change there. And then just if you can just talk a little bit to the unfavor -- you mentioned, Christa, in your comments unfavorable revenue mix. Can you just help me understand that a little bit better. Is that more seasonality issue or is it a -- maybe some of the more profitable businesses of Hewitt declining since the deal has been done. Can you just talk to that a little bit?
Christa Davies: Yes, so what we would say is there is some unfavorable revenue mix in both benefits administration and in core Retirement Consulting as those high-margin businesses declined slightly. It's a very minor decline in revenue and we love the business and are continuing to invest in it long term.
Gregory C. Case: And we're just seeing really growth in some of the areas in HR BPO, in particular, in the exchanges which is just ramping up very, very well. And that really is the mix issue. We love this portfolio overall. We see lots of promise in terms of sort of where's it's going to go, in fact, more I would say even then when we actually brought on -- when we brought the 2 firms together, Keith. That's why we made -- we've made the investments and we're just seeing ramped -- we're seeing a greater ramp-up in some of the areas that are improving in margin a la our HR BPO and the exchanges, which are driving the revenue mix issues that Christa talked about.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Growth in Risk Solutions Americas obviously picked up nicely. If you have to the rank order between price and new business and exposure, how would you rank the drivers of that growth?
Gregory C. Case: Really, I would say, it's really across the board. We actually saw -- we saw movement on the pricing side and it's -- it was modest. It was not substantial. But we saw new business growth that was good; I think $250 million, overall, in new business as Christa highlighted. What we really also saw is continued management on the existing book and retention increases, particularly around some of the rollout of Client Promise and as we rolled it out across Europe and the rest of the world, we think we're going to see like increases when we actually get Client Promise and place it to really drive movement and retention. And we saw stability in insured values. So there wasn't a significant increase there, but it wasn't a decrease or a headwind as we've seen before.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And the same topic, on Europe, it sounds like you're still holding in okay. Are you worried that, that still can get worse from where it is right now?
Gregory C. Case: Well, listen, I think our colleagues really across the world just done a terrific job sort of on the client leadership front and certainly across Europe. Everyone is struggling, everyone is sort of fighting these set of headwinds, but I would reflect we grew. We had positive organic growth. It was modest, but we had positive organic growth. And we're continuing to put in place, as we've done in the U.S., some proven approaches that we think will really continue to help drive retention of that book. But we've got some just very privileged positions and platforms across the European theater and that's actually served us quite well. And so we're certainly concerned as we reflect on the impact of our clients. But so far, we've held our own. We just want to highlight, obviously there's a lot of potential headwind there and we're fighting through it. But we grew in the quarter and we've grown in the first half, and we're going to work hard on that for the second half.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Great. And one final question, also on organic. Both Reinsurance and Outsourcing blipped up. How much of that for this quarter is sort of more transactional in each segment? And again, is that potential -- again a little variation because of transactional business in each of those segments?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, I would separate the 2. They're very -- they're quite different. When you think about our Reinsurance business, it's 85% treaty is our overall business. And that's really the -- fundamentally, it was really new business generation that drove the bulk of that revenue growth. Two to 3 points was probably kind of onetime sorts of things, some price impact and some of the things that sort of drove that. But even if you took the 2 to 3 points out, it's actually a very substantial increase and really just a reflection of the great work that's being done on the Reinsurance side, really reflecting tremendous progress, new business wins that have really driven that business. So just really another quarter of progression for our reinsurance colleagues. Then on the Outsourcing side, really is -- remember, these are long-term contracts, multiyear contracts, and it just reflects wins on those contracts as those come online in the building of that business. And as Christa described before, the context of that, these are margin business, our businesses we're building margin on over time. And so that's why we had the revenue mix that Christa described, but just really -- they're just classic wins here. There's also about 10% of that, which is project revenue, which we've talked about before, we've been under pressure on and continue to face some headwinds on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I guess one big picture question and then a small one. Christa, you talked about being -- or really positioning the company to be more leveraged to an economic recovery. Would you have done anything differently over the past couple of years if you expected, let's say, 2 or 3 years of global economic weakness?
Christa Davies: Would I expect anything different? I mean, I think the big areas of upside, Meyer, really, are global interest rates. So 100 basis point increase in global interest rates has a sort of $35 million to $40 million impact on top line and bottom line. And I would observe on that dimension that interest rates did decline during Q2 and so we're seeing sort of weakness there. As we look at other areas of the global economy, as Greg said, exposures globally are roughly stable as we think about the underlying drivers of that, which are really corporate revenues, employment levels and asset values that's essentially stable. But look, the other key driver is inflation and we would say that if interest rates, underlying drivers of GDP or inflation were to improve, then we have a substantial leverage to all 3 of those.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, and there's -- Meyer, one of the -- I think you asked if we had done anything differently, as well if we'd anticipated it. And for us, remember, we build our game plan not anticipating substantial rate movement. We built our game plan not anticipating economic return. And we built our game plan to grow our business and to drive cash flow, which is really sort of the engine, which sort of -- which really what we believe is just continuing to build and well over time. And so for us, that game plan has been put together not anticipating a change in some of the headwinds. And so in many respects, the plan we've had in place will be the game plan we're going to go forward with. If we happen to get some benefits, as Christa described, that would be fantastic. But it doesn't change anything structurally that we put in place.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. Small question in HR Solutions. There's a $9 million increase in deferred costs. I was hoping you could explain what that is and how that plays out over the next few quarters?
Christa Davies: Yes, so it's really -- it's related to the timing of implementations on large outsourcing contracts and it has been a headwind in Q1 and Q2. We would expect that to reverse slightly in Q3 and Q4, hence, the improved guidance year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. It's literally just as we implement contracts and you have them go live, then you'd defer less of this expense.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Annizzi (sic) [Nannizzi] from Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes. So my question, I guess, is on Europe. I mean what are you assuming as a baseline for Europe in your revenue and margin guidance in just both segments, but in particular in the HR Solutions segment and just one follow-up.
Gregory C. Case: Well, as a baseline, we're assuming that's going to -- at this point, it's going to be flat overall in terms of sort of what's happened in the overall economy. It's obviously struggling and fragile. We're fighting against it. We've grown the business and we anticipate we're going to continue to do that, but it's going to be marginally positive going forward.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. So your baseline kind of the revenue guidance and margin guidance in HR Solutions is that you'll continue to grow not just outside of Europe, outside of the U.S. but also in Europe as well?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, that's what we've talked about, which is literally -- as we've said before, we got a set of game plans to add plans and add business to grow the business. We anticipate we're going to continue to do that. But we've highlighted that it's a struggle and it's a struggle for our clients, first and foremost, and a headwind for us. But we've been able to actually succeed against that and we anticipate doing it. But it's not going to be substantial at this point until things change.
Christa Davies: And the only other point I'd make is as you look at the seasonality of our business, Q1 is our strongest European quarter. And so while the second half of the year is certainly important, it's really Q1 next year that we'll be sort of focused on.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it, got you, great. And then one question on kind of capital generation, capital deployment. So you've deployed $250 million through the buyback this quarter. I mean, if you were -- is your expectation to deploy kind of what you're generating after the dividend, or should we think about deployment including more than that, given the additional cash that you have for the re-domicile or -- how should we think about where you plan to deploy from here?
Christa Davies: Yes, so the way we think about it, it's really as we generate free cash flow, we look at return on capital on a cash-on-cash basis to allocate any form of free cash flow. And we've said that we had approximately $100 million in Q1, $250 million in Q2 and we had really previously given guidance of $150 million per quarter with the potential of $300 million of additional purchases using excess capital from the balance sheet. Beyond that, it's not really in our best interest to provide specific guidance. And any uses of cash flow or excess capacity, including the $300 million of cash held internationally, will be evaluated and allocated based on the highest return on capital.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Locraft from Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just wanted to follow up on Europe. Could you just give us the percentage of total revs it is for each of the divisions? And then I guess you'd mentioned Q1 is the biggest for the HR business. So could you talk us through how big it is from a seasonality perspective? And really what I'm trying to get at, as others are as well, is sensitivity if things come in worse to the overall projections that you guys hope to achieve in the quarters and months and years ahead?
Christa Davies: Yes, so as we think about the business overall, about 15% of our overall revenue was Continental Europe. Risk is a little bit more; HR is a little bit less. As you think about patterning throughout the year, Q1's the biggest quarter. I mean I do sort of -- look, we're very sensitive to Europe, too. I would note and reinforce, as Greg described, we've grown in Europe in the first half of the year. We grew in Q2. We're very conservative in our future forecast, but it's not really the panic that everyone's currently worried about. We're certainly tracking it extremely carefully and we're managing what we observe is a fragile economy. But as Greg said, we have industry-leading positions in most large European countries and we're very proud of the performance that we're delivering.
Gregory C. Case: And remember, it's difficult to grow on these context, but clients need risk understanding. They need risk leadership. That absolutely can't go away. And in some respects, by the way, some of the issues in Europe actually magnify those issues and potentially create opportunities. And on the HR Solutions side, same token, everyone's got employees, everybody's got to work and support those employees and in times of need, sometimes those issues become even more acute. So we're by no means trying to say this is a positive. This a big headwind and a serious headwind for our clients. But we've got a lot of tools and a lot of approaches that we think serve us well in this context and we're going to keep applying those.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And just one follow-up on that. If we sort of go back to the financial crisis, '08 was a reasonable organic -- the world -- the financial markets came unglued in '08, but it wasn't really until '09 that you felt that in your organics in the HR business. How is this any different? Why is next year going to be a good year for Europe for HR Solutions given what we know today?
Gregory C. Case: Well, again, we've been careful to say -- we haven't said it's going to be a good year. We have essentially said we're going to continue to improve and build on our business. But I think you've highlighted something pretty profound. If you go back and look at 2008, as an example, and look at our business overall, as an example, and sort of our growth rates, even in the context of a very challenging 2008 and what's happened over time, the worst we did was negative 1% sort of across the board if you think about sort of our -- the robustness of our business in 2009. So against that backdrop, we held [ph] serve on growth. Our aspirations is to grow over time and we will do that. But just for background, that was the -- as you described, sort of, Greg, the worst of the worst. And from our standpoint, we think this is different in some ways and offer some opportunities that are a bit unique. I think I don't [ph] overstate it. This is going to be a challenge, continues to be a challenge. But as Christa described, we don't see this -- this is something we've, again, seen before and we're going to deal with and support our clients on it. We think AON will benefit from that.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Excellent. And one last one, just M&A. Just want to take your temperature on how you're feeling on that front. You were very explicit in cash plans, but I just wanted to ask what you're thinking now.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, if you just -- if you take Christa's foundation on the cash side, well, I think the clearest execution plan you can imagine, sort of M&As, from what Christa described, from our standpoint, we love the structure we've got. We've got -- the portfolio we have on HR Solutions and Risk Solutions that we like a lot. We'll always add to that from a standpoint of smaller tuck-in acquisitions and have historically spent $200 million to $300 million a year sort of in that context on things that truly add content and capability or geographic reach. That really is the extent of our M&A aspirations at this point. We love the platform we've got.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple of quick questions here for you. The first one, on the Outsourcing business, I wonder if you could talk about -- is the growth you're seeing there from just underlying employee growth or is it some of the special projects that you had stopped seeing back in 2011 that all of a sudden starting to come through?
Gregory C. Case: Really, Brian, this is really new client wins and as we bring on those new client wins, particularly around HR BPO and on some of the comp consulting side, it really is -- that's really where you're seeing a reflection of. Just fundamental strength in the core part of the business. And we have not seen the discretionary spend pick up. So that 10% of the project spend, that's been a pressure -- we continue to see as a pressure where you're really seeing all this rollout of new clients.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, great. And then next question, on the health exchanges. Do you have any new clients and how many clients have you kind of signed on so far? And kind of what are the enrollments looking like?
Gregory C. Case: Well, again, remember there are 2 types of exchanges here. One is on the retirement side and we have an active exchange up and running, multiple clients in the context of that and many lies in the context sort of what we're doing in that. We're going to go through another roller period coming up, so that's an active exchange, which we're investing behind, which we're building on. And then we're very hopeful to actually launch what would be the first active employee exchange coming up in the fourth quarter of this year. And in many respects, we've got clients who are excited about that, markets who are excited about that and look forward to doing that, which means we would have 2 exchanges in place, a retirement exchange and an employee -- active employee exchange, both of which would be, as Christa described before, growth engines for us and opportunities to really build our business. So we're excited about both of them.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then when should we potentially see that in the revenue numbers?
Gregory C. Case: Well, you're going to start to see -- you'll begin to see it meaningfully in the revenue numbers, as I said before, really into '13, but really in the '13 and '14. You'll start to see it really in the profit numbers a bit after that, I'd said 2 to 3 years, thus far. But that's kind of the overall profile.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then just overall on the pricing environment for property/casualty insurance, your thoughts there, and what impact is that having on your revenue growth, organic revenue growth?
Gregory C. Case: Well, sort of back overall on pricing again. On the retail side, we draw [ph] directly and specifically from the Global Risk Insight Platform. As we said before, we see continued improvement just for numbers if it's helpful. Q2 -- go back to last year, Q2 '11, we were minus 3%. Q3, we were minus 2%. Q4, we were roughly flat. And in the first quarter, we're kind of plus 1%. That's roughly where we are now, give or take. So on the Retail side -- so it's positive. It's trended positive. You can start -- it seems like that's beginning to flatten out a bit in terms of where we are. And really, you're going to have to split that between new and renewal. We're looking at both overall here as that's where we capture [ph] GRIP. And then on the Reinsurance side, we also saw a positive -- marginal positive movement sort of in that and that's reflected in the numbers, as I've said before, kind of a couple of points as it related to our book. But if you look at the global reinsurance capital, it's a story you know well, Brian. We ended 2011 about $455 billion in capital, which was down 3% from 2010 from $470 billion. By the way, that absorbed over $100 billion worth of insured losses. But if you look at the first quarter of 2012, we're back up to $470 billion. So in terms of some overall pressure, there are still kind of back to almost unprecedented levels of capital in the overall business at this point in time. So for us, it's been positive. It's had an impact. But when you think about kind of where we are, you start to see that flatten out a little bit. So marginally positive to flattening out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I want to touch base on a couple of items: first, on the Reinsurance organic revenue growth. Do you expect that trend of improving organic revenue growth to continue in 3Q?
Gregory C. Case: Yes. When we said, Jay, overall -- first of all, we're just pleased with the progress overall, the fundamentals of the business around sort of wins, new wins, net new wins, and that's now been positive for 5 consecutive quarters, just as we expected it would be once sort of the overall set of adjustments are made when we brought the 2 firms together. The 7%, I said before, kind of had 200 to 300 basis points of pricing, which is leveling out some kind of onetime discretionary spends, which we think will probably go away. But so you back that out, you're kind of still at the 4% to 5% range and we see that kind of progress over the course of the year.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. On the -- Christa, can you update us on the progress in improving the effective tax rate with the corporate move?
Christa Davies: So Jay, we did say that the tax rate for the full year is going to remain 28%. We did observe that the tax rate in the quarter, 27.5%, and so we continue to see the tax rate being 28%. I would observe that's down 100 basis points from the 29% we had at the beginning of the year. And as we think about the move to the U.K., we have said that we expect a substantial reduction of global effective tax rate, approximately 500 basis points over the long term.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right, okay. And then on the Risk Solutions where you just talked about the improving margins, I just wanted to confirm that, that also means improving adjusted operating profit?
Christa Davies: Yes, that's right.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. So can you help us -- so I guess that would mean improving revenue year-over-year as well?
Christa Davies: We definitely think organic revenue growth is going to be positive.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann from JPMorgan.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So a couple -- first, numbers questions. Just the $23 million of incremental investment spend you highlighted in the Consulting segment, can you break that up between comp and benefits and other expenses?
Christa Davies: No, we can't. But what we can say is that the majority of it is related to health care exchanges.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Any just qualitative comment on how to allocate it?
Christa Davies: Yes, as we think about what it is, it is people and it's technology. And the technology spend is both an ongoing expense and it's capital expenditure. So as you think about scaling up a health care exchange, a lot of it's about hiring people to process the placement and some of them are very experienced people, like brokers. Some of them are administrative people to place the business and then as a substantial investment in the technology platform to scale the business to the large clients that we're going to be scaling over the next couple of years.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: But as we think about that ongoing administrative or people expenses aren't likely to be called out as investments, so is it fair to think about that as either CapEx or any consulting on the -- any internal consultants or what-have-you on the implementation side?
Christa Davies: That is right. So we would say from 2013 onwards, we will absorb that in the business.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. Then just curious, one of the things you talked about when you originally acquired Hewitt was some of the cross-selling opportunities between Risk Solutions and HR Solutions. And it feels like now that the office managers, regional managers kind of have their marching orders and that's a priority. Any early returns on that front?
Gregory C. Case: Let's start with one of the things that we saw enough promise and we actually -- we talked about some of the alignment around health and benefits. We've actually moved the entire Health and Benefits business, so $721 million for the revenue or thereabouts, from Aon Hewitt over to Aon Risk Solutions sort of in the context of that and saw a very strong growth sort of in the quarter as a result of that. So if one wanted kind of a very explicit underpinning sort of talk's cheap or what action are you taking, there is very specific action that we took based on early returns that we saw that we think are really beginning to have impact on the business but will have much, much more impact over time as we sort of take the capability we've got sort of in the context of where we are and deliver some of the Hewitt capability into the Risk client base and also in the middle market, so we're seeing that quite substantially and that's one example. What I'd also say on the health care exchanges, one of the investments if you think about it, we're involved in the design of those but also there's this [indiscernible] Brokerage involved in that and administration. So very directly, we're kind of connecting in terms of overall capabilities to serve our clients. So we would say, Matthew, there's a lot of connection and it is, at least, are more than we anticipated coming into the overall merger and early returns are very good in terms of sort what we're doing, but they're early. We've got a long way to go and we're continuing to build, but feel good about the progress.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: How, from an external perspective over the next couple of years, you think we should -- how should we think about where we're going to see those benefits show up? I think you highlighted the easiest ones to get your arm around on the business that was transferred in the Brokerage, but how should we monitor that?
Gregory C. Case: Well, think you're going to look at -- you're going to see growth across the board. In many respects, you're going to hopefully see growth sort of in the Aon Hewitt side x Health and Benefits. Literally, what we're doing -- you just think about the capability we've got on the Outsourcing side, the delivery capability we've got. If you imagine that in the middle market, I mean think about it, Hewitt before was much more a U.S.- and U.K.-focused company, had certainly operations around the world. But Aon exceptionally strong around the world, incredibly strong little markets, so great capability in the context of that. And it also, as you sort of move up market, the Hewitt capability sort of in the large corporate arena was just extraordinary. So bringing risk capability to there we think could be very positive. The exchanges we've talked about before. So from our standpoint, we actually see connectivity across the business. We think you're going to see results sort of in multiple places.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And that's something that the mid-market, the large global yang, yang, yang depending on the segment we're talking about, that's something you all -- we can expect you to call out?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, I think -- call out -- I don't know if we're going to sort of explicitly say this exactly was driven by client enrollment.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, I just meant qualitatively in the press release, that kind of thing.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, sure.
Operator: And our last question comes from Alex Lopez from Portales Partners.
Alex lopez - Portales Partners, LLC: Greg, I just want to -- I actually have a couple of follow-up questions on pricing and then I have a quick question on capital management. Greg, I just want to confirm, did you mention that about 2 to 3 points of the 7% Aon Benfield organic growth that [ph] contributed to pricing, is that right?
Gregory C. Case: Yes. What I said there are couple of things there. One was pricing, which was marginally positive. And then there are a couple of kind of one-off sort of additions, just really adjustments we made on behalf of clients that have impacted the quarter. So I really said there was 2 to 3 points overall that included pricing as part of it.
Alex lopez - Portales Partners, LLC: Okay. So there's a one-off. That's the nonrecurring or favorable pricing impact, right?
Gregory C. Case: Correct.
Alex lopez - Portales Partners, LLC: Also, can you provide some color on the pricing environment in Aon Hewitt. We have some idea of the demand, but the pricing. I was wondering if you can talk about that?
Christa Davies: So the pricing environment, we would say, particularly on the Outsourcing side, remains very competitive. And it is absolutely a headwind we faced, it's negative. It has remained at a consistent negative level since we merged with Hewitt in 2010. And we would say it's exactly in line with our expectations that we modeled when we acquired the company. So it remains very consistent.
Gregory C. Case: I think from a competitive standpoint, all of our businesses are competitive. All of them are -- sort of have prices sort of as one aspect of it. We continue to compete on value, which is helping our clients understand what we can do to help improve their operating performance or reduce their volatility or strengthen the balance sheets or really just help them improve performance. And that's actually served us well on the Reinsurance side, on the Retail side and in Aon Hewitt.
Alex lopez - Portales Partners, LLC: So it's competitive in Outsourcing and somewhat negative on the Consulting practices within Aon Hewitt, is that positive, competitive or...
Christa Davies: Yes.
Gregory C. Case: I still think it's like the business has been over time, there's lots of competition, lots of competitors out there sort of talking to clients. What we believe we've got is, Alex, a very unique way to sort of talk about the value we can bring to the market and whether it's on the advice side, on the consulting side or it's on the delivery side. And what we do on the outsourcing side, we think we've got a very unique platform in which we can actually offer our client not only the diagnosis and sort of help understand what to do but also and how to do it and actually do it for them on the outsourcing side. So we think the platform called Aon Hewitt is actually quite unique in the context of the HR Solutions world, just like we believe the risk solutions platform we have with Aon Risk Solutions and Aon Benfield is very unique.
Alex lopez - Portales Partners, LLC: Okay, great. Christa, quick question on capital management. Can you remind us how much senior debt is maturing in Q4? I think you had a little bit. And any thoughts on managing that or what were you going to do with it?
Christa Davies: Yes. So we have, in December 2012, about $225 million of debt that comes up for renewal. You should expect us to renew that as we normally do it.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case: I just want to say thanks to everybody for joining the call this quarter. We appreciate it and look forward to discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it's important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website.  Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc. Sir, you may begin.
Gregory C. Case: Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review and would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.  First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. And third is continued areas of investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share.  Turning to Slide 3, in the first quarter, organic revenue was 4% overall, reflecting the strongest rate of organic revenue growth since the second quarter of 2007 and the strength of our industry-leading platform. Operating margin decreased 80 basis points, driven primarily by significant investments we're making across our businesses to increase long-term growth. Finally, EPS was $0.98, including $0.06 of unfavorable impact from foreign currency.  Overall, our first quarter performance reflects improved organic revenue growth across our businesses as foreign currency movement and significant investments to drive greater long-term growth had an unfavorable impact on bottom line results. While we're not satisfied with margin improvement and working capital management in the near term, we fully anticipate improved performance in the second half of the year, are on track with our long-term targets and have completed significant steps to position the firm for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility, as highlighted by the completed redomestication to London in early April.  Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 4% with growth across every major business. As market-related conditions continue to stabilize, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and leverage to an improving economy. With management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction.  New business generation of over $220 million across our Retail Business, with strong growth across many markets including China, Latin America, Italy and New Zealand, just to name a few, highlighting the strength of our global client-serving capability. Investments in new product and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP and Aon Broking globally and in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 4 consecutive quarters.  Reflecting on the individual businesses. In the Americas, organic revenue growth improved to 4% as the impact from pricing and exposures are relatively flat, reflecting a continued modest pace of improvement from a year ago. We saw strong management of the renewal book portfolio across all regions, strengthened by the continued rollout of Client Promise. We saw solid new business growth in Latin America. Results reflect strong performance, overcoming continued market weakness in the commercial construction sector.  In international. Organic revenue growth improved to 4% against pricing, which was flat to modestly down on average overall, including firmer pricing in catastrophe-exposed regions. We saw strong growth in New Zealand, across many regions in Asia and in emerging markets, including double-digit growth in many areas such as China, Taiwan and Italy. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, market conditions remained soft and macroeconomic conditions remained fragile across many core markets. With leadership positions across the U.K. and Europe, we saw strong retention rates and the management of the renewal book portfolio led to modest growth across almost every region, a solid performance given industry and economic headwinds.  In reinsurance, organic revenue growth improved to 5%, a level of organic revenue performance not achieved since Q3 2006. Results primarily reflect strong new business growth in global treaty placements. The impact of the market from pricing internationally was modestly favorable, partially offset by higher cedent retentions as clients retain more risk. The underlying strength of the book continues to improve as net new business won was positive for the fourth consecutive quarter. This level of performance and the strength of new business generation continues to reflect the Aon Benfield's value proposition for clients of strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability.  Turning to HR Solutions. Overall organic revenue growth improved to 3% compared to minus 1% in the prior year quarter. We saw a growth across both businesses despite weak discretionary spend globally and continued economic pressure in Continental Europe. Performance primarily reflects strong growth in areas where we're making significant investments in the business. In areas such as HR BPO, investment consulting, pension risk management consulting and health care exchanges. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's deep understanding of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients, such as health care costs and associated financial risks that will continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving.  The clients are increasingly looking for a global benefit solution that support global organizations at a local level, managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. And last, after working through the worst economic recession in the last 70 years, clients are beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development and engagement, to prepare themselves for renewed long-term growth.  Turning to the individual HR Solutions businesses. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth improved to 3% compared to minus 3% in the prior quarter. We saw a growth from both new client wins in HR BPO, Absence Management and from the investments in our health care exchange business. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in Benefits Administration as client wins were offset by anticipated price compression and client losses within expectations.  In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth is 1% compared to 2% in the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth across our businesses in Asia. Increased demand for surveys and services in our Compensation Consulting Group and strong demand for delegated pension risk management and investment consulting services. Results were partially offset by a decline in discretionary demand for actuarial services in our core Retirement Consulting business.  Overall, in HR Solutions, we're pleased with our organic revenue performance in the first quarter and are on track with previous expectations for delivering improved growth in both businesses in 2012. And while encouraged that we're beginning to deliver results from the investments we are making in new growth opportunities, our priorities for 2012 remained focused on delivering improved profitability from these investments and improving the growth profile in our core business administration and Retirement Consulting businesses.  Slide 5 highlights the third topic, further areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance combined with expense discipline and strong cash flow continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capability around the globe. A few examples include, in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the revenue engine internationally, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates across our client base.  We continue to invest in innovative technology such as GRIP, which is the world's leading global repository of risk and insurance placement information. We now have 1.4 million trades, more than $75 billion of down premium and a growing client list of 25 insurance carriers utilizing the platform's analytics and services capabilities.  We're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and the facilities into the market on behalf of clients. Effective January 1, we aligned our global Health and Benefits platform to broaden our global distribution channel and strengthen these deep brokerage capabilities.  And finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients, as well as adding key talent across Asia and Latin America in specialty sectors and in our GRIP Services business.  In summary, as we have noted previously, we have proved the concept of these major investments in 2011. As we move across 2012 and 2013, we will drive greater scale and increase operating leverage.  In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our leading position in health care exchanges, enabling clients to begin the shift of their participants to a market-based defined contribution model for health care. Later this year, we plan to launch our first multi-carrier health exchange for active employees.  We're expanding our outsourcing offerings in high-growth areas, such as dependent eligibility audits and absence management. We continue to expand our industry-leading Benefits Administration platform from large market to middle market. We're developing new delegated solutions in investment consulting and pension risk management that leverage our total capabilities across advisory and delivery services. And finally, we're increasing our international footprint to support a global workforce, with investments in key talent and capabilities across Asia and emerging markets.  In summary, we delivered improved organic growth across both Risk and HR Solutions, made significant investments that will drive greater long-term growth and took important steps to strengthen our global firm. With that said, I'm pleased now to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect improved organic revenue growth across both segments, resulting in the highest level of organic growth in the last 15 quarters. While we are not satisfied with margin performance and working capital management, we continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve operating performance, deliver savings from our formal restructuring programs, generate strong cash flow and effectively allocate capital as highlighted by the repurchase of $100 million of common stock in the first quarter.  Now let me turn to the financial results as highlighted on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, was $0.98 per share for the first quarter compared to $0.99 in the prior year quarter. Strong organic growth and effective capital management in the quarter was offset by unfavorable foreign currency movement and investments to deliver increased long-term growth. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release, include noncash intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges related to the formal restructuring programs and $3 million of headquarter relocation costs.  In addition, there were 2 unfavorable foreign currency impacts not adjusted for, but it's helpful in understanding the core results. First, the company recognized an $18 million pretax or $0.04 per share loss due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional reporting currencies. Secondly, foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of $0.02 per share. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a modest unfavorable translation impact to EPS in the second quarter of 2012.  Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 4%. Operating income increased 2% and operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 21.4%. Excluding the $8 million impact of FX in the quarter, operating income increased 4% and operating margin was essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter. Solid organic revenue growth, restructuring savings and lower lease termination costs contributed to operating income growth, but operating margin improvement was offset by significant investments in key talent across Asia and in our GRIP platform, as well as $11 million of costs or a 60 basis point unfavorable impact related to both the integration of Glenrand and to certain project-related work in Australia. We would expect these costs and investments to have a modest impact in Q2 and Q3.  Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. With respect to the Aon Benfield restructuring program, we incurred $8 million of charges in the first quarter. The company has closed and completed all restructuring activities and incurred 100% of the total charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings. Restructuring savings in the first quarter are estimated at $34 million compared to $29 million in the prior year quarter. The Aon Benfield restructuring program is expected to deliver cumulative expense savings of $146 million in 2012, compared to cumulative savings of $122 million in 2011.  Further, associated with the transfer of the Health and Benefits business at January 1, 2012, an estimated $46 million of restructuring savings under the Aon Hewitt restructuring program will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $18 million of the $46 million in cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, including an estimated $18 million of savings in the first quarter. A breakout of restructuring charges incurred in Risk Solutions associated with the Aon Hewitt restructuring program is detailed in the schedule on Page 13 of the press release.  As Greg noted in his commentary, we are not satisfied with flat margin performance in the first quarter. As we think about the remainder of the year, we would expect a similar performance in Q2 and Q3. Through return on our investments, remaining restructuring savings and lower integration costs, we would expect a strong Q4 resulting in Risk Solutions margin improvement for the full year 2012, and continued margin improvement towards our long-term target of 26%.  Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating income decreased 7% and operating margin decreased 180 basis points to 16.5% compared to the prior-year quarter. Included was a $1 million or 10 basis point unfavorable impact from FX. Organic revenue growth of 3% and $26 million of incremental restructuring and synergy savings were more than offset by $20 million or a minus 210 basis point impact from significant investments in long-term growth initiatives, an unfavorable revenue mix shift as core Benefits Administration and Retirement Consulting declined modestly and a $13 million impact from deferred costs in Outsourcing related to the timing of large client implementations.  With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $9 million of charges in the quarter. Cumulative savings related to the restructuring program in the first quarter are estimated at $40 million compared to $24 million in the prior-year quarter, with additional synergy savings of approximately $29 million achieved outside of the formal restructuring program compared to $19 million in the prior-year quarter.  As we noted in the fourth quarter, we provided specific comments regarding the outlook for the HR business in 2012. Number one, we expect improved organic growth in both businesses for 2012. Number two, we would invest approximately $35 million in new growth opportunities, primarily our health care exchanges, HR BPO, investment Consulting and pension risk management. Number three, approximately 75% of the restructuring savings will be realized in adjusted operating income.  Number four, expected performance will improve in the second half of the year as investment spend decreases in the second half from the first half. And lastly, for the full year, with the transfer of an additional $26 million of savings to the Risk segment related to Health and Benefits, and a more conservative view on discretionary spend for project-related revenue, we would now expect operating income to be down modestly year-over-year, with Q2 and Q3 down from the prior-year quarter and flat in Q4 before growing in 2013.  While we are not satisfied with our results in the first quarter, we are focused on delivering against our objectives we laid out for the full year. And we'll continue to push against each of these objectives every quarter as we strengthen our industry-leading HR Solutions business for long-term operational excellence going forward.  Turning to the next slide on our long-term operating margin targets. We continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve operating performance on an annual basis. While we've improved operating margins 500 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 26% for Risk Solutions reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 5 ways: Number one, deliver $47 million of remaining restructuring savings and deliver other operational improvements. Number two, continued rollout of the revenue engine globally.  Number three, Aon Broking and GRIP-related initiatives. These 3 are fully within our control. In addition, there are 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant leverage based on improvements in external market. Number four, increase in short-term interest rates. Number five, industry improvements driving high-insured values or insurance pricing.  Similarly, for HR Solutions, while we've improved operating margins 1,200 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 22% reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 3 ways: Number one, deliver $91 million of remaining restructuring savings after the transfer of savings to Health and Benefits. Number two, growth in core business and return on incremental investments. Number three, improvement in HR BPO.  Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on the next slide. Unallocated expenses increased $2 million to $34 million, excluding headquarter relocation costs. Interest income decreased $3 million due to lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances. Interest expense decreased $4 million to $59 million due primarily to a decline in the average rate on total debt outstanding. Other income included an $18 million loss due to an unfavorable impact of exchange rates on remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, offset by a gain on certain company-owned life insurance plans and distributions from certain private equity securities.  Going forward, we continue to expect a run rate of approximately $3 million to $5 million per quarter of interest income, $35 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter.  Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations declined to 28% in the first quarter compared to 29% due primarily to changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain deferred tax adjustments. We would anticipate an effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations of 28% for 2012.  Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 336.6 million in the first quarter compared to 345.4 million in the prior-year quarter due primarily to the company's share repurchase program. The company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $100 million in the first quarter. Actual common shares outstanding on March 31 were 326.4 million and there are approximately 11 million diluted stock equivalents.  Subsequent to the close of the first quarter, in connection with the completed change in corporate domicile, the Aon plc Board of Directors announced the authorization of a $5 billion share repurchase program, which replaced and canceled the previously authorized program by the board of Aon Corporation.  Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $833 million and total debt outstanding was $4.5 billion. Overall debt-to-capital was 34.8% at March 31, compared to 35.7% at December 31. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was a use of $15 million, compared to a source of $155 million in the prior-year quarter. While the first quarter is historically our seasonally weakest quarter from a cash flow perspective, due primarily to incentive compensation, there are several key impacts I'd like to highlight. First, included is a use of $118 million as Hewitt colleagues were transitioned from a September fiscal year end to Aon's calendar year-end incentive compensation cycle. Effectively creating a 15-month payout for 2011 in 2012.  Second, cash pension contributions, net of expense, increased $31 million compared to the prior year. And lastly, we continue to operate with elevated levels of invoicing and cash collections, approximately $400 million, related to a temporary delay in invoicing in Aon Hewitt, which began in the second half of 2011 with the conversion of certain audited cash systems. We are making progress and expect this temporary increase to return to normalized levels by the end of 2012.  Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, was negative $86 million, down from $99 million in the prior year due primarily to lower cash from operations and a $15 million increase in CapEx year-over-year.  Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and derisked certain client assets.  In 2011, we contributed approximately $477 million to our plans and would expect to contribute approximately $541 million in 2012 before any discretionary contributions. Higher contributions primarily reflect the decline in discount rates. We would expect contributions to decline annually beginning in 2013, resulting in fully funded plans on a GAAP basis in 2016.  Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were $178 million in 2011. Our restructuring plans continue to wind down. We would expect cash payments to decline $31 million to approximately $147 million in 2012 before declining further in 2013.  As we continue to grow, improving operating performance and our required uses of cash decline over the next several years, we expect our strong free cash flow growth to be a significant source of value creation for shareholders. As an important step in unlocking that value for shareholders, on April 2, the company completed its change in jurisdiction of incorporation from Delaware to the U.K. We believe the transaction will help drive shareholder value through, number one, providing greater global access to expected increases in future free cash flow; number two, enable us to access approximately $300 million of excess capital held internationally on our balance sheet; and number three, increase future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term.  In summary, we are positioned for stronger growth in 2012. We have significant leverage through an improving global economy. While we are investing to further strengthen our industry-leading portfolio, we have significant opportunities to continued long-term margin improvement. Our balance sheet and strong cash flow will continue to provide significant financial flexibility. And lastly, we've positioned the firm to effectively manage capital through the announced $5 billion share repurchase program and the recent increase in our annual dividend, highlighting our firm belief in the underlying value of Aon.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Dan Farrell, Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Can you talk a little bit more about the margin? I think, obviously, coming in a bit lower than I would've thought. And there's quite a bit of reinvestment going on in the business. And while it's a constant practice to reinvest, it seems that it's running at a higher turn. I guess, talk about how much longer you think that goes on. And then maybe expand a bit more on the revenue opportunities and put maybe some numbers around where you think that starts to ramp and give you benefits.
Gregory C. Case: Well, I appreciate the question. I think the area of investment is obviously an important one for the quarter and really for the next few quarters. As Christa described, it's important you really do understand what we're ramping up in 2012. And if you step back and think about what we are accomplishing with our investments, what we've done with the Aon Broking investment around GRIP and the overall GRIP platform, we believe is actually quite unique. I do want to emphasize, as Christa described, our view is, the Risk Solutions margin will be positive in 2012. So in the end, when we think about these investments in the trade-offs, as we look at margin overall, we look at it on a year-to-year basis. And this is going to get reflected in this year. But step back and think about what we try to accomplish, we want to grow organically, increase margins, increase earnings per share. And we're not just focused on individual quarters. We're going to focus on the year overall, and we are going to take steps to improve the foundation of Aon to the extent we think it can improve operating leverage. These are the kinds of investments we have been making. There have been a number that have been on the traditional side that largely the entire industry has been doing around adding talent. We continue to do that, too. That's affected the quarter. Those will pay off over time. But what's different about this quarter is a specific decision we made for 2012 to ramp up Aon Broking and to ramp up what we're doing with overall GRIP. And this is a very important question. When you think about what we've done, we talked about GRIP, really, for the last couple of years. And what we needed to do, first of all, is understand our flow. So $60 billion plus of flow around the world. We needed to do the analytics behind it, drove that -- by the way, that investment got no monetization, so we didn't get a lot of benefit out of that. Then we had to actually introduce that to our clients around the world and our markets to really prove the concept. And on this call and some individual conversations, we talked about proving concept of GRIP and Aon Broking in 2011. And we believe we've absolutely done that. We've got 25-plus carriers who have actually come online and actually are making use of the data. We've been able to actually launch a D&O program last summer that proves what we can do on behalf of clients. So Dan, we've made specific steps to truly prove the concept around what we've done with Aon Broking. And now, what we're doing is we've decided we're going scale it. And scale up means we're going to make additional investments in technology. By the way, we're going to add the entire Health and Benefits flow, which is another $24 billion of flow. We're adding some geographies. We're making it more automated and we're putting people around it. So we've actually got dedicated teams who are representing the carriers as they come online. So each of the 25 carriers, we've got various versions of dedicated teams that help them do what they need to do, to actually better match their capital with our clients. And the reason I'm taking a bit of time to make the point is, this is a fundamental difference in the type of investment that I think has been made across the industry. We believe is very substantial for Aon and that it improves our operating leverage, but it also strengthens our client-serving capability. In many respects, if you think about what we were able to accomplish in 2011, we got quite excited about what we were able to pull together and realize that in our order to actually roll that out, we needed to ramp up. And that's, if fact, what we've done. It's important again -- a lot of times when people actually bring people online or brokers online, they're talking about a multiyear payback. We know what this payback looks like. We know what the pipeline is, we know the revenue potential, we know the cost to ramp up and support. By the way, we know there's going to be headwind as we ramp up, but we also know in the context of that there will be positive margin for the year. And what we're going to have in the end, is we're going to have positive margin, but we're also going to have a platform in place that is best-in-class around data and analytics with now over $80 billion of flow. We've got revenues from carriers, who get great value to serve our clients. And we're going to get higher yield per dollar premium play. So for us, this is an opportunity to ramp up something that we've actually been working on for quite some time, and you'll see benefit in year. We could basically absorb the kind of proof phase of this, if you will, for the last couple of years, but we're not going to be able to absorb the ramp-up piece. But we're quite confident about what the overall benefit's going to look like for us and what it's going to mean for you. So that's the difference.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just one quick follow-up on the Consulting side and the amount of investment going in there. Can you put a number around the revenue opportunity from the health care exchanges that you're making investment in because, obviously, there's probably not much, if any, revenue yet?
Gregory C. Case: Well, I'd say and I would contrast, by the way, you asked the question quite appropriately on investments. What we just described on GRIP is different than what we're doing from the health care exchange stand point. That's actually got a bit more of a lead time. We're putting in place a whole series of things that actually will launch these exchanges, both looking at the corporate side and on the retirement side. And so it's going to take a bit more time, but we see this as a fundamental opportunity. This, again, if you think about what's different around Aon Hewitt from when we actually brought the firms together, one of them is a very explicit decision to invest the better part of $75 million over the course of the couple of years in these exchange arenas, which we think are going to be quite beneficial for our clients and quite beneficial for our shareholders over time. But the lead time is going to be longer.
Christa Davies: And in terms of the revenue, Dan, I mean we will see revenue in this year on the retiree exchange and the corporate exchange will sort of ramp up. But we see the return on this investment being one of the highest across the business, which is why we've made such a large investment.
Operator: Next question, Ray Iardella, Macquarie.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: A couple of questions here. I guess first, maybe you can talk about a little bit about investments in people. I think you guys have called out key investments in talent in the past couple of releases. And certainly, you know with some of the initiatives like GRIP, you certainly need additional talent. And I know you pointed to Asia on the Brokerage side. But when does that translate, I guess, the talent translate into more revenue growth?
Gregory C. Case: Well, so a couple of aspects on that. As you think about -- we've been investing in talent, and we'll continue to do so, over time, particularly as described in Asia and Latin America and the high-growth areas around the world. And we see opportunity with the talent investments on this coming end of 2012 and in 2013. But I want to contrast that with the people investment we're making in GRIP. Those investments we're making as we ramp up, we see benefit in 2012, with very clear line of sight of where that's going to come from. And again, I contrast that. And the reason I'm spending a bit of time on this, it's important you understand the nature of that investment around building the technology platform, putting it in place, bringing it in front of carrier, potential carriers, having them actually buy into it and come online, gives us very clear confidence in sort of what it means to ramp that up and get benefit out of that. And we see that from a people investment in '12. And then the others are the more traditional. So it's essentially adding 300, 400, 500 people across Latin America and Asia because we see big opportunities and that's going to take a bit more of time to play out.
Christa Davies: And we certainly see the revenue from these coming in Q4 and we see the investments ramping down in Q3.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then maybe on the HR Solutions side, similar commentary. I mean, is it back half of 2012?
Christa Davies: Yes. Well, what we would say is, and I did say, that we expect that operating income is going to be down modestly year-over-year in Q2 and Q3 and flat in Q4 before growing in 2013. And really, the investments we said were going to be $40 million in 2011 and an additional $35 million in 2012. And that $35 million is really front-half weighted because we do see revenues coming in the exchange business in Q4 because it ties with the annual enrollment cycle, which is at that time period of the year.
Gregory C. Case: It's almost as if you think about, literally, the series of investment ARS, Aon Benfield are ahead of where Aon Hewitt is. Aon Hewitt has come online, we've actually now -- we've got a clear sight of what we think we want the portfolio to look like, where we see the investment opportunities to be. Those play out a bit longer term, as Christa just described. And the others are going to yield benefits much sooner because, frankly, they're in a -- we've actually had a bit more time to work with them over the last few years.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe going back to GRIP a little bit, I guess one of the things that I struggle with, I certainly understand the benefits of the GRIP platform, but towards, I guess, larger insurance carriers. But maybe can you talk about the value proposition that you offer towards smaller insurance carriers because I think that really makes up the majority, I guess, of the carriers around the world?
Gregory C. Case: Well, this is, again, the opportunity really is, it's carriers around the world, it really is about how we align their capital and where they want to place it with our flow around the world. So again, obviously, nothing's ever guaranteed. But to be able to match their interest with our flow is an incredibly powerful thing. So if you're a carrier virtually of any size around the world and you have a view on where you want to invest and how you want to invest, what GRIP does is enable you to actually get access, get exposure, get true connection to our flow in a way that you can actually apply your capital and win business. And we've actually, as we talked about proving the concept, we've actually worked with large carriers and medium-sized carriers both. And just for reference, proving the concept, 25 carriers is what we talked about. We work with over 2,000 carriers around the globe, so this a very large percentage. We absolutely don't believe that all of them are going to engage in this, nor do we want them to, nor do they need to. But we believe the opportunity is substantial, really, if you're a large carrier, a medium-sized carrier or small carrier.
Operator: Next question comes from Adam Klauber, William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: On the Consulting business, for margins to turn around 2013, do you need more than flat to 2% revenue growth?
Christa Davies: No, Adam. What we're really looking at occurring 2012 to 2013 is the ramp-down of the investments and the ramp-up of the savings. And those 2 things will put us to operating income growth in 2013.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then as far as GRIP, I mean, from what I've been hearing it's actually been very successful. Revenues, which you haven't disclosed, but from what I've heard they're at least north of $100 million and maybe materially more than that. I'm not asking you to validate that, but why isn't that more margin accretive if the revenues are becoming substantial? And then number two, because it has been very successful, at some point, will you give us an idea what the revenues are?
Gregory C. Case: Yes. I think as we said back, again, we wanted to be -- we want to first be very careful in terms of how we put items in place that will actually improve our ability to serve our clients, which GRIP does. Support our markets and our carriers, which GRIP does. And as we said before kind of proving the concept and making sure that we could provide value to both those constituents with very sophisticated large carriers, medium-sized carriers and carriers around the world, is exactly what we wanted to do. Obviously, for competitive reasons, I know this is going to be pretty sensitive in terms of sort of how we think about this. But over time, we, as we said before, are doing this because we think it gives us a fundamentally better platform. These analytics help our clients very substantially and the markets very substantially, and it improves our operating leverage. So in essence, if you think about sort of our ability to improve margin, as Christa described before, on lower levels of growth, we believe, quite strongly, that GRIP will help us do that. And so why isn't it showing up in 2012, if that's the case? And this is really the ramp-up. So this is a fundamental decision taken by Aon and its leadership team over the last couple of years to invest behind what we believe is a unique data set in the world today to operationalize it and actually get it in front of clients in a way that we can actually monetize it. It's taken us a period of time to do that. By the way, I wish we would have -- I wish we could have done it faster and we could have done it in months instead of a couple of years, but it's taken that time to actually pull all this together. And what you see now is the ramp up and that's really the first 3 quarters. But we also want to highlight, maybe, slightly different in most "investments" that are made sort of in the brokerage world in which you bring in a broker and talk about an 18- to 24-month payback. We know what this looks like and we said we're going to have positive brokerage margin in 2012, which highlights sort of how this could be accretive.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And one follow-up question. As far as organic growth in the Risk Solutions business, Americas was up. Is part of that driven by the U.S. doing better with better rate and exposure? And given that rate and exposure seems to build, would you continue -- would you expect that to continue to do better throughout the rest of the year?
Gregory C. Case: Yes. I would say, first of all, Americas is up 4%, international is up 4% and we feel good about -- we always want to grow more, but we feel good about this from the standpoint. When you think about our European book, which is very, very substantial for us, disproportionately substantial -- and by the way, the renewal for that is about 50% in the first quarter. So that had a bit of a drag, when you think about all the things that are going on in Europe. Although our European colleagues did a remarkable job. Then the Americas, as you said, up 4%. U.S. was not really impacted by the market. We had minimal price impact in the U.S. It was really management of the renewable book and what we've done with Client Promise and a number of other things that's really helped us. We looked at something called rollover, which is you keep the client, literally, what happens to the revenue in the context of that. And that improved -- that's really what helped us. New business was roughly flat across the board. Retention was strong, rollover was up and it was really driven by management actions here more than it was the overall market. We think we've got a lot of leverage still out there to GDP pricing improvement, if it shows up over time, but we didn't see it as much in Q1.
Operator: Next question, Jay Cohen, BofA Merrill Lynch.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a couple of questions. I guess on the HR Solutions business, so the guidance seems to have, I guess, come down a little bit for this year relative to what you've talked about last quarter. And I'm wondering what changed in the last 3 months to cause that?
Christa Davies: Yes. Jay, there are really 2 things that changed. We transferred $26 million of savings to the Risk Solutions segment related to Health and Benefits and we have a slightly more conservative view on discretionary spend for project-related revenue. And so we'd now expect operating income to be down modestly year-over-year, whereas -- I did say in Q4 that we thought it will be up modestly year-over-year. And we certainly believe that it will grow in 2013 as the investments ramp down and the savings ramp up. And we improved the core business performance.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: But the transfer of the savings, you kind of knew about before?
Christa Davies: Yes. I mean, I think as we sort of -- as we transfer that business and allocated the savings, I think it's really sort of $26 million of the savings were delivered in Q1 and I think we've got an incremental $26 million of savings that are going to come through. And so I think having seen the savings come through in Q1, I think it's just giving us a better clarity to the amount of savings that are going to happen related to the Health and Benefits business.
Gregory C. Case: I would highlight, Jay, as Christa said, the savings came over, so I think they're going to show up throughout the year. But this has not been a trivial exercise. It's $720-plus million of revenue that moved over. We weren't sure exactly sort of what specific pieces. We now have much more clarity on exactly what it means to the penny that sort of bring this business over. So that's really what we actually -- we upped. I would reflect, as you step back, really I think to the core of your question is, how are we feeling about the business long term? And I would say, that remains unchanged. We've got sort of timing and movement in the middle. There have been some deal model changes around H and B, in which we made a decision, as Christa described, core business we've talked about. But long term, we feel very positive about where we are with Aon Hewitt and how's it evolving over time. And again, this is -- you can look at the movie, go back and look at what's happened in Aon Benfield, go back and look what's happened -- and see what we're doing with GRIP now and what we're doing with Aon Risk Solutions. Aon Hewitt's sort of the next in the line and we see that progressing. There'll be puts and takes, but we see it progressing very well.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Great. And then the other topic is, on the Risk side. I guess, what's a little frustrating is that you guys did a really great job of improving margins over many years in what was a horrendous environment. And the environment certainly feels a lot better. So of course, the expectation has been you would see much more significant margin improvement when this environment has finally arrived. But you've been investing all along. Is [ph] the investment incrementally higher, could you say you were under investing for a couple of years in retrospect? I guess, can you address that frustration that people have?
Gregory C. Case: So I first of all, Jay, fully understand the frustration and sort of, particularly, quarter-to-quarter movement and margin improvement. And I would ask you to do the following. Step back, think about sort of how this has worked over time, sort of on the Risk Solutions side, 320 basis point improvement from 2007, a 500 basis point improvement in 2005 against the headwinds that you described. In that context, we invested a lot. By the way, we also had a lot of restructuring savings that we could absolutely absorbed. As those wound down, we still have some left. We took full advantage of that, in our view, invest more heavily in the business than we think probably anyone in the industry. And in fact, it didn't show up in quarter-to-quarter, it shows up over time. The biggest investment we've made sort of outside of the traditional adding talent is the investment in growth. And what you're really starting to see is the confidence we've got to ramp that up. And what we're essentially saying is, that ramp-up happens in '12 and yet you're still going to see margin improvement in '12, even with that ramp-up and then you're going to see substantial operating leverage in '13. So I understand your frustration quarter-to-quarter, but I'd ask you to step back and say, in the end, when you get done with 2012, we're going to have GRIP basically ramped up; Aon Broking fully online, a platform which is, we believe, fundamentally higher leverage platform from an operation standpoint than anything we've ever had before; client-serving capability that we think is going to be stronger; and our ability to connect with markets and generate revenue streams to support markets, which is also stronger and unique. And while we'd always love to produce quarter-to-quarter, we will take that trade to get to that position for 2012 and establish 2013 to '14. It's just something that we're going to do to build our firm long term.
Christa Davies: And Jay, I'd say as we allocate capital, we think about return on capital as the right metric. And as the growth prospects improve in our business, the return on capital of these investments also improves. And therefore, we're actually investing more. And so I think that's what you're really seeing in this calendar year.
Operator: Next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Two quick questions here for you. First one, Greg, I was hoping -- or Christa you could talk a little bit about the impact of the price competition in the Benefits Administration business on your organic revenue growth. Kind of what you expect it's going to be going forward, as well as on margins? Kind of what's the headwind from that?
Christa Davies: Yes. Brian, we continue to see pricing competition in the Benefits Administration business. It's exactly in line with what we originally modeled when we did the deal, and it's been fairly consistent over the last 3 years. It hasn't got materially better, but it hasn't got materially worse. And so what I would say is, that is absolutely impacting core business performance, and we continue to talk about that. The other thing I would say though is, project revenue, which is high-margin revenue, is not offsetting this. And that was one of the things we had originally anticipated to offset this pricing competition. And so I think that's really sort of the impact in this calendar year that's different from what we had originally modeled.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: When do you anticipate project revenue to start picking up again?
Christa Davies: I think we would expect that it correlates with the economic growth, it correlates with M&A and we would expect that to occur Q4 and 2013.
Gregory C. Case: In many respects, Brian, if you think about where we are, this is no different than the question, is there a competition in Aon Benfield for our treaty business? Is there competition in Aon Risk Solutions for large corporate arenas, et cetera? These are the things we do every day. There is definitely price competition, it will always be there. We're going to always come back and go to the market around Aon offering that we believe is highly value-oriented and highly value-based. Our objective is to deliver more value per dollar than anyone else. That means we should have a price premium. We have to support that price premium with real value. And that's really what we're working through with our team and they're doing a great job at sort of reacting to the market and coming back with different ideas and perspectives. The good news about this sector, just like it is on the Risk side, is you step back and say, fundamentally, is there real client demand. Our client -- do clients need to actually do something about health and benefits growth, cost growth that shows up in their P&L every year, and the answer is yes. Do they need to do something about pension, and pension challenges? Yes. Can you do something about the talent side and the rewards side? Yes. So we see client demand high, competition similar as we see across our businesses and it's our job to react to it and deal with it.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then second question, Christa, can you talk about when should we start seeing the benefits in your tax rate from the redomestication? And maybe give us some numbers around, potentially, how much?
Christa Davies: Yes. So Brian, we've said we expect significant reduction in the global effective tax rate over the long term, and we've said that is similar to what we've achieved over the last 5 years, which is really a sort of a 500 basis point reduction and in line with certain global competitors. And we do expect the global effective tax rate for calendar year 2012 to be 28%.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then -- but the 500 basis points should be coming off of 2011 tax rate, right?
Christa Davies: Correct. And it will happen over the long term, Brian.
Operator: Next question comes from Yaron Kinar, Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Maybe to follow-up on Jay's question earlier on the Risk Solutions side. So granted looking backwards, there's a bit of a frustration, which I'm sure you feel as well. But frustration also sometimes breeds some concern. Looking forward, I understand that the investments in GRIP will slow down, but clearly, you're not going to rest on your laurels, you're going to look for further improvements and further investment in the business. So how should we think about margins as new initiatives come around? Should we still expect kind of the 26% target to be intact? Do you have any ideas as to how much time it would take to get there with continued investments?
Gregory C. Case: Yes. Listen, the 26% next step that we've described -- by the way, in the next step of our evolution on the margin side is in full force and we have absolute focus on achieving it and aim to improve operating margin, risk margin every year until we get to the 26%. Then we'll come back and talk to you about sort of where we are from there. But we, Yaron, see, really, the investments we're making this year and what we're able to do in GRIP, actually, in our view, increases the probability substantially. I think we're marching our way toward 26%. And we've essentially said irrespective of market conditions, irrespective of investments over time. Repeat that, market conditions and investments over time, we're going to get to a 26% margin. If you go back and look at our history, what we've been able to achieve, we'll see how 2012 plays out and where we are in 2013. But I want to emphasize 26% is the next step in the journey. And we think -- what we were able to achieve in 2011, we're actually quite excited about in terms of the opportunity, and excited about how it's going to play out in '12 and set the stage for '13 and '14.
Christa Davies: And we would say, Yaron, that on the journey's 26%, the single biggest contributor to it is the Aon Broking initiative and the investments we're making in GRIP. And so that's why we feel so confident about getting to the 26% margin.
Gregory C. Case: I mean one of the things I would say is, if we were -- one, we're backing off. You'd say we made these investments, let's see what happens. We essentially say we're ramping up these investments and we're going to get margin improvement in 2012. The and there is quite important.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on the Consulting side, clearly, you're making a lot of investments in the health care exchanges as well. What happens if in June, the Supreme Court ends up repealing or deciding that the mandate is not constitutional or anything of that nature? Does that affect the timing of revenue ramp-up? Does it affect the magnitude of revenues that you expect coming in?
Gregory C. Case: Yes. I think, in the end -- you never know exactly how this is going to play out and what decisions are going to get made. We come back to the fundamentals. And the fundamentals here are, literally, is there going to be health care out there? Yes. Is there going to be a need for companies to play a role in that in helping their employees? Yes. And will there be a big need for advice to increase that we'll have to ramp up as employers are trying to navigate in the new world? And we think in almost every case, the answer to that is yes. That's going to be very, very positive from that standpoint. And we don't believe the Supreme Court ruling is going to have a material impact on the business overall. It could affect the timing, plus or minus. But overall, we think the majority of what we do for clients continues to stand, irrespective of the outcome of the overall decision.
Operator: Next question comes from Matthew Heimermann, JPMorgan Chase.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I guess, a couple of clarification questions. One, just on the -- thinking about buybacks for the year, you gave guidance in 4Q, when you reported 4Q in early February. Previously, you'd made a comment that once the deal closed, you get access to $300 million of international cash and that could be used for buybacks. I just wanted to make sure that, in fact, the plan still was to use that $300 million and just -- is it fair to think about kind of a 12-month time horizon in terms of potentially, incrementally laying that into your buyback expectation?
Christa Davies: Yes. So for 2012, we had said that we do approximately $100 million in Q1 and $150 million per quarter from Q2 to Q4, with potential for the $300 million of additional purchase using the excess capital in the balance sheet. And there is no change to that guidance. I don't think it's in our best interest to provide specific guidance on the timing. But it is worthwhile saying that any incremental use of cash flow or excess capacity, including the $300 million of cash held internationally, will be evaluated and allocated on the highest return on invested capital. And we continue to believe that share buyback is the highest return on capital across the firm because we look at the long-term growth prospects for Aon and we have an internal valuation, which is substantially higher than where we're trading at today, and we will be opportunistic about taking advantage of that.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Well, just, I guess, without telling, I'm not looking for quarter per se, but if the stock trades here, let's say, over the next 12 months, is 12 months a reasonable time frame if that's your highest return on capital option?
Christa Davies: Yes. I mean, again, we're not going to provide specific timing and guidance. But of course, if it's our highest return on capital, then we will take advantage of any opportunities. And history's a very good guide of future behavior.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, it just kind of sound -- it sounded when you talked about it before like it was a no-brainer, it would happen. The way talked about it now makes it sound like it's a little bit more. . .
Christa Davies: I would go back to what I said before, which is there is no change in guidance.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Other question I had was just in the reinsurance business. Could you maybe give us a sense of what's happening in the treaty growth side property versus casualty? And I guess the reason I'm asking is, you made a comment about retention cutbacks being a headwind, and I'm just -- my suspicion would be that, that might continue to be more of a casualty issue than a property issue, but just any color there would be great. And also just whether or not capital markets was incremental to the quarter or not?
Gregory C. Case: Yes. So Aon Benfield as we described drove 5% organic for the quarter, which is the best we've done in quite some time. The real -- when you think about that overall impact, market impact was a piece of it, but it was relatively smaller, very low single digits. By the way, it was a bit pricing but also by retention as we described before. By far, the biggest impact on the quarter was the treaty book. So it wasn't fact [ph], and it wasn't capital markets, it was the treaty book. And it was really new business over lost business from that period of time. And that's really what drove the growth of the quarter. If you think about the property book for us about 70% of the book overall and the new business is really all from properties. We've thought about sort of what we've done and the team's just done a great job. Really, as we brought the firms together and described, before -- essentially, the first year was sort of clients really couldn't react because we were so close to the renewal deadlines in 2009. 2010, they kind of did their adjustments. 2011, we really saw the beginning of the ramp up. Where we were winning more and more new business. And what you saw this quarter was not really market, as much as it was new business generation.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then any -- on the loss side, how are retention trends year-on-year?
Gregory C. Case: Yes. Retention trends have been very, very good year-on-year, in fact, increasing and really has been one of the issues we've had to deal with. So as these prices gone up and retention has sort of burned back about half of that when you think about sort of what we're looking at for the quarter overall.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And just can I get the ending common share count?
Gregory C. Case: Say again?
Christa Davies: Yes. Share count, hang on just a minute. So share count as at March 31 was 326.4 million.
Operator: Next question Meyer Shields, Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I think the specificity that you're giving in terms of the expense is helpful in alleviating the frustration everyone's been talking about, so I'm going to push for little bit more. I guess over the past few years, you've had the investment expenses associated with building GRIP. In addition to the ramp up now, should we expect that former category to ease up in 2013?
Gregory C. Case: Yes. In fact, great question. Literally, this has come online. If you think about what you have to do, you step back and basically realize you're running on top of the better part of $60 billion of flow, didn't really know exactly how it'd come together and how it would fit and how you could actually bring it to the marketplace. So there's a set of analytics that, again, you don't really get a chance to monetize, as you pull that together, you just absorb that. That's substantial, but not as substantial as the ramp up. And then you actually take it to market. You prove the concept for 25 markets and you prove the concept and being able to actually offer different panels and offerings in the market place, which we did last summer. And then you basically say then we need to ramp it up, which is the final set of technology investments to broaden it. By the way, one of the reasons we brought the Health and Benefits business over is we literally give a chance to bring now the $24 billion of Health and Benefits flow into this fold, which is fantastic. And we're now working on doing that, expanding it more globally and then adding the people around it. But to your specific point, once that's done, we've got the platform in place. And the costs associated is much more variable with the additional revenue that comes with that. So again, it's back to the opportunity here to both strengthen our client-serving capability, strengthen how we link to the markets and, very important and, improve operating leverage in the business. Obviously, we don't give guidance here in terms of what this is going to be, but we see real opportunity in terms of sort of what it's going to create for us overall.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Any chance I could ask for -- not so much guidance, but what the annual investment expense run rate has been?
Gregory C. Case: Well, we said before, we really -- it's really part of the overall program. We don't give it out and break it out specifically. What we would come back and say is, the way you hold our feet to the fire is you look at brokerage margin year-over-year and that's we've got to include in our increase. And margins have been up substantial. If you think about sort of what we've been able to do over the last few years, and we have very high expectations on what we're going to be able to do over the next few years with this one opportunity.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And if I can drill down into one comment in the press release, where you talked about reduced retirement discretionary spend in the quarter. I guess, that surprised me because I didn't know that pension deficits were getting better. So if you could talk about what, maybe, macro factors are impacting the retirement revenues.
Christa Davies: Yes. So as we think about our retirement consulting business and the transition from DB to DC, then there really is a decline in that sort of actuarial business, which is being offset by the investments we're making in investment consulting. And that is why we're making the investments in investment consulting because it's a very high area of growth to help clients navigate, managing pension risk and thinking through their portfolio and their unfunded liabilities and managing that volatility correctly.
Operator: Our last question comes from Larry Greenberg, Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Just to beat the GRIP questions into the ground. Just curious, is it a fair conclusion that you're saying your -- I know you're not giving any specific numbers, but your 2013 risk margin will be higher than it otherwise would have been without this ramp up in investments? And then secondly, does this accelerate the time at which you're going to reach your 26% target?
Gregory C. Case: Larry, by the way, happy to beat this one into the ground as long as you'd like to do because this is certainly something we focus a lot on and it's very important, we think, to the continued progression at Aon. First of all, it does accelerate the movement. This is a step we wanted to take. Again, that improves our client-serving capability, our market-facing capability and increases leverage in the business. And as we said, if you think about it, we're not only going to make investments in '12, we're going to get the ramp-up investments, we're going to get yield in '12. So operating margin, we said, our Risk Solutions margin will increase in '12. And then in '13, obviously, it'll have a positive impact, perhaps, even a more positive impact in '13 than in '12 because you won't have the continued ramp-up costs. Those will have stabilized and you'll have the benefit.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: So yes to both of those, I guess?
Gregory C. Case: Yes.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case: I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Aon and look forward to our next discussion.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Corporation's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Corporation. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
Gregory C. Case: Thank you, Leslie, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. To begin, we finished the year with a quarter that was both challenging and exciting for our firm, challenging in a sense that the macroeconomic and industry pressure continues to be felt in many markets around the globe, albeit at a lesser pace, exciting in a sense that we took significant steps to substantially strengthen our global firm for long-term growth and value creation, including the proposed relocation of our corporate headquarters to London.  Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. And we'd note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is overall organic growth performance; and third is continued areas of investment across Aon.  On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share.  Turning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue was 3% overall, with growth across Risk and HR Solutions highlighted by 4% growth in both Reinsurance and Outsourcing. Adjusted operating margin decreased 70 basis points, driven by an increase in intangible amortization expense over the prior year. And finally, EPS increased 15%, driven by strong underlying performance and effective capital management. For the full year, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, an improvement from flat in 2010 and minus 1% in 2009. Adjusted operating margin decreased 180 basis points, which includes 140 basis points of intangible amortization impact and the inclusion of Hewitt results. Finally, EPS increased 5%, driven by strong underlying performance and effective capital management.  Overall, we finished the year with improved organic revenue across our business, delivered cost savings, took significant steps to strengthen our firm and are effectively allocating capital, giving us both excitement and confidence in our ability to drive improved performance across our key metrics in 2012.  Turning to Slide 5, on the second topic of growth. I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 3%, with growth across all major businesses. As market-related conditions continue to stabilize, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and leverage to an improving economy, with management of our renewal books through Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction; new business generation of nearly $280 million across our Retail business, with solid growth across many markets, including China, Latin America, New Zealand and The Netherlands, just to name a few, highlighting the strength of our global client serving capability; investments in new products and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP, Aon Broking and Client Promise globally; and in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 3 consecutive quarters.  Reflecting on individual businesses, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 3% as pricing and exposures are relatively flat. We saw solid new business growth in both Canada and Latin America and strong management of the renewal book portfolio, utilizing Client Promise in Latin America and the U.S. Results reflect strong performance, overcoming continued market weakness in the commercial construction sector. On the international side, organic revenue growth was 1% as pricing was flat to modestly down on average, with firmer pricing in catastrophe-exposed regions, really a strong performance given the plus 6% in the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth in emerging markets and across Asia-Pacific, including double-digit growth in areas such as Thailand, China, Japan and Malaysia. U.K. and Continental Europe continue to be pressured as economic conditions remain fragile across many core markets in the region.  In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 4%, an improvement from minus 1% in the prior quarter and a level of organic revenue performance not achieved since Q2 2009. The results reflect strong growth in our capital markets and advisory business and modest growth in our global facultative placements. In our core book of treaty reinsurance, the impact of the market from pricing and cedent retentions were stable, and the underlying strength of the book continues to improve as net new business won was positive for the third consecutive quarter. This trend in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's strong value proposition for clients while strengthening operational performance, reducing volatility through unmatched data analytics and advisory capability, a central thesis in the Benfield acquisition we announced roughly 3 years ago. Overall, annual organic revenue was minus 3% in 2010, now flat in 2011, and we're firmly on track for growth in 2012.  Reflecting on HR Solutions, overall, organic revenue growth was 3%, with growth in both businesses, a solid improvement from minus 2% in the prior quarter. Performance primarily reflects strong growth in areas where we're making significant investments in the business, in areas such as investment consulting, healthcare exchanges and HR BPO.  Turning to the individual businesses. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 4% compared to minus 2% in the prior quarter. We saw growth from both new client wins in HR BPO and from our healthcare exchanges. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in Benefits Administration due to price compression within expectations in client losses.  On the Consulting side, organic revenue growth was 2%, with improved growth across most major practices from the prior quarter, overall, a solid improvement from minus 2% in Q3. We saw growth globally in Health and Benefits and in investment consulting, and results were partially offset by a decline in demand for retirement consulting.  Overall, in HR Solutions, we're pleased with our growth performance in the fourth quarter and would expect modest growth in 2012 across both businesses. And while encouraged that we're beginning to deliver growth from our investments, our priorities for 2012 focus on driving improved profitability for our investments and improving the growth profile in our core Benefits Administration and retirement consulting businesses.  Slide 6 highlights the third topic, further areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid, long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong cash flow continues to enable substantial investments in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include: In Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the Revenue Engine in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates across our client base. We continue to invest in innovative technology such as our Global Risk Insight Platform, which is the world's leading global repository of risk and insurance placement information. We now have 1.3 million trades, more than 65 billion of bound premium and a growing list of 25 insurance carriers utilizing the platform's analytics and service capabilities.  We're driving our Aon Broking initiatives to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, resulting in better economics for all participants, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients.  And finally, effective January 1, 2012, we're aligning our global Health and Benefits platform under Risk Solutions to better leverage a broader global distribution channel and to strengthen the deep brokerage capability in data and analytics with clients and insurance carriers. As we discussed previously, we have proved the concept of these investments in 2011, and as we move into 2012 and 2013, we're going to continue to drive greater scale and increasing operating leverage as a result of these investments in our Risk Solutions business.  In HR Solutions, we're expanding our international footprint as the workforce is increasingly becoming more global with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets. We're continuing to invest in expanding our core HR BPO offerings through point solutions opportunities such as dependent eligibility audits and absence management diagnostics. And we're expanding our industry-leading benefits services platform from large market to middle market.  Finally, we continue to strengthen our industry-leading position in healthcare exchanges, enabling clients to prepare for ultimate changes in healthcare legislation with design, purchasing administration capability.  In summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, we delivered organic revenue growth across both Risk and HR Solutions, made significant investments in long-term growth opportunities and took important steps to strengthen our global firm. Our fundamental client serving capability continues to strengthen substantially around the globe, and the firm is positioned for increased growth in 2012.  With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review.
Christa Davies: Thanks very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our fourth quarter and full year results reflect continued progress to strengthen our industry-leading platform, and the firm is positioned to increase growth in 2012. We are managing expenses through savings from our restructuring programs, generating strong cash flow and effectively allocating capital as highlighted by the repurchase of $828 million of common stock in 2011.  Now let me turn to the financial results as highlighted on Page 7 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, was $0.97 per share for the fourth quarter, up 15% from $0.84 in the prior-year quarter. Strong underlying performance and effective capital management more than offset a $21 million increase in intangible amortization in the quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance are highlighted in the schedules of Page 14 on the press release.  In addition, foreign currency translations had a favorably impact of $0.01. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a modest unfavorable translation impact to EPS in the first quarter of 2012. Starting in the first quarter of 2012 and going forward, the company will provide adjusted results that exclude the impact of noncash intangible amortization and certain onetime items. We believe the exclusion of noncash intangible amortization will more closely align external audiences and the company around cash flow generation. We drive capital management and shareholder value creation through cash-on-cash returns.  The schedule on Page 15 of the press release reflects this disclosure. I would note that EPS in the fourth quarter, excluding certain items and intangible amortization, was $1.16, up 20% from $0.97 in the prior-year quarter.  Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, and we delivered an operating margin of 21.8% on an adjusted basis, essentially flat with the prior-year quarter, including a 20 basis point unfavorable impact for costs related to the integration of the Glenrand acquisition. On an adjusted basis, operating income increased 3% or $10 million to $397 million. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by an increase in organic revenue and modest benefits related to the restructuring programs.  Let me spend a moment on each of the restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. With respect to the 2007 restructuring program, we have incurred 100% of the charges necessary to deliver savings. Restructuring savings in the fourth quarter are estimated $134 million compared to $128 million in the prior-year quarter. Approximately $113 million of savings were related to the Risk Solutions segment. The program is now complete, having delivered an estimated $536 million of cumulative savings in 2011.  With respect to the Aon Benfield restructuring program, we incurred $21 million of charges in the fourth quarter and have now completed 96% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings. The remaining charges of $7 million will be incurred in the first quarter, which will complete the charges under this program. Restructuring savings in the fourth quarter are estimated at $33 million compared to $27 million in the prior-year quarter. The Aon Benfield restructuring program delivered $122 million of cumulative expense savings in 2011 and is expected to deliver cumulative expense savings of $144 million in 2012.  Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 12.4%, down 120 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter, including 190 basis point unfavorable impact related to intangible amortization. On an adjusted basis, operating income decreased 6% or $10 million to $147 million. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by $22 million increase in intangible amortization; significant investment in long-term growth opportunities, including our healthcare exchange business; and an unfavorable revenue mix shift due to an organic revenue decline in Benefits Administration and retirement consulting. Excluding the impact of noncash intangible amortization, operating income increased 6% to $209 million in the quarter, reflecting savings from the restructuring program.  With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $25 million of charges in the quarter primarily related to workforce reduction. Cumulative savings related to restructuring program in the fourth quarter are estimated at $43 million compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter, with additional synergy savings of approximately $27 million achieved outside of the formal restructuring program. For 2011, we achieved an estimated $233 million of cumulative restructuring and synergy savings compared to $4 million of savings in the prior year. Of the achieved savings in 2011, we estimate approximately 75% were realized in operating income before intangible amortization. Realized savings were less than 100% due to approximately $40 million of investment in long-term growth opportunities and weaker performance in certain core businesses. We are not satisfied with this performance, and as Greg noted, our priorities for 2012 are centered on driving improved profitability for our investments and certain of our core businesses.  As we think about 2012, we would expect to deliver improved performance as we progress throughout the year. Before any adjustments related to the transfer of the Health and Benefits business, we'd expect to realize approximately 75% of incremental restructuring and synergy savings, expect to invest an additional $35 million in long-term growth opportunities across HR BPO, healthcare exchanges and additional talent to expand our distribution and would expect intangible amortization to increase approximately $63 million. In short, including intangible amortization, we would expect operating income to be down modestly through 2011. Excluding intangible amortization, we would expect operating income to be up modestly.  Turning to the next slide, on our long-term operating margin targets. Effective January 1, 2012, the company moved the global Aon Hewitt Health and Benefits business from the HR Solutions segment into the Risk Solutions segment. This move will allow the business to benefit from broader global distribution channel and to promote the company's deep Health and Benefits capabilities with clients and insurance carriers. Additionally, as we noted last quarter and mentioned earlier, the company will begin reporting adjusted results for Q1 that exclude the impact of intangible amortization and certain onetime benefits. Historical selected financial information for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 that reflect financial reporting changes for both the Health and Benefits transfer and for intangible amortization are provided in the press release this morning. This financial information will provide comparability to results reported in the first quarter of 2012.  We recognize there are significant changes this quarter but believe these reflect greater transparency and focus our results on cash flow growth, which is how we run the company. Adjusting for these reporting changes, our new long-term operating margin target of 26% for Risk Solutions reflects significant opportunity for margin expansion in the following 5 ways: first, remaining restructuring savings and other operational improvements; second, continued rollout of the Revenue Engine internationally; third, Aon Broking and GRIP-related initiatives. These 3 are fully within our control. In addition, there are 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant operating leverage based on improvements in the external market. Fourth, increases in short-term interest rates; and fifth, industry improvements driving higher insured values or insurance pricing.  Similarly, for HR Solutions, adjusting for these reporting changes, our new long-term operating margin target of 22% reflects significant opportunity for margin improvement in the following 3 ways: first, deliver $335 million of synergy savings in 2013; second, growth in the core business and return on incremental investments; third, improvement in HR BPO.  Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on the next slide. Unallocated expenses increased $5 million to $43 million, including costs for project-related work. Interest income decreased $2 million to $4 million due to lower average interest rates. Interest expense decreased $6 million to $59 million due primarily to a decline in the average rate on total debt outstanding. Other income of $4 million in the fourth quarter includes gains on certain company-owned life insurance plans, partially offset by losses on the company's ownership and certain private equity securities and other long-term investments. Going forward, we continue to expect a run rate of approximately $5 million per quarter of interest income, $35 million to $40 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter. Minority interest was $3 million compared to $10 million in the prior year due to lower performance of certain joint ventures and partnerships. We would expect minority interest to be approximately $8 million to $10 million per quarter going forward.  Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations declined to 27% in the quarter compared to 32.8% in the prior-year quarter. The prior-year quarter was impacted by certain deferred tax adjustments, and the improvement in the current quarter was primarily due to certain discrete items. The company anticipates an effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations of 29% to 2012.  Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 337.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to 346.7 million in the prior-year quarter due primarily to the company's share repurchase program throughout 2011. The company was not able to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter due to the subsequent announcement of the headquarters relocation. Actual common shares outstanding on December 31 were 324.4 million, and there are approximately 14 million diluted stock equivalents. The company has approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase program previously authorized in 2010. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At December 31, cash and short-term investments were $1.1 billion and total debt outstanding was $4.5 billion. Overall debt to capital was 35.7% at December 31, 2011, compared to 35.3% at December 31, 2010. Cash flow from operations for 2011 was $1 billion, up 30% from $783 million in the prior year due primarily to an increase in net income resulting from the inclusion of Hewitt and improved operational performance, partially offset by pension contributions and restructuring payments.  Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less capital expenditure, was $777 million, up 29% from $603 million in the prior year. Strength of the firm's free cash flow generation enabled more than $1 billion of capital to be returned to shareholders in 2011 through $828 million of share repurchase and $200 million of dividends.  Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we are taking significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and de-risk certain plan assets. In 2011, we contributed approximately $477 million to our plans and would expect to contribute approximately $541 million in 2012 before any discretionary contributions. Higher contributions primarily reflect a decline in discount rates. We would expect the contributions to decline annually beginning in 2013, resulting in fully funded plans on a GAAP basis in 2016.  Regarding noncash pension expense, we incurred $87 million of expense in 2011 and would expect a modest decline in 2012. Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were $178 million in 2011. As our restructuring plans continue to wind down, we would expect cash payments to decline $23 million to approximately $155 million in 2012 before declining further in 2013. As our required uses of cash decline over the next several years and free cash flow increases, we expect it to be a significant source of value creation for shareholders. As an important step in unlocking that value for shareholders, the company announced it will change its jurisdiction of incorporation from Delaware to the U.K. and move its corporate headquarters to London. The transaction requires a shareholder vote to approve and is on track to close in the second quarter of 2012. We believe the relocation will help drive shareholder value through providing greater global access to expected increases in future cash flow, enabling us to access approximately $300 million of excess capital held internationally on our balance sheet upon confirmation of the transaction and increased future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term.  In summary, we delivered improved organic revenue in 2011, placing us firmly on track to increased growth in 2012. We have significant leverage to an improving global economy. We are managing expenses and fully on track to achieve our long-term operating margin targets. Our balance sheet and strong cash flow continue to provide significant financial flexibility as we return more than $1 billion of capital to shareholders and took significant steps to increase long-term shareholder value in 2011, highlighting our belief in the underlying strength of the firm.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Ray Iardella of Macquarie.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Just a quick question. I think first, surrounding Europe. I know, Greg, you had mentioned in your commentary there was some weakness in the international Brokerage segment from that. But I'm just curious, was there any headwind on the Consulting or the HR Solutions side?
Gregory C. Case: Ray, as we look at Europe overall, again, the natural expected sort of headwinds are there as you think about sort of how the economy's evolving. But we've been able to actually fight through those reasonably well, really, across the board, when you think of sort of where we are. We've seen on the HR Solutions side, consulting growth in multiple places across the region, especially when you compare to the previous quarter. So we feel pretty good about that. The headwinds are real from an economic standpoint, where we're fighting through those. Same on the HR -- or the Risk side as well. And when we reported 1%, we think about sort of where we were in the same quarter of last year, it was really an incredible, almost unprecedented quarter in terms of sort of overall organic growth. So net-net, we're cautious about what's going on in the economy. We feel good about our ability to kind of fight against that and serve our clients.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Great. And then quickly, on the reinsurance brokerage, I mean, I guess part of the growth there has been driven by the capital markets business. And I know 4Q '10 was a pretty tough comp, and certainly, delivering 4% growth there was quite impressive. But could you give a little bit more color on maybe -- was it cat bonds? I mean, what else might be driving that growth there?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, look, I think as you reflect back on Aon Benfield overall, we feel good about where we are. The quarter, specifically, we highlighted was capital advisory and some facultative side, but -- which, by the way, drove a good portion of the growth. But if you reflect on kind of the evolution of Aon Benfield and reflect kind of back, when we actually brought together Aon Benfield then in the fourth quarter of 2008, we essentially said, "Look, this business is going to -- because so much of the renewal was January 1, there wasn't going to be a lot of movement in 2009." And in fact, overall growth was about 0. For 2009, we're roughly flat. We're down roughly 3% in 2010, when a lot of the adjustments occurred, at some of the rebalancing happened. And then now in 2011 for the year, we're 0% overall and 4% as you reflect in the fourth quarter 2011. As interesting to us is literally, over the last 3 quarters, when we looked at business won, net new business versus business lost, we've been strongly positive for the last 3 quarters. And what this just highlights for us is exactly the thesis we had going into this transaction and this combination was that the client serving capability of Aon Benfield was just incredibly substantial to help clients improve operating performance, strengthen balance sheets, decrease volatility. And we simply just have -- we have a greater array of analytic capability than anyone in the world out there at this point, and that served us very well. And after the adjustments that I've just described, the platform is actually fully in place and established for long-term growth.
Operator: Next question, Keith Walsh of Citi.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: First question for Greg is just around Brokerage margins, just maybe a broader question. Since you arrived in '05, you've grown margins every year, except 2011. So I guess when we think about the things you can control, such as GRIP, Aon Broking, why aren't they moving the needle now that the cost saves are winding down? We're a couple of years into those. And then I've got a follow-up.
Gregory C. Case: Sure, Keith. Listen, from our standpoint, we step back. We feel very good about the program and the progress to sort of drive into what is a 25% margin, as we described before, increasing now that we're going to -- from a cash perspective of 26% margin. And sort of the -- and as Christa described, the specific investments we have in place have, we believe described, are really getting -- have been proven in 2011, are really able to be scaled up in 2012, 2013, and that's working exceptionally -- that's working very well for us. We'd highlight -- by the way, as you described, while we were able to improve margins over the last 5 years, we did it against significant headwinds, and we made significant investments in the business. By the way, we're doing the same thing on the HR Solutions side when we saw opportunities. So things like GRIP and others sort of were drags from a margin standpoint, but were very positive from kind of -- at a capability-building standpoint. So we are confident as we proceed in '12 and '13, '14 in our ability to actually drive improved margin going forward. I think there are some specific things for the quarter. Maybe Christa, you could comment on some of those that actually highlight some differences there as well.
Christa Davies: Yes, so if we look at 2011, Keith, in terms of Risk Solutions margin, there are obviously 2 big impacts. One was leases, which is a 50 basis point impact, and the other was the integration cost from Glenrand, which, we believe, is a fantastic investment for us in emerging markets and is going to generate a great return, and that was a 20 basis point impact. As we look forward to 2012, we do believe we'll expand Risk Solutions margin and the growth in Aon Benfield, that we believe we'll deliver, will certainly contribute to that. So we feel very good about the progress for 2012.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then just a follow-up to Christa on the HR business. I guess going back to the July 2010 presentation, you guys expected adjusted GAAP accretion of 1%-plus in '11 and 5.4% in 2012. And now you're telling us GAAP earnings are going to be down in 2012. I guess relative to the original targets, what specifically is causing this deal to underperform the original metrics?
Christa Davies: Yes, what we would say, Keith, actually, is that we feel better about the long-term outlook for our HR Solutions business than we did when we originally did the transaction. And evidence of that is the fact that we are investing significantly more than we had originally anticipated. We did mention that we've done $40 million of investments in the business in 2011, and we will increase that by a further $35 million in 2012. And those investments span healthcare exchanges, and we believe the opportunity for growth in healthcare is just enormous; our HR BPO business, which we are extremely pleased about; and areas like investment consulting. So we feel very good about that. And as we look at the performance in 2011, as we said, there is some underperformance in certain core businesses, which we aren't happy with. And we would say there's economic pressure -- there's some economic pressure from Europe. And then we have some work to do to continue to improve our performance.
Operator: Next question, Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple of questions here. First one, on the HR Solutions business, you did mention that one of the reasons for the weaker growth had to do with some client losses. What's that impact you think going to be for 2012? Was it significant, or was it something that shouldn't cause all that much of an issue in '12?
Gregory C. Case: Brian, this is really the natural progression of the business. We feel good about the overall growth prospects for the business, really, across the board. We're cautious about the economics and the economic environment, I should say, that Christa described. We feel good about the fundamental client serving capability. On the Consulting side and on the Outsourcing side as well, really, when you step back and think about Consulting, in particular, in this quarter, we really had growth across the board on almost every category: Health and Benefits, global comp, investment consulting, talent rewards. The pressure a little bit was on the retirement side, as expected, but really across the board. The net new news here is what Christa just described. The net new news is really the investments we're making against the opportunities we see. We just simply see greater opportunities than we anticipated on the healthcare exchange side, the HR BPO side, the investment consulting side, and we'll make those investments as a way to build long-term value for the business. And that's what we're going to look at and then work against the natural sort of characteristics and price compression characteristics on the Ben Admin side, which we fully expected as well.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then next question, given the pricing dynamics going on right now in the commercial insurance pricing environment, do you expect that to potentially be a tailwind for you all from an organic revenue growth perspective going in 2012?
Gregory C. Case: Well, listen, we've seen, as we described, and we've been very careful on this, and we look at it, Brian, as you know, quite analytically here. As we look at GRIP, and literally, this is sort of the kind of numeric reflection of exactly what's going on in the context of the overall marketplace, and I'll just go back to -- maybe I'll give you 5 numbers here. In Q4 2010, the overall market, this is across Aon's placements across the globe, minus 5.3%; Q1, it was minus 3.5%; Q2, it was minus 2.5%; Q3, minus 1.9%; and now flat in Q4. So we're seeing progression, and that's against -- across the overall system. Some ups, as you would expect in cat-exposed areas, some downs in areas like D&O, et cetera. But that's literally what's happening across the system. And when we think about Aon overall, again, we've made significant investments to build the platform for growth long term. If you think about where we were in '09, '10 and '11, we're at minus 1%, 0, now plus 2%, and we feel good about sort of continuing that trend moving into 2012.
Operator: Next question, Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, so just if you could talk a little bit about the move of the Benefits segment over to the Brokerage side. I'm just trying to understand from a distribution perspective. How does that work? Or do some of the same brokers distribute both insurance product as well as Health and Benefits? And just a follow-up.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, this is really for us. We're quite excited about this. It's an opportunity with great capability we have on the Health and Benefits side. It really was proven both Aon Hewitt and Aon Risk Solutions to bring those together. And really, it is about much stronger, greater access to clients around the world, in essence, the Health and Benefits capability now being brought to many Aon Risk Solutions clients. And in some respects, particularly in the middle market, they are the same buyer, so that's very much a CEO, CFO, and so it's a great opportunity there. In addition to that, it gives us the opportunity. They continue to work. As you think about sort of what we've done with GRIP on the Risk side, now we're adding Health and Benefits into that context. We've talked about a $60 billion overall flow across the Aon system. Now it's closer to $78 billion, almost $80 billion. So the opportunity to take very prudent approaches on the Aon Broking market side now get amplified doing this, and the access to clients gets amplified, particularly in the middle market and smaller commercial. We are, by the way, going to continue to keep investing behind the large corporate arena. We're very strongly positioned there, and we'll keep doing that. But we see this as really an opportunity to serve clients more effectively and are excited about it.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: But from a just kind of feet-on-the-ground perspective, does that mean that you'll have a broker kind of going into his client, as well as someone who will be representing Health and Benefits, sitting down sort of 3 people instead of 2 people? I'm just wondering, just kind of how does it work just from a feet-on-the-ground perspective?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, the mechanics really don't quite work that way, although I could see where you're coming from. Literally, the mechanics are -- at the end of the day, this has to actually ultimately get designed and then placed, broked and then placed. And so a lot of our ARS colleagues sort of reach out for that capability. Now they've got greater access to fully branded Aon Hewitt capability, but they would have had access before, and we just got a much, much more introduction. So literally, it's like this. We're in the middle market, where we've got the strongest position in the world. The largest portion of our book is middle market, small commercial. Our brokers are sitting across the table saying, "Wow. I'm doing everything for you on the risk side. I know we've got people challenges and Health and Benefits challenges. I see that, that causes going up on your P&L," which, by the way, is a big deal in the middle market, big deal on large corporate, too. And said, "Listen. I'd love to introduce you to what we believe is the best client serving capability in the world in health and benefits if it's helpful." And that's really how it's taken off. And again, this is something we've seen work quite effectively in multiple regions around the world. It's exactly, by the way, how it works in Latin America and has for many years. It's exactly how it's worked in some of our offices in the U.S. already. And so this is, again, in many respects, taking a proven approach which we've seen work and now scaling it quite substantially around the world. And I would say and observe is we've actually made the transition already where we're beginning reporting in January, as Christa described, but we saw H and Benefit -- H&B growth overall in Q4 even as we are going through the transition, so we feel very good about it.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then just one last one. Just you mentioned Europe before, so, I mean, can you talk a little bit about pipeline? I mean, you said you're kind of fighting through the headwinds there. What is your base case for Europe as you think about your business there, particularly on the Consulting side? And where do you see -- where's your pipeline for business now versus where it was maybe 3 or 6 months ago?
Gregory C. Case: Yes. We're still seeing good, strong, robust demand on the pipeline side. It's just, you can imagine, in Europe, clients are cautious. They're concerned about what's going to happen next. They have -- they might delay some projects that they would otherwise actually have done if they had a little more confidence or a little more certainty about what was going to happen. But in terms of sort of engaging with clients, seeing activity, that's remained quite robust. It really is just how we're actually serving them. Our sense is we're going to grow flat to low single digits in 2012. Sort of in the European theater, we're going to push that across both the Risk side and on the HR Solutions side. You know our commitment is to grow organically. And while there are headwinds out there, whether they're in pricing or economics or anything else, we're going to work hard to push against those and feel like we can do that in 2012.
Operator: Next question, Dan Farrell of Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the HR BPO business. This is a business that seemed like what it needed to do is get profitability fixed. It was not making much on a margin perspective, and now you're putting more into the business. Clearly, you must think of something that can be corrected very much on the margin but also grow, and I'm just wondering if you could talk about what trends you're seeing there that give you the increased confidence to invest in it and then also sort of what stage are we in the turnaround of that business from a margin perspective.
Christa Davies: Yes, so we would say we are very pleased with the progress in this business. New client wins are up significantly, and the performance in this business is exceeding our expectations. We would say that it is a low but positive margin business today, and it will get to a mid-teens margin by 2015, and we are well on that path. So it's growing organically as we saw in Q4, and we expect that trend to continue into 2012, and it's well on track to get to mid-teens margin by 2015.
Gregory C. Case: I might just also add, as you think about sort of the -- this is -- Christa's describing, literally, the core offering, and that's progressing very, very well, as she described. And we saw that, we anticipated that. We've seen that throughout the year, and the team's done a very good job on that front. But in addition to the core product, you might imagine there are lots of additional ancillary offerings that come with core HR BPO, on the Consulting side, in particular, and we're seeing that benefit as well, which is why we feel good about this business and look forward to continuing to grow it.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just one other quick question. I apologize if you've mentioned this already, Christa, but the pension contributions on a cash basis, are those even throughout next year? Are they more front-end loaded?
Christa Davies: They're fairly evenly throughout the year.
Operator: Next question, Adam Klauber of William Blair.
Adam Klauber - Macquarie Research: Could you talk about uses of cash next year? Are share repurchases still the priority? And as cash increases, do acquisitions, significant acquisitions become a possibility again?
Christa Davies: Yes, so the first thing I would say just to answer your M&A question is we do not believe there's a significant acquisition on the horizon. We believe M&A is going to be in the $200 million to $250 million a year range. It's traditionally smaller -- it's smaller acquisitions. So that would be sort of the M&A. But as we think about uses of capital and you refer to Slide 12 of the slide deck we posted, you can see that there are really sort of 6 main uses of capital: pension contributions, which is going to be $541 million in 2012 before any discretionary contributions; the second one is restructuring cash, which is $155 million in 2012; the third is CapEx, which is $270 million; and then we have sort of M&A, which I talked about, sort of $200 million to $250 million; which then leaves sort of return to shareholders of dividends and share repurchases. And obviously, we did over $1 billion this year. And as we think about uses of capital, return on capital on a cash-on-cash basis is the metric we use to allocate capital, and we think that share buyback is the highest return on capital across the firm. And frankly, if we look at our long-term growth of the business and hitting our revenue growth and long-term margin targets and uses of capital decreasing over time substantially, over the next 5 years, we actually see that the cash characteristics of the firm are going to grow substantially, and therefore, share buyback is even more attractive. As we think about sort of the right level of share buyback in 2012, it is going to remain our primary use of capital. $150 million a quarter is probably the right number to think about, with a lower number in Q1 because it's our lowest cash outflow quarter.
Operator: Next question, Jay Gelb of Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: On the Retail Risk Solutions business, as we get into a pricing environment here that moves into positive territory, how will clients react to that? Will they buy less coverage? And within the Retail business, how much of your revenue stream is commission-based rather than fee-based?
Gregory C. Case: So, what we've seen, Jay, is -- and again, we step back. We solve the risk issues, challenges of our clients, really, very holistically. So we actually help them balance both the cost of that, including the core pricing as well coverage, all the different pieces that go with that. And you'll see some adjustment. Certainly, it's a mitigating factor. As prices increase, clients think about it, but so is the range of coverage that they're having to think about now when you sort of think about all the traditional risks that our clients have to deal with now, adding to that kind of nontraditional risk and the impact of cyber risk and sustainability and all the different pieces that go with that. So for us, it's a pretty kind of holistic picture. On the margins, as prices change, it does impact kind of what happens with our book of business and mitigated by things, as you described, like client retentions. About 70% of our book is commission-based, and about 30% is fee overall. So if you think about that, so it's -- the changes in price will have an impact. But again, we look at it from purely a client perspective on how we can serve them best.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then on the reinsurance organic growth in the fourth quarter, how much of that should we consider recurring? I mean, it seems like a lot of these capital markets transactions are sort of onetime in nature.
Gregory C. Case: Well, as we described before, listen, the capital markets advisory businesses are lumpy. They go up and down. By the way, help us in some quarters, don't in other quarters. We just have an exceptionally strong capability here. When you think about what we're doing on the cat bond side and the capital advisory side, it's exceptional. We're the #1 player in the world leading the market. We're very much at the forefront there. Same on the advisory side, so that helps us. Facultative can be a bit lumpy, too, up and down. What I do want to emphasize is we feel good about our growth prospects, positive organic growth in 2012. And most important, as you reflect over the last few years in sort of the natural adjustment that occurs when you bring these 2 businesses together given our size, 2011, we believe, has set the stage very well in treaty, in capital advisory and, in fact, for growth.
Operator: Next question, Yaron Kinar, Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can we talk a little bit about GRIP, Aon Broking, Client Promise? How should we think about quantification of those both in terms of top line and maybe the margin impact?
Gregory C. Case: Well, if you step back and think a little bit, Yaron, about how we've talked about this overall, when you think about sort of driving performance in the Risk Solutions arena, the number of clients, how we're doing on new business, our wins, losses, et cetera, so we've got a great deal of focus around that, a lot of efforts around the Revenue Engine. We think about share of wallet, literally, what's the cross-sell, how many products are we selling, how are we doing it in a way that, again, back to Jay's question, is holistic and really represents the best interest of our clients. And then we look at yield per dollar of premium paid. Really, that's really the other piece that's absolutely critical in the context of this. And so all the initiatives you're describing kind of fit into that framework. And this is really back to kind of Christa's point on getting to the 26% now margin and how that's fixed your play out over time. And in our view, the investments we've made, which have been true investments, they have been drags on margin, are really starting to show what we thought they would and seeing progress on yield per dollar of premium placed on Aon Broking and on GRIP, as well as kind of client wins and losses sort of on the Revenue Engine. In Client Promise, by the way, it's been fantastic. We've been very pleased with sort of the results. When we do Client Promise surveys and really understand holistically how we performed, our retention goes up substantially and our new business goes up substantially. And again, we're just systematically listening to clients and responding with the full capabilities of Aon. And on the Aon Broking side and on GRIP side, as I described before on the yield per dollar of premium paid, we believe there's substantial potential here as we kind of organize our firm to deliver for clients. One great example is over the past few months, we've actually pulled out a kind of a the tranche of risk, call it middle market D&O, for private companies and been able to bring that to market in a way that we've got clients a much better outcome in terms of additions, et cetera, and in the context of that, also done well for Aon. So we have a high expectation for where we think this is going to go and continue to improve Aon's performance. All these things are in Christa's controllable categories, the first 3 she talked about. Those, by themselves, we believe, can get us to our target margin over time. And if we get helped by some tailwinds, either on the investment return side or on the pricing or insured value side, that actually accelerates it.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just so I understand, looking into 2012, would those be -- those initiatives, would those be a drag or a boost to margins?
Gregory C. Case: Yes, they're going to begin to drive up. So as we said before, through 2011, on the investments we've really made in kind of end of '09, '10, into '11, we said we'd really start to offer some potential in 2012, and we fully expect that to happen.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on the Benefits Administration business, clearly, you're still seeing some ongoing price compression and pressures there. Is that kind of the new normal for that business, or do you expect something to change there? And if so, what do you see the catalyst has been?
Gregory C. Case: Well, this has been as expected. This is a business, particularly on the large corporate side, that continues to experience compression, in line with what we thought as we came into the combination with Hewitt. But important, we take note of it. We really spend time with our clients to make sure we're helping them understand the value we can bring to the table, and we're getting paid for that, and we're delivering value. But we're looking for things evolving that capability into the middle market. Imagine middle market companies now that actually have much more compliance-related activities, they've got to come up to speed on, et cetera. We can actually help in the middle market. So the compression is real and meaningful, as we said before, offset by growth in new areas that we're trying to bring to bear to kind of offset that. But that really is what we're addressing as we go into 2012 and think about how we drive the business. So it's project revenue, what we're trying to do in the middle market, thinking about how we actually can continue improve productivity, things we call point solutions, which are specific targeted areas where we can help clients get better, Absence Management as an example of that. And so things -- those are the things we're trying to do, as we would always do, to improve the performance of the business through helping clients succeed.
Operator: Next question, Meyer Shields of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I was hoping you could take a couple of minutes and talk about year-over-year benefit or year-over-year changes in Aon Benfield's 1/1 renewals performance? I'm just thinking that that's particularly important over the course of the year. Just hoping to get some color on that.
Gregory C. Case: Yes. I would say, Meyer, we would describe it as -- we feel good about the program, the progress for our clients on the 1/1 side. You would, I'd expect, would have seen some movements, particularly in the cat-exposed areas of the world around the globe in which we have significant shares. What we're not doing now at this point is -- on the Aon Benfield side, we believe that the capability we've got puts us in a pretty unique position to serve clients. So we're actually not sharing detailed forecast in sort of what's happened in 2012. Again, cat-exposed zones are up around the world, but the policy we adopted was really not giving our pricing forecast. And the reason for this is our ability to deliver better prices per unit of cover is, we believe, unique in the industry. And so we don't want to -- we're not sharing that with anybody except our clients, and by the way, we're sharing it with them in some detail. But again, you can imagine the overall trajectories, particularly in the cat-exposed areas around the world.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: No, I understand that. I guess what I'm pushing for and may not get is performance for shareholders, in other words, how Aon Benfield felt it.
Gregory C. Case: Aon Benfield itself, I think the best way to grab that is looking at literally the win/loss. So you think about sort of net new clients won versus clients lost, and we're very pleased -- and as we expected, we believe once the overall set of adjustments were made as people readjust their books, which, by the way, in the insurance world, would take 18 months in the context of that because it takes 12 months to flow through. By the way, we actually do the recording of this. But our win/loss over the last 3 quarters has been up on a dollar basis and up on a client basis for 3 consecutive quarters as we're into 2011. We feel very good about that for 2012.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And one other question. I know with the restriction of the outside wholesale brokers, is there economic benefit that you expect in 2012 from that, or is that already in the books?
Gregory C. Case: Well, listen, the U.S. wholesale piece was really around serving clients more effectively, focusing around some preferred wholesalers who are bringing value to our clients in a very specific way, and we've got 2 who are in that category doing very, very well from our standpoint. And so it really is about how we serve clients more effectively and less about sort of the basic economics.
Operator: Our last question comes from Michael Zaremski of Credit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: In terms of the share buyback authorization, will you be waiting until the second half of the year, when the headquarters change is completed, to resume repurchases? And related, the tax guidance of 29% doesn't appear to show a tax benefit. Then I have a follow-up.
Christa Davies: Right. So on share buyback, I could say that I think $150 million a quarter is probably the right level, with a lower level in Q1 because it's a higher cash outflow quarter. That does not assume the relocation of headquarters, which would give us access to an additional $300 million sitting internationally on the balance sheet. In terms of -- so to answer you question, share buyback will continue throughout the calendar year, with Q1 being lower because it's our seasonally highest cash outflow quarter. Next, on the tax rate, we are giving guidance for 2012 of 29%. As we mentioned, the 27% we reported for 2011 had some onetime returns that will not continue.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, if I look at Slide 9, the Long-Term Operating Margin Targets, and tell me if I'm thinking about this the wrong way, if I strip out -- looking at the change in intangibles. So I look at the Risk Solutions operating margin target of 26% and I take out the intangibles, so it's still going to be 25%. And if I look at HR Solutions, it looks like it's 22%, but if I take out intangibles, it's 18%. So I'm just kind of curious, do the margin targets, x intangibles, go down incrementally all-in?
Christa Davies: No. This is literally a math equation just to back out intangibles and to account for the transfer of Health and Benefits. There's no change in our long-term margin targets.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Gregory C. Case: Yes, thanks very much, everybody, for participating on the call. We look forward to our next discussion. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded, and that it's important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website.  Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Corporation. You may begin.
Greg C. Case: Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. To begin, our underlying results reflect strong performance in our Risk segment, delivery of synergy savings related to Aon Hewitt, and the repurchase of 175 million of common stock. And while not satisfied with our organic revenue performance in HR Solutions, and I'll discuss more of that in detail, we continue to execute against our long-term strategy to substantially strengthen the firm for long-term growth and value creation.  Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is continued areas of investment across Aon; and third is overall organic growth performance.  On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share. In the third quarter, organic revenue was 1% overall, highlighted by strong growth of 4% in our Retail Brokerage business. Adjusted operating margin decreased 180 basis points driven by the inclusion of Hewitt results, including a significant increase in intangible amortization expense, which had a 220 basis point negative impact. EPS increased 13%, driven by strong underlying performance and effective capital management. Overall, a quarter of continued progress against our key metrics as we remain focused on our long-term strategy. On the second topic, further areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid, long-term operating performance combined with expense discipline and strong cash flow continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities. Just a few examples. In Risk Solutions, we continue to invest in innovative technology, such as our Global Risk Insight Platform, which is the world's leading global repository risk and insurance placement information. We now have 1.2 million trades in more than 59 billion of bound premium and a growing client list of more than 20 insurance carriers utilizing the platform analytics and services capabilities. Also, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, resulting in better economics for all participants. As highlighted by a significant D&O program of more than 175 million in premium, we're placing in the market on behalf of clients. We're also investing in additional capability and talent through recently completed acquisitions such as Aon Grieg in Norway and Glenrand in South Africa, significantly strengthening our international footprint. A final example is our investment in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency, with the rollout of the revenue engine in EMEA and Asia Pacific, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates as clients gain better understanding of our value proposition.  As we discussed previously, we are proving the concept of these investments in 2011, and as we move into 2012 and 2013, we're going to continue to drive greater scale and increased operating leverage as a result of these investments in our Risk business.  In HR Solutions, we continue to strengthen our industry-leading position in both public and corporate healthcare exchanges, with the significant investment we're making in our Aon Hewitt Navigators business, enabling clients to prepare for ultimate changes in healthcare legislation with design, purchasing and administration capability. We're also expanding our capability in compensation consulting. With the recent acquisition of Ward Financial Group, a leading provider of benchmarking for insurance carriers in North America. We're also expanding our international footprint as the workforce has increasingly becoming more global, with investments in key talent and capabilities across Asia.  And finally, we're continuing to invest in expanding our core HR BPO offerings through point solutions opportunities, such as dependent eligibility audits and absence management diagnostics.  In summary, as we focus on the long term across Risk and HR Solutions, our fundamental client-serving capability continues to substantially strengthen around the globe.  Finally, on the third topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 3%, with improved rates of organic revenue in each business despite soft pricing, excess capital and fragile economic conditions globally. Against these headwinds, which are primarily market-related, we're driving a set of initiatives that continue to strengthen our performance and give us confidence that our Risk Solutions business is firmly positioned for long-term growth and leveraged to an improving economy. With the management of our renewal book portfolio through Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction.  New business generation of more than $250 million across our Retail business, with solid growth across many markets including China, Latin America, Africa, New Zealand, Middle East, Ireland, Italy and U.S. Retail just to name a few, highlighting the strength of our global client-serving capability. Investments in new product and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP, Aon Broking and Client Promise. An improved win-loss trends in our core treaty reinsurance book of business that have now been positive for the last 2 quarters.  Turning to the individual businesses. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4%. Exposure units were relatively stable, pricing continues to be soft, down low-single digits on average, albeit at a moderating rate of decline. We also saw growth across all regions as a result of strong management of the renewal book of business in Latin America, U.S. Retail, solid growth in new business in Canada as well. A really, really solid performance overcoming soft market conditions and continued sector weakness in areas such as commercial construction and financial services, where we got leadership positions. On the international front, organic revenue growth was also 4%. Pricing continues to be flat to modestly down on average, with firmer pricing in cat-exposed regions. We saw strong growth in New Zealand and across Asia, including double-digit growth in areas such as Thailand, Taiwan and China. We saw a modest growth in U.K. Retail and EMEA as exposures are generally stable, but economic conditions remain fragile across many core markets in Continental Europe.  In reinsurance, organic revenue declined 1%, a modest improvement from Q2. Results reflect the 2% decline related to facultative transactions, partially offset by 1% growth in capital markets and advisory businesses in our international treaty placements. In our core book of treaty reinsurance, which represents 85% of revenues, we saw a 2% negative impact from the market as pricing was flat to down modestly on average, with firmer pricing in cat-exposed regions and higher seen retentions as clients retain more risk. And while market impact remains negative, the underlying strength in treaty reinsurance continues to improve. As net new business was up 2%, reflecting continued improvement from a negative 3% in Q4, flat in Q1, and now plus 2% in Q2. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we would note that the prior year quarter was a particularly strong quarter for capital markets transactions. While our pipeline is encouraging, the timing of capital market transactions, as well as facultative transactions can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. If certain transactions are pushed out, we'd expect a modest decline from this quarter's results, with the reverse being true of the transactions that are completed in the quarter. Overall, we continue to be encouraged by the underlying trends in the core treaty book, and we'd expect to see modest growth overall in 2012 if trends continue. Turning to HR Solutions. Overall organic revenue was negative 2%, a modest decline from flat in the prior quarter and a disappointing result compared to our previous expectations for modest improvement. Primarily due to 2 factors: Lower project-related revenue in Outsourcing and weaker results in EMEA in Consulting. Turning to the individual businesses. In Outsourcing, organic revenue was negative 2% compared to flat to the prior quarter. We saw positive growth from new client wins in both Benefits Administration and HR BPO, partially offset by price compression within expectations, suggesting continued strong underlying client performance. However, results were primarily impacted by a $13 million decrease in project-related revenue as the prior year quarter reflected strong performance, including support from multiple M&A transactions that didn't repeat at the same level this year. In addition, the quarter included $4 million related to a onetime adjustment of business in Canada.  As we look to the fourth quarter, we'd expect less pressure from project-related revenue resulting in modestly improved organic revenue performance from the third quarter's results. In Consulting Services, organic revenue was a negative 2% compared to flat in the prior quarter. In the U.S. and Canada, we continue to see pressure in both Health and Benefits Consulting related to unemployment levels and in Communications Consulting from lower discretionary spend. Additionally, significant uncertainty in the third quarter surrounding economic conditions in EMEA drove lower-than-anticipated results in our Health and Benefits Consulting business. Partially offsetting these weaker results were solid growth in Asia Pacific, in Global Compensation Consulting and Investment Management Consulting, all areas where we continue to invest and see good, long-term growth opportunities. As we look to the fourth quarter, we'd expect Consulting to deliver modest organic improvement from the third quarter's result.  Overall, I want to emphasize, we are not satisfied with our growth performance. While we expect economic conditions to remain fragile in the short term, against these headwinds, we're driving a set of initiatives that continue to strengthen our underlying performance and give us confidence that our HR Solutions business is positioned for improved long-term growth and leveraged to an improving economy. With solid new business generation, with over 160 wins including more than 20 new large and mid-market benefits administration wins and a very significant recent win in a large leading financial institution in HR BPO. A high degree of recurring revenue across HR Solutions with strong renewal rates, highlighting strong client satisfaction and continued investments in international markets, we were seeing double-digit growth in Investment Management Consulting and in new products and services such as our Aon Hewitt Navigators Healthcare Exchange business. In summary, our solid performance in Risk reflects the strength of our industry-leading platform and continues progress against our long-term strategy. And we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening the underlying performance and positioning HR Solutions for improved organic growth over time.  With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies: Thanks very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our third quarter results reflect continued progress to strengthen our industry-leading position and client-serving capabilities across Risk and HR. While we're firmly on track for growth in 2011, we are not satisfied with our organic growth performance year-to-date. Against this challenge, we are managing expenses, driving operational initiatives, delivering savings from our restructuring program and effectively allocating capital as highlighted by the repurchase of 175 million in common stock in the quarter. Now let me turn to the results of the third quarter. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, was $0.69 per share for the third quarter, up 13% compared to $0.61 in the prior year quarter. The inclusion of Hewitt results, combined with strong underlying performance and effective capital management more than offset a $61 million increase in intangible amortization expense and shares issued in the prior year for the Hewitt transaction. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 include $26 million of restructuring charges and $22 million of transaction-related Hewitt costs. Lastly, foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $0.03. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a very modest favorable impact to EPS in the fourth quarter.  Starting in the first quarter of 2012 and going forward, the company will begin providing adjusted results that excludes the impact of noncash intangible asset amortization and continue to exclude certain onetime items such as restructuring charges. We believe the exclusion of noncash intangible asset amortization will more closely align external audiences and the company around cash flow generation, and with how we think about capital management and shareholder value creation for cash-on-cash returns. As our required uses of cash decline over the next several years and free cash flow improves, we expect it to be significant source of value creation for shareholders. Now let me talk about each of the segments.  In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, and we delivered an operating margin of 19% on an adjusted basis, up 110 basis points from the prior year quarter. Our performance for the quarter continues to demonstrate strong operational discipline and underlying structural margin improvement, positioning the segment for greater operating leverage as growth and economic conditions continue to improve around the globe. On an adjusted basis, operating income increased 16% or $42 million to $308 million. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by an increase in organic revenue performance and modest benefits from the restructuring program. Let me spend a moment on each of the restructuring programs. Key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. With respect to the 2007 restructuring program, we've incurred 100% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings. Restructuring savings in the third quarter are estimated $134 million compared to $125 million in the prior year quarter. Approximately $113 million of the savings were related to the Risk Solutions segment, primarily for workforce reduction.  With respect to the Aon Benfield restructuring program, we have incurred 83% of the charge necessary to deliver the remaining savings. Restructuring savings in the third quarter are estimated at $30 million compared to $27 million in the prior year quarter. Overall, we are ahead of the original schedules and have delivered structural margin improvement. We have completed nearly all of the programs as of the end of the third quarter, with approximately $29 million of incremental Risk Solutions savings still to deliver. As remaining restructuring savings continue to wind down, the following 3 areas of margin opportunity are within our control and continue to put us on track toward delivering our long-term target of 25% in Risk Solutions: #1, operational efficiency and remaining restructuring savings; #2, continued rollout of a revenue engine; #3, higher-margin, GRIP-related and Aon Broking initiatives. In addition, there are 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant operating leverage based on improvements in the external market; #4, an improving global economy in areas such as employment levels, asset values and corporate revenues will drive leverage through exposure growth, along with every 100 basis point rise in short-term interest rates, delivered the roughly $40 million to the bottom line; and fifth, improvements in insurance pricing. Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue declined 3% and we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 11.2% as results reflect the merger with Hewitt, including a $61 million increase in intangible asset amortization. To further assess the underlying performance of operating income and margin in the segment, we believe it's useful to add together results of both Hewitt and Aon Consulting in the prior year quarter to form your starting point of the analysis. For example, if we take Hewitt's adjusted operating income of $110 million plus $55 million for Aon Consulting, your combined total is $165 million of operating income as reported for the prior year quarter. If we subtract additional intangible amortization expense of $61 million, this leaves an underlying $104 million of operating income. Comparing $104 million to the $125 million we reported in the third quarter, the increase in operating income reflects approximately $63 million of total restructuring and synergy savings, partially offset by lower organic revenue growth, including a $35 million decline in project revenue, $10 million of onetime items related to certain write-offs and a significant investment in our Aon Hewitt Navigators business.  Lastly, for the HR Solutions segment, I wanted to give an update on the Aon Hewitt restructuring plan and a brief comment on integration. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $26 million of charges in the quarter, primarily related to workforce reduction and lease consolidation. The Aon Hewitt restructuring plan is expected to result in cumulative cost of $325 million through the end of the plan, primarily encompassing $180 million in workforce reduction and $145 million in real estate rationalization costs.  Cash costs are expected to be approximately $275 million. Savings related to the restructuring program in the third quarter are estimated at $37 million, with additional synergy savings achieved outside of the formal restructuring program. We expect to deliver total annual savings of $355 million in 2013, including approximately $280 million of annual savings related to the restructuring plan, an additional savings in areas such as information technology, procurement and public company costs. We are on track to deliver our 2011 target of approximately $242 million of annual savings. These savings are the first of 3 key drivers for delivering our long-term operating margin target of 20% in HR Solutions. The other 2 key drivers are growth in the core business, including HR BPO improvement and declining intangible amortization expense beginning in 2013. Lastly, as we continue to make investments in our talent and capabilities, we are also making investments in certain back-office systems such as our Order-To-Cash platform. With any IT integration there can be challenges and during the third quarter, we had some temporary delays in invoicing certain clients in North America. However, this issue had no material impact on the results of the third quarter and we expect will be corrected over the next 2 quarters, resulting in a better end-to-end cash platform across the combined businesses. Now let me discuss certain line items outside of the operating segments. Unallocated expenses were $44 million. The prior year quarter included $18 million of costs related to the merger with Hewitt. Excluding those costs, unallocated expenses increased $13 million due primarily to a onetime $11 million unfavorable mark-to-market on certain company-owned life insurance plans.  Interest expense increased $10 million to $60 million due primarily to an increase in debt outstanding following the merger with Hewitt. Other income of $7 million in the third quarter includes gains related to the company's ownership in certain insurance investment funds and other long-term investments. The prior year quarter included an $8 million loss from the sale of certain businesses. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $5 million per quarter of interest income, $35 million of unallocated expense and $60 million to $65 million of interest expense per quarter. Lastly, minority interest was $10 million compared to $3 million in the prior year due to stronger performance of our joint ventures and partnerships primarily in emerging markets. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations declined to 28.9% in the third quarter compared to 29.4% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to certain deferred tax adjustments. The company anticipates an effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations of 29% for the fourth quarter.  Turning to shares. Average diluted shares outstanding increased to 336.9 million in the third quarter compared to 282.2 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to the issuance of 61 million shares of common stock related to the merger with Hewitt, partially offset by the company's share repurchase program. Actual common shares outstanding on September 30 was 323.3 million, down 3.4 million from 326.7 million at June 30. There are approximately 12 million of diluted stock equivalents. The company has approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase program previously authorized in 2010. Now let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow statement to discuss the financial flexibility. On September 30, cash and short-term investments were $902 million and total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion. Overall debt-to-capital was 35.6% at September 30, compared to 34.9% at June 30. Cash from operations, excluding change in funds held on behalf of clients which has no impact on cash, increased $296 million to $368 million in the third quarter, compared to $72 million in the prior year quarter. Stronger cash flow was driven primarily by the inclusion of Hewitt results, along with improved operating performance and lower working capital requirements, partially offset by restructuring-related cash payments and pension contributions.  Year-to-date, cash payments related to restructuring were $131 million and the company anticipates another $80 million of cash payments in the fourth quarter. Cash payments related to restructuring are expected to decline approximately $65 million to a total of approximately $146 million in 2012 before declining further in 2013. Regarding our unfunded pension plans, year-to-date contributions have been approximately $390 million, and the company anticipates contributing another $90 million in the fourth quarter. Because we close plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and de-risk certain pension plan assets, pension expense is much less volatile. Despite weak equity and AA corporate bond portfolio performance year-to-date, we would not expect to see any meaningful impact to pension expense either up or down in 2012. In summary, we delivered 1% organic revenue, placing us firmly on track for growth in 2011 despite fragile economic conditions and a continued soft market. We are managing expenses, driving operational initiatives across both segments and fully on track to achieve our long-term operating margin targets. We have significant leverage to an improving global economy. Our balance sheet and strong cash flow continue to provide significant financial flexibility as we repurchased $175 million of common stock in the quarter, highlighting our belief in the underlying strength of the firm.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Keith Walsh, Citi.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I really want to focus on Consulting as Brokerage was pretty solid. So just thinking about Consulting, minus 2 organic. Maybe you could split out for us how much of that is really related to the macro environment and how much related to attrition from the integration? And I've got a couple of follow-ups.
Greg C. Case: Sure. Happy to do that, Keith. Let me -- and I'll kind of give you the clinical read on this. But overall, let me start with just a perspective. We said, as we worked to build our business over the years, irrespective of economic conditions, we focus on growing and building our business, period. And by the way, we're making a lot of investments to do that. And those investments not only effect the top line, they impact the bottom line too. And at the end of the day, the full responsibility for growing the business is on me and on our team, and we just -- we've got to do better operationally. We are very confident in the plans, we'll take you through those in a second. But we just got to do better operationally. And if you think about sort of clinically what happened, a lot of this was economic headwinds. There was a greater economic headwinds in EMEA and in the U.S. In EMEA in particular, the conditions got worse. Basically, a lot of uncertainty in EMEA as you'd expect right now, and that led clients really to defer a lot of discretionary spend. In the U.S., poor conditions remain. We thought they did a little better, they didn't. And the resulting impact showed up really in one area or 2 areas in particular. One was in project-related revenue. On the Outsourcing side, it was down substantially. And this is the area, Keith, that really is discretionary spend. Things like support for M&A or benefits changes, et cetera. And in the end, that's a significant amount over time. $13 million, $14 million, that's a significant amount in terms of the impact. It also showed up the state of the economy around health and benefits on the Consulting side, particularly on health and benefits brokerage in EMEA. And then there were couple of onetime items that aren't going to reoccur, that also flowed through as well. But to your question, this is all around sort of the overall part of the business in the end. Unfortunately, it's happening at the time when the core business is doing quite well. And from an integration standpoint, we see Consulting growth in the multiple areas: Asia Pacific, global comp, investment and Consulting, Outsourcing growth has been very, very positive. In terms of new business wins, we actually we're doing -- we've done better in this quarter than we've done maybe -- in any time over the last number of years. And then the synergy capture, as Christa described, was very, very good. In fact, on or ahead of track. And so from our standpoint, this has been a lot of the reaction to the economy in Q3, but I want to be absolutely clear, that's not an excuse. There really is, as I said at the beginning, this is on me and on our team, and we said we're going to grow our business irrespective of economic conditions. We expect modest improvement in Q4, and we're looking to that, and we're just going to push through and keep driving the business. But the core thesis is incredibly positive and incredibly strong.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then for Christa, you alluded to being ahead of target on the restructuring savings. Can you actually push those cost saves forward quicker to offset some of this underlying margin deterioration you're getting out of Consulting right now?
Christa Davies: I mean, Keith, we do believe that we are on track if slightly ahead of our original restructuring plans. So we said we would deliver $229 million to $242 million of savings in 2011. And we delivered $42 million in Q1, $58 million in Q2, $63 million in Q3. So $163 million year-to-date. So we believe we're well on track to doing that. And we did have the $355 million of total savings. Really fast forward those savings to really sort of set the business up and really focus on growth. So I think we do believe that we will continue to improve performance and we're very focused on it, given the disappointing results in this quarter.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then last question for Greg, just in my words, I guess, second deal, I guess, done here with probably less than optimal results. I know it's early days but so far -- and we seem to be tracking below the glide path implied when this deal was announced. And I want to know what specifically is the management team doing to get us back on that glide path? And then in conjunction with that, why don't we get the operating heads of this business on the call? I think you're the only broker out there that doesn't do that. So if you can address those things.
Greg C. Case: Well, Keith, in stepping back, as we thought about Aon Hewitt, we're now a year into this. We could not be more pleased with the underlying basics of what we pulled together. The underlying client-serving capability is literally the best in the world. The client reaction has been incredibly positive. Our new client wins are doing exceptionally well as we look at what the growth of the business over time. The integration has gone incredibly well. And, Keith, from our standpoint could not have gone better. Not only in the synergy capture, but also how the teams come together. So we would say the underlying client-serving capability is exactly what we expected. The performance on the Outsourcing side and the Consulting side at the core level exactly are better than we expected. And in the end, we've got economic headwinds that are substantial. And as I said, no excuse. We've got to deliver against those headwinds and we will do that. And we've got the investments in place to make that happen. And we are as confident as ever about Aon Hewitt and the prospects for this business in the future. So from our standpoint, we couldn't be more pleased. There is a lot of -- a lot have happened over the period of building the business, we're in the process of doing that and we're quite excited about the future in terms of what we're trying to do. And in terms of colleagues on the phone, you can imagine our colleagues have a great deal of input into this call in terms of what we do over time. And so in many respects, what you're hearing through Christa and I are very much reflected in the management team's approach and the view on the business.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I appreciate that. But it's important to hear from the people actually on the ground running the business day-to-day especially for a piece of the business that has become such as an important part of your company. So just more of a suggestion. But thanks for your time.
Greg C. Case: Well, I appreciate that, Keith. We'll take it into consideration and I want to make sure we answer any and all question you got in terms of what we're doing day-to-day.
Operator: Next question, Adam Klauber, William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Also following up on Hewitt, it seem like sequentially, the expenses in Hewitt, even excluding the restructuring were up over 5%, 6%. I guess, what was driving that?
Christa Davies: Yes, talking to the foreign currency impact there as well, Adam, which we can sort of breakout. But we don't see sort of abnormal expense growth. What you see in the sort of the margin impact is a significant impact from intangibles. So intangibles had a 550 basis point impact on HR Solutions margin in the quarter. We do see expansion, as I said, from restructuring. The restructuring and other additional savings flowing through. And then really, the sort of the 3 things I noted in my script that impact margins of about $42 million in the quarter were an organic revenue impact to about $22 million, onetime items of about $10 million and the investment at Aon Hewitt Navigators of about $10 million.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And, Greg, if you could give us sort of an outlook on the P&C rate environment going to 2012? Obviously, there's been a lot of noise about moderate bottoming and even some improvement. I guess, how would you characterize the market?
Greg C. Case: Yes. I would say from our standpoint and, again, we look at this very analytically in terms of sort of what we see happening with the market over time. We would go back and essentially say, it is tightening. But we certainly haven't seen the turn. We were down roughly -- when we look at our GRIP platform overall, and this is literally the placements we make around the world, we were down roughly 5% in Q4 2010, about 4% in Q1, 3% in Q2. What we saw in this quarter was about down 2%. So exactly as described, we are down but at a lesser and lesser rate, which is tighter than it's been in quite some time. And then on the reinsurance side, we're seeing essentially, getting closer to flat as well. But certainly there remains a supply and demand imbalance on capital. And from that standpoint, we're flat to down slightly there. So that's how we see the rate outlook modifying a bit. But we would still say that it's slightly negative to flat.
Operator: Next question, Yaron Kinar, Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I have a question, the first question would be on the Risk Solutions margins. On the last call, we discussed, I'm looking at them on a year-over-year basis or calendar-year basis, do you still feel like you'll be able to grow those margins in 2011 relative to 2010?
Christa Davies: Yes, so as we look at year-to-date margins, excluding the Paris lease and macro factors effect, we think we're about flat year-to-date, and we do believe that we will grow our margins in Q4.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. So in doing that calculation, really, we're excluding the onetime items of the first half...
Christa Davies: Right. Yes.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And then can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the life insurance plans, what they are? Will they have any impact going forward assuming that the markets stays flat where it is today?
Christa Davies: I mean, there obviously life insurance plans that the company owns that have a mark-to-market impact, assuming the market doesn't change, then the mark-to-market would not change.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Right. But, I guess, I was a little bit surprised to see that the company owns them. As what part of the operations does it own them?
Christa Davies: I mean, it was 11% -- sorry, $11 million in the quarter and it hasn't had a material impact previously, and we don't expect it will going forward.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Is it part of the investment portfolio?
Christa Davies: Yes. I mean, it was a set of insurance policies taken out quite some time ago, almost 10 years ago. And then sort of, they're flowing through.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then I know you spoke a little bit about the reinsurance platform and the headwinds there or still facing it. Now that we do see better growth with some of your major competitors, when do you think that the spread between you and the competitors will start declining?
Greg C. Case: Well, we feel good about progress on the individual [ph] front. Again, if you step back and think about our reinsurance platform, we wouldn't trade it for any in the world. As we brought Benfield into the fold, we -- and back to the kind of the idea of the deal model and sort of our original thesis behind bringing the firms together. We are absolutely on track on how we brought them together, and absolutely on track in building that business. And as we watched it evolve over the last, think about the last 4 quarters, and think about net new business versus lost business, it essentially has gotten better each of the last 4 quarters. So negative in 2010, negative in 2011, slightly positive in the first quarter in '11, positive in the second, third quarter of '11. So the last 4 quarters, the trend's gotten better and better each quarter. And it really reflects the underlying value that we bring to clients. When we line up our analytics and we help them understand how we can improve their return on invested capital for our insurance carriers and our clients here, we win new business, and that's what we've done. Some of the discrepancy, as you think about the size of our business versus some of the other competitors out there, as there were adjustments in the first 18 to 24 months, they made big differences for other competitors. And for us, they were just literally part of bringing the 2 firms together, but now we are on a very strong track. The treaty business is growing, and it grew this quarter as well and feel very good about the trajectory of Aon Benfield.
Operator: Next question, Brian Meredith, UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple of questions here for you. First, I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on the impact of pricing at Aon Hewitt, and exactly kind of what's going on? Is that price decreases you're taking to try to retain the business? Could you talk about that a little bit and what the impact on margins is?
Christa Davies: Absolutely. So first of all, in terms of Aon Hewitt, we obviously do have pricing impact in the benefits business in particular that's been very stable, Brian, for the last full 12 months, so every quarter. And it's been exactly in line or actually slightly better than what we have originally modeled in our deal model. And that's being sort of offset by better win-losses. So we are winning more than we're losing, and that win-loss ratio is improving year-over-year. So we feel good about the underlying health of that business.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: But I just want to understand, so prices are going down, right?
Christa Davies: And they have been for quite some time and it's been at a very steady rate.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, great. And then the second question, Greg, wonder if you could talk a little bit about GRIP? Maybe take up rate we've seen so far, success with respect to commission leakage and that kind of stuff?
Greg C. Case: Happy to do that, Brian. If you step back, we said, GRIP is really part of our overall Aon Brokering strategy, and if you think about sort of the way that's going to impact our business. We have -- we think about sort of winning new clients, we're doing more with those existing clients and increasing the yield per dollar of premium placed. GRIP is really part of the overall Aon brokering strategy that helps us do that. When we put GRIP in place almost 3 years ago now, what we're really looking forward is trying to really understand our insurance -- our placements is better than anyone in the world could possibly do, and GRIP has allowed us to do that. In addition, it allows us to help our insurance carriers think about how they can improve their placement, whether -- how they target their placement, how they accomplish that, and we've been able to do that. We've got 20-plus partner markets who are part of this platform, who are finding it very, very effective and helping them actually identify how they grow their business and build their business, and it's been very effective. And as we said, it would be proven in 2011, we think we've more than done that and really scaled up in '12 and '13, and we are fully on track for that.
Operator: Next, Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: One clarification, as far as the savings go from the Aon Hewitt restructuring, I think you said on the call it was $63 million. But in the press release, I see a number of $37 million. What's the difference?
Christa Davies: Yes. So, Jay, we said originally that the $355 million of savings that we would achieve in 2013 would be comprised of $280 million in restructuring savings and about $75 million in additional savings. And so what you see in every quarter of this year is a restructuring savings number of $37 million in Q3 specifically, plus additional savings of $26 million, which gets you to a total of $63 million. And that's been happening this entire year, Jay. So in Q1, our total savings number was $42 million, of which $24 million was restructuring. In Q2, our total savings number was $58 million, of which $34 million was restructuring. And so that same pattern is flowing through.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And I guess, based on your view of the full year savings, we should expect to see a number north of $100 million in the fourth quarter of savings?
Christa Davies: No. We said we would be achieving total savings for calendar year 2011 in the $229 million to $242 million range. So you can see if we add Q1 plus Q2 plus Q3, we add to $163 million year-to-date.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it, okay. That's helpful. And then the -- it's a small number, but you mentioned a $10 million write-off at HR Solutions. What does that relate to?
Christa Davies: Right. So there are 2 different -- there 2 $10 million of onetime items. And $4 million of it, Greg mentioned in his script around a onetime adjustment to revenue and there's a $6 million onetime expense item, which adds to the $10 million impact in onetime items related to PCI in the quarter.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And I guess, one broader question, just quickly on HR. The HR Outsourcing business which is, I guess, a source of margin pressure historically for Hewitt. Can you give us a sense of what's happening there, that part of the plan was to improve those margins over time?
Christa Davies: Yes. In the HR BPO business, we are extremely pleased with the progress of that business. When Hewitt standalone reported, they had previously reported that business was a negative margin business. And on track to be a mid-teens margin business by 2015. We believe we are well on track with that plan.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Do you make -- you have positive margin on that business now?
Christa Davies: Yes.
Operator: Next question, Mike Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just one question on, related to HR benefits. So if you x savings and amortization, what is the benefit margin in the quarter and how should we be thinking about that?
Christa Davies: Yes. So we don't breakout specific benefit margins, Michael. But what I can do is say, if you look at Aon Consulting in Q3 2010, that number was $55 million. If you look at Hewitt in Q3 2010, that number was $110 million. So you start off with a starting point to Q3 2010 of $165 million. You subtract intangible amortization increase of $61 million, you get a starting point to Q3 2011 of $104 million. We obviously produced results of $125 million and the difference between those 2 numbers is, synergy savings is $63 million, which would get you at the sort of out of the $63 million to the $104 million to $167 million. And that difference between $167 million and $125 million reported of $42 million is made up of 3 items: The impact of organic revenue of minus $22 million; the onetime items I described of minus $10 million; and the investment in Aon Hewitt Navigators of $10 million.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. I'm just -- when I look at it and if I x those things out, it looks like for the last few quarters, it's been trending downward. So I'm just trying to understand, I mean, is the expectation, however you calculate it, the expectation that the number, that margin number for the third quarter, that's kind of where you expect margins to be at, that's you're kind of baseline and you're hoping to improve from there? Or I'm just trying to understand because it just seems like it's moving, just moving in one direction.
Christa Davies: Yes. We don't think they're moving downwards. I mean, the intangible margin impact in the quarter, it's 550 basis points. So it's quite substantial. Obviously, axe intangibles, the HR Solutions margin will be 16.7%. It's a very strong margin.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just one question. I wanted to understand back in the Risk business. See, you had a couple of relatively prominent acquisitions, international acquisitions, but the acquisition growth was negative in the quarter on the international side. So I'm just trying to reconcile those 2 points.
Christa Davies: Yes. They're pretty small acquisitions, Michael. So I mean, they're not really going to have a material impact in the quarter. Year-to-date, we've done about 5 acquisitions worth a little over $100 million. They're pretty small.
Greg C. Case: We're going to continue to look at tuck-in opportunities over the course of any given year. We've continue to do that, and we'll add content and capability where it make sense for us.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And just last one on the pension contributions, any guidance on pension contribution expectation for year end, given rates?
Christa Davies: So obviously, we have a year-end measurement date. So it's difficult to predict, but we would expect pension contributions to be up modestly for 2012. And then down every year after that to be fully funded on a GAAP basis by 2015.
Operator: Next question, Meyer Shields, Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I think we're beating this one to death. But when we look at the HR Solutions business, the combination of year-over-year increased amortization expense and I guess, underlying cost increases, what should we expect that to be sort of in the fourth quarter?
Christa Davies: For the fourth quarter? As we think about margin for the fourth quarter, what we would say is if you took that sort of $42 million and you kind of rolled it forward to Q4, that would have less impact in terms of negative organic, but we expect that it would be sort of modestly declining in Q4, and that we expect our investment in Aon Hewitt Navigators to continue.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. When we think about the pensions being, based on what we know now, flat on year-over-year basis, is that dollar or percentage?
Christa Davies: I'm sorry, Meyer, can you repeat that question?
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Right. You mentioned earlier in your comments that your expectation because of the de-risking you've done in the pension plans is that will be flat on a year-over-year basis. Is that as a percentage of revenue or dollars?
Christa Davies: That's in terms of pension expense. That's absolutely right, Meyer. But basically because of the de-risking we've done and the fact that we've closed the plans to new entrants and frozen the benefits, so we expect pension expense year-over-year to be flat.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And that's in terms of absolute dollars?
Christa Davies: Absolutely correct.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And last question if I can. With regard to the capital markets transaction, I understand that they're lumpy. Is there any help you can give us in terms of trying to understand, let's say, the fourth quarter of 2010 divergence from a normalized run rate in terms of margins?
Greg C. Case: Again, Meyer, just trying -- you're not coming through very strongly. So your question is around margin for Aon Benfield or...
Christa Davies: We did have significantly a higher capital markets transaction quarter in Q4 2010.
Greg C. Case: Got it. Sorry. So absolutely right. And as we said before, this is just both on the fact side and the capital markets side, they just tend to be a lumpy businesses. For example, our capital markets pipeline right now is exceptionally strong. We feel very good about it. But it depends on literally when the deals hit. If they hit in Q4, we're going to see some positive movement. If they don't hit and they defer to Q1. Then obviously, that has a bit of a variable impact. And all we're really trying to do is just highlight that for you in the context of the capital markets business, the fact business. That's just different from a patterning standpoint than what the treaty business is.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: No, I completely understand that. I think it's great that you're calling it out. I'm just trying to get a sense of what the margins would be if the fourth quarter of 2011 is and I'll put this in quote "normal" instead of above average like last year.
Greg C. Case: Our sense -- again, as we said before, if you go back and look at the overall Risk Solutions margin and how it's improving as Christa described, we see fundamental year-over-year improvement in the context of that. By the way, this is just part of our march toward 25%. We are making clear progress on that as we said in the last first and the second quarter. It's the same program. The same program we've had in place for the last number of years. It's exactly the same program that's literally given us roughly 100 basis point improvement every year for the last 5 years and that's the program here. And by the way, up or down from the standpoint of capital markets, that's not going to deter the progress on the march to 25%.
Operator: Next question, Matthew Heimermann, JPMorgan.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A couple of questions. Hopefully these are quick. But just -- I wanted to get -- just follow up on the compensation expenses and HR Solutions. I have -- if I adjust out FX, about a 2% growth in the numbers. And I'm just -- and that's adjusting for restructuring as well. So I'm just -- when you talk about the savings that you're seeing being in line, that number just feels a bit higher. So I'm just wondering, the investments that you're talking about for Navigators, as well as you mentioned I think Asia in the script, are those mostly people? Are those other things?
Christa Davies: Yes. But first of all, the investments we're making are mostly people that's right. But also your observation that base compensation expense is growing by 2% is roughly right. We have an inflationary push on our expense base of roughly 2%. And so as you think about the forces acting on the HR Solutions margin, you have synergy growth offset by intangible amortization. And for 2012, both numbers roughly match each other. And therefore, to expand margins year-over-year, you really need to have organic revenue growth sort of 2%, equal the inflationary expense-based push.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, I guess, I was getting 2% underlying adjusting out restructuring before adding in -- net of the savings, there was a 2% increase. And so that's where I'm struggling as I just relative to kind of the reinvestment expenses you mentioned for Navigators, it doesn't -- it feels like there's more push there than there should be.
Christa Davies: No. I think there may be other onetime things going on, Matthew, because that's not how we see the numbers. We do observe that there's an inflationary expense-based pushes I described, plus the investment in Navigators, and that is essentially the force that's acting on the margin other than the onetime item I described or the 2 items that impact PCI this quarter.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay maybe I'll follow up offline just to make sure my math is right. The second question would be just, can you talk about maybe what the pipeline looks like in HR Solutions from a revenue perspective versus what you're booking? And I just be curious, obviously, we had a deviation this quarter. But just wondering what the forward-looking like relative to the reported?
Greg C. Case: Yes. We want to highlight it, so you think about the deviation this quarter and again, something we've got to manage irrespective of economic conditions. But the deviation this quarter really was in -- primarily around areas of discretionary spend, things that you can actually push off, clients can actually make decisions to defer. But the core business back to kind of what we do in the core business around Outsource and the core business of what we do around Consulting has been very strong. So there's been no fall off on that. On the Outsourcing side, as I've said before, the win rates were as strong this quarter as they've ever been against competitors, and we feel very good about that the underlying intrinsics of the business now are progressing. And then this is now on top of the investments we've made. We've made a very explicit decision to invest behind Navigators and do it in a significantly way, because we think the opportunity is really almost unprecedented, given what's happening in healthcare in the world today. So we see the basic platform for growth is very strong. The investments we're making on top of it. We realize we've got margin paying in the context of doing that, but we feel like building the business for the long term. It puts us in a -- it's just another add to an already strong platform. So we feel very, very good about that. And if you look at 2012 revenue, we see it getting back to flat to slightly up in terms of what we're trying to do here. And again, I feel very good about the overall base business.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just more specifically, I mean, does that imply the pipeline is actually growing?
Greg C. Case: It does. And in fact, we've got a projected trajectory on the pipeline over the last year and we're doing very, very, very well on that.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess, the other question is, I mean, I actually think the Hewitt acquisition made a lot of sense, especially when you look at -- even though we're getting some deviations to return on capital. It still looks actually quite healthy. But I guess, what is a little bit concerning to me is the performance we're seeing is clearly a bit different than, at least to those of us in the outside are seeing, and there seems to be a gap between how we're perceiving the business and how you're talking about it. And I think, I guess, what do you think you can do to maybe bridge that gap? Because I think whilst the response that you're giving to questions are helpful to keep this point in terms of talking to people on the ground and also just in terms of the underlying data we have available to track your business -- being we're gaining less data today than we did with Hewitt broke out their businesses. Just what are some things you can do to maybe narrow that gap besides the passage of time?
Greg C. Case: No, I got -- and part of this, is be a little patient in the passage of time in the sense that if we come back, we have very specific set of fundamentals that we look at, and have looked at from the beginning around literally what's going to happen on the revenue side from a client development standpoint to your point around the pipeline and how's that's evolving. And really our fundamental client-serving capability. Can we look at clients in the eye and say, we can help you in a way that no one else can, identify that value, describe that value and actually deliver that value. And we've seen that actually be the case. And that's why the pipeline is in fact growing from a client development standpoint. And then on the cost side, can we take out and get the cost efficiencies that we had anticipated coming in and achieve that. And the answer on both of those fronts have been in fact stronger than we anticipated. Against those headwinds around discretionary spend, we saw a significant drop-off and that really is the disconnect. That's it. That is the disconnect. And by the way, the disconnect has real leverage in the context of what we're doing. If you underline -- if the amortization is roughly the synergy and we have underlying expense growth roughly 2%, as Christa was describing, then we need growth to get the positive operating leverage. To the extent we don't have that, we didn't have it this quarter, that's the impact you're seeing. But that literally is the -- that's the disconnect. What you hear from a positive standpoint is our confidence that we will build the business and continue to drive it forward, it's not unlike a conversation, this is most exactly like the conversation we had about Risk 4 years ago, when the questions is around what are we doing on the Risk front, how we are actually building that business and what are we putting in place to accomplish that. And now 4 years later, I think we've got a Risk business that really has a really strong platform with great growth prospects in the context of what we're doing, and the investments we're making to prove the value in 2011 or actually it's being proven and now driven -- going to be driven out in 2012, 2013. Now in Aon Hewitt, we've got a great team in place, great leadership team and tremendously strong platform, and we believe the healthcare issues in the world today and the pension issues in the world today are going to continue to go up and become more acute for our clients. So the enthusiasm you're hearing is very much around that set of intrinsics, which we think are quite strong. And we understand the concerns of this quarter and we want to make sure you're clear we're going to address those concerns, but there should be no question around the underlying strength of this platform. It's just exceptionally strong.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I guess, maybe I would suggest then, maybe there is some metrics similar to when you were turning around Risk, whether they're reported in the press release or made on the call that are somehow consistent maybe to help put some numbers around things to give us a better sense of how you're progressing versus the metrics. Because I guess maybe one of the issues we're struggling with is, it kind of feels like the goalpost keep moving, but part of that is we don't really know in an absolute sense where the goalpost should be set.
Greg C. Case: Great input. And as we will always do, input from all of you to take that in and actually come back with some views and perspectives on how to make sure you know exactly how the tracking is going as we look at it. So I appreciate the input.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Not a problem. And then, Christa, just a comment you made on the EPS change. Does that mean you're going to be providing a supplemental EPS number to what we're seeing already? Or are you going to completely redefine how you're...
Christa Davies: We're going to redefine adjusted EPS to exclude intangible amortization expense.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Could I make the suggestion? I think it would be helpful if you just provide a net addition. Because I think one of the -- we're all savvy enough financially to actually look at cash flow and let that drive our valuation. But I actually think losing -- moving further away from GAAP and how some of the peers report might not be as helpful as you think it may.
Christa Davies: I appreciate your input. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg C. Case: I just want to say to everybody, thank you very much for joining the call today. We appreciate it and your interest in Aon, and look forward to our next discussion. Thanks very much for joining today.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties this call is being recorded, and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Corporation. Sir, you may begin
Greg Case: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. To begin, our second quarter results reflect continued progress with solid growth in our Retail Brokerage business, delivery of synergy savings related to Aon Hewitt and the repurchase of more than 300 million of common stock. Consistent with our messages on previous calls, irrespective of the stock market, economic conditions or other challenges outside our control, we continue to execute on our strategy to substantially strengthen and unite Aon around the globe. Also consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review: First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is continued areas of investment across Aon; and third is overall organic growth performance. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share. In the second quarter, organic growth was plus 1%, highlighted by solid growth in our Retail Brokerage business, placing us firmly on track for growth in 2011. Adjusted operating margin decreased 220 basis points, driven by the inclusion of Hewitt results, including a significant increase in intangible amortization expense. EPS increased 2% to $0.83, driven by strong underlying performance and effective capital management. Overall, our team views the underlying second quarter results as a quarter of continued progress as we strengthen the firm for long-term growth and value creation. On the second topic, further areas of investments. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid operating performance combined with expense discipline and strong cash flow continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities. A few examples include, in Risk Solutions, we're invested in innovative technology, such as our Global Risk Insight Platform, which delivers unmatched data and analytics, new revenue opportunities and greater insights into our commission yields across $54 billion of premium flow globally. We're also investing in additional capability and talent, as well as strengthening our international footprint through recently completed acquisitions such as Glenrand in South Africa, which solidifies our position as the largest broker on the continent of Africa.  We're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the revenue engine in EMEA and Asia Pacific, the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention rates and ensuring clients understand our value proposition and the rollout of our Aon Broking platform to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk in any geography around the globe.  In HR Solutions, we continue to strengthen our industry-leading position in both public and corporate healthcare exchanges, enabling clients to prepare for ultimate changes in healthcare legislation with design, purchasing and administration capability.  We're expanding our capability in investment management consulting as highlighted by the acquisition of EnnisKnupp, complementing our incredibly strong U.K. business with over $4.3 trillion in combined assets under advisement. And we're expanding our international footprint as the workplace is increasingly becoming more global with investments in key talent and capabilities across Asia. Finally, we're continuing to invest in expanding our core HR BPO offerings through point solution opportunity such as dependent eligibility audits and assets management.  In summary, across Risk Solutions and HR Solutions, our fundamental client-serving capability continues to substantially strengthen around the globe. These investments, fully funded in the context of long-term margin improvement, position Aon very well to take advantage of an improving global economy and a long-term growth opportunity we see across our markets.  Finally, on the third topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue was plus 2%, a continuation of the positive trends we saw in the prior quarter despite soft pricing, excess capital and fragile economic conditions globally. Against these headwinds, which are primarily market-related, we're driving a set of initiatives that continue to strengthen our underlying performance and give us confidence that our Risk Solutions business is firmly positioned for long-term growth and leveraged to an improving economy. With management of our renewable book portfolio through Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction.  New business generation, more than $240 million across our Retail business with strong growth in many markets including China, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Italy, Denmark and U.S. Retail just to a name a few, highlighting the strength of our global client-serving capability, and investments in new products and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP, Client Promise and Impact on Demand and global growth in treaty reinsurance, driven primarily by net new business.  Turning to the individual businesses. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was plus 3%. Pricing continues to be soft, down low-single digits on average with relatively stable exposure units. But in spite of this headwind, we saw strong growth in both Latin America and in our Affinity products, partially offset by a modest decline in U.S. Retail and continued sector weakness in areas such as construction. However, for construction, despite continued weakness in this important sector, our team delivered a strong quarter of improved performance led by strength in the commercial surety business. We've got a great platform and a great team we plan to keep investing behind to position this business for substantial long-term growth.  On the international front, organic revenue growth is plus 3%. Pricing continues to be flat to modestly down on average with firmer pricing in cat-exposed regions. We saw strong growth in New Zealand and across Asia, including double-digit growth in areas such as Thailand, China and Japan, driven primarily by new business activity. We have modest growth in U.K. Retail and EMEA as exposures are generally stable, but economic conditions remain fragile across the region. In Reinsurance, organic revenue declined 2%. However, in the core book of Reinsurance, global treaty revenue drove a 2% increase in total organic revenue. The first quarter of growth in treaty Reinsurance since Q2 of 2009, driven primarily by improved trends in new business and less impact on the pricing side. Capital advisory and facultative placements, which are very much more transaction-driven, drove a 4% decline in total organic revenue as the prior year quarter included significant activity related to cap on [ph] placements.  As we reflect on the merger with Benfield, the transaction continues to perform better than our original expectations as the first 2 years were not as much about growth but about strengthening an unparalleled reinsurance platform with unmatched data and analytics, while delivering on the economics of the transaction, including $122 million in synergy savings that remain well ahead of the original schedule. We remain confident and excited about our capability in Aon Benfield.  From a pricing perspective, despite significant industry loss experience in the first half, we believe excess capacity globally will continue to drive soft pricing, albeit at a moderately lesser rate of decline with firmer pricing in certain cat-exposed regions.  Given these industry conditions for treaty business and the transactional orientation nature of the capital advisory and facultative placements, we would expect the trends in Reinsurance in the second half to modestly improve from the results in the second quarter. Turning to HR Solutions. Overall organic revenue was flat, a modest improvement from the prior quarter as fragile economic conditions placed pressure on corporate discretionary budgets and global unemployment trends. Against these headwinds, which are primarily market-related, we are, again, driving a set of initiatives that continue to strengthen our underlying performance and give us confidence that our HR Solutions business is firmly positioned for long-term growth and leverage through an improving economy, with a high degree of recurring revenue across HR Solutions with strong renewal rates, highlighting strong client satisfaction; solid new business generation with over 150 wins, including more than 20 new mid-market benefits administration wins and a very significant recent win in a leading large financial institution in HR BPO; and continued investments in international and emerging markets and in products and services, such as investment management consulting and healthcare exchanges. Turning to the individual businesses. In Consulting Services, organic revenue was flat, and the results reflect the modest decline from the prior quarter as fragile economic trends globally placed pressure on unemployment and discretionary spend. Solid growth in global compensation and investment management consulting was offset by impact of weak economic conditions in U.S. retirement and health and benefits consulting. And we'd expect modest organic growth in the second half similar to the first half.  In Outsourcing, organic revenue was flat and results reflect the modest improvement from the prior quarter. We saw a growth from new client wins in both Benefits Administration and HR BPO, as well as growth from point solutions in areas such as dependent eligibility verification. And we would expect flat to modest organic growth in the second half, a continued improvement from the first half. In summary of our second quarter results, we're delivering solid underlying progress against the key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Events occurring in Japan, Australia, New Zealand; our pending Health Care Reform in the U.S., just to name a few major developments, only reinforce the needs of our clients and the significant long-term growth opportunities for Aon as the industry leader in both Risk and HR Solutions.  I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review.
Christa Davies: Thanks very much, Greg. Good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our second quarter results reflect continued progress to strengthen our industry-leading position and client-serving capabilities across risk and people. We are firmly on track for growth in 2011. Against that, we're managing expenses, delivering savings from our restructuring program and effectively allocating capital as highlighted by the repurchase of $303 million in common stock in the quarter. Now let me turn to the results from the second quarter. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, was $0.83 per share for the second quarter, up 2% compared to $0.81 per share in the prior year quarter, as the inclusion of Hewitt results, combined with strong underlying performance and effective capital management more than offset a $62 million increase in intangible amortization expense and shares issued in the prior year for the Hewitt acquisition. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 include: a noncash charge of $19 million, resulting from the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the repaid term credit agreement, $14 million of restructuring charges and $5 million of transaction-related Hewitt costs.  Lastly, there were 2 items not adjusted for that are helpful in understanding the core results. First, a $16 million of other expense or $0.04 for reoccupying vacated leasehold properties in the U.K. and remaining lease termination costs for facility exits in France. And second, foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $0.03. If currency were to remain stable at todays rates, we would expect a modest favorable impact to EPS in the second half. Now let me talk about each of the segments. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 2%, and we've delivered an operating margin of 19.6% on an adjusted basis, down 140 basis points from the prior year quarter. Our operating performance for the quarter was primarily impacted by 3 items. First, as noted above, we incurred $16 million of lease-related costs or a 90-basis point impact that we do not expect to recur going forward. Second, low investment income impacted margin by 30 basis points. And lastly, foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted margin by 20 basis points, primarily resulting from a weaker U.S. dollar versus the pound. These 3 items, largely nonrecurring or macro-related, unfavorably impacted margins by 140 basis points in the second quarter. Excluding these items, our underlying performance for the quarter continues to demonstrate strong operational discipline and underlying structural margin improvement in a modest organic growth environment, positioning the segment for greater operating leverage long term as economic conditions continue to improve around the globe. Let me spend a moment on each of our restructuring programs, key initiatives that are enabling concurrent funding and investments, and delivering long-term structural margin expansion. With respect to the 2007 restructuring program, we have incurred 100% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings. Restructuring savings in the second quarter are estimated $134 million compared to $113 million in the prior year quarter. Approximately $113 million of the savings were related to the Risk Solutions segment, primarily for workforce reduction.  With respect to the Aon Benfield restructuring program, we have incurred 95% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings. Restructuring savings in the second quarter are estimated at $30 million compared to $24 million in the prior year quarter. I would note in the second quarter the reversal of $22 million of restructuring costs accrued in the prior period under the Aon Benfield and 2007 restructuring programs as a result of the company reoccupying vacated leasehold properties.  Overall, we're ahead of the original schedule on our 2007 and Aon Benfield restructuring program. We have completed nearly 100% of the charges as of the end of the second quarter with approximately $24 million of incremental Risk Solutions savings still to achieve in the second half of 2011. The following 3 margin opportunities are within our control and continue to put us on track in delivering our long-term target of 25% in Risk Solutions. The first, operational efficiency and the remaining restructuring savings; the second, continued rollout of the revenue engine globally; the third, Aon Broking and GRIP-related initiatives.  In addition, there are 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant operating leverage based on improvements in the external marketplace. The fourth, is an improving global economy in areas such as employment levels, asset values and corporate revenues, which will drive leverage through exposure growth along with every 100-basis point rise in short-term interest rates delivers roughly $35 million to $40 million to the bottom line; and fifth, improvements in insurance pricing.  Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue was flat, and we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 13.9% as a result to reflect the merger with Hewitt, including a $59 million increase in intangible asset amortization. To further assess the underlying performance of operating income and margin in the segment, we believe it's useful to add together results for both Aon Consulting and Hewitt in the prior year quarter to form your starting point of analysis.  For example, if we take Hewitt's adjusted operating income of $105 million, plus $47 million for Aon Consulting, your combined total is $152 million of operating income as reported for the prior year quarter. If we subtract intangible amortization expense of $59 million, this leaves an underlying $93 million of operating income. Comparing $93 million with $151 million we reported in the second quarter, the increase in operating income reflects savings related to the restructuring program, additional synergy savings and operational improvement. Essentially, we believe that strong operating income growth on flat organic revenue implies solid operating margin expansion in the HR Solutions segment. Lastly for the HR Solutions segment, I wanted to comment briefly on the Aon Hewitt restructuring program. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $31 million of charges in the quarter, primarily related to lease consolidation and workforce reduction. The AON Hewitt restructure plan is expected to result in cumulative costs of $325 million through the end of the plan, primarily encompassing $180 million in workforce reduction and $145 million in real estate rationalization costs. Cash costs are expected to be approximately $275 million. Savings related to the restructuring program in the second quarter are estimated at $34 million, with additional synergy savings achieved outside of the formal restructuring program. We expect to deliver total annual savings of $355 million in 2013, including approximately $280 million of annual savings related to the restructuring plan and additional savings in areas such as IT, procurement and public company costs. We are on track to deliver approximately $242 million of annual savings in 2011.  These savings are the first of 3 key drivers for delivering our long-term operating margin target of 20% in HR Solutions. The other 2 key drivers are growth in the core business, including HR BPO improvement, and declining intangible asset amortization expense beginning in 2013. Now let me discuss certain line items outside of the operating segment. Interest expense increased $30 million due to an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding following the merger with Hewitt. Other expense was $23 million in the second quarter, primarily due to a noncash charge of $19 million resulting from the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs associated with a repaid term credit agreement. The second quarter also included a $13 million loss related to the company's ownership in certain insurance investment funds, partially offset by $9 million of distribution from certain private equity securities.  Going forward, for these items, we would expect a run rate of approximately $5 million per quarter of interest income, $35 million of unallocated expense and $60 million to $65 million of interest expense per quarter. Due to better performance from our joint ventures, we expect minority interest to be in the $9 million to $10 million per quarter going forward. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 24.7% in the second quarter. The effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2011 was favorably impacted by the resolution of an income tax audit and certain deferred tax adjustments. The company anticipates an effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations of 29% for 2011. Turning to shares. Average diluted shares outstanding increased to 342.7 million in the second quarter compared to 282.6 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to the issuance of 61 million shares of common stock related to the merger with Hewitt, partially offset by the company share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30 were 326.7 million compared to 330.5 million at March 31. There are approximately 13 million diluted stock equivalents. The company has approximately $1.4 billion remaining under the share repurchase program previously authorized in 2010. As we think about buyback for the remainder of 2011, we believe it's incredibly important and expect it to be in the Q4 2010 levels.  Now let me turn to the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $815 million and total debt outstanding was $4.5 billion. During the quarter, we placed $500 million of 5-year notes, of which the proceeds were used to refinance part of the original $1 billion term loan, essentially lengthening the maturity and locking in a fixed rate. On June 15, we refinanced the remaining outstanding portion of our term loan of $450 million, essentially reducing the variable rate to LIBOR plus 137.5 basis points both of the historical rates of LIBOR plus 250 basis points. Overall debt to capital was 35% at June 30 compared to 35.3% at March 31. In summary, we delivered 1% organic revenue, placing us firmly on track for growth in 2011 despite fragile economic conditions and a continued soft market. We're managing expenses, driving operational initiatives across both segments and fully on track to achieve our long-term operating margin targets. We have significant leverage to an improving global economy. Our balance sheet and strong cash flow continue to provide significant financial flexibility as we repurchased 303 million of common stocks in the quarter, highlighting our belief in the underlying strength of the firm.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Walsh, Citi.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: I guess I'll just come right out and ask. I'm surprised there was little negative operating leverage at Brokerage however we want to adjust for the adjustments. But just thinking about it out loud, the pricing in the economy, not good, but certainly better than they were a year ago, and you still have cost saves flowing in. So I think this is probably a key area here where the misses versus my number, so if you could address that?
Greg Case: I'm happy to do that Keith. Let me -- I'll start with a little bit of context around the quarter, then, Christa, maybe, you could just drive in, give us specifics. First of all, overall, as we said, Keith, we're driving toward a commitment around a 25% margin with a detailed game plan in place to do that. That's fully on track. Everything is moving as expected. Q2, from our view, actually did nothing to change the view on that. I can see where you're coming from, as you look at the results. But as we look at behind the results and the overall game plan, as Christa described, 5 very specific elements are going to drive progress there and get us to that 25% margin. Three are in our control around restructuring, revenue engine, Aon Broking, those are progressing very, very well. We saw great progress in the quarter. Two outside of our control in interest rates in pricing and GDP growth. And we said all along, by the way, in addition to getting the 25% margin, we are going to simultaneously invest heavily in the business, which we continue to do in multiple places. That means, we're going to have, really from our standpoint, look at this year-to-year not quarter-to-quarter. And if you look at it year-to-year, as you know well, our record reflects reasonable progress. When you think about 2005 to 2010, we've increased margin 530 basis points, give or take. That's roughly a little over 100 basis points a year from 15.1 to 20.4, while simultaneously making all the investments that we've described before back into the business, fighting the headwind on pricing and rates and the economy, et cetera. So from our standpoint, we actually feel good, very good, about being on track for the 25%. Literally, nothing has changed in our mind in the context of that. And maybe Christa could describe, kind of, the quarter specifically. But overall, we feel very good about it. And importantly, to your question, really implied what's around do we have economic leverage to a changing economy? And we absolutely believe we do that, and again, nothing in the quarter in our mind changed that. But, Christa, maybe you can talk specifically about the quarter.
Christa Davies: Sure. First, we think about the resolution's margins, Keith, 21% versus 19.6%. There are really 3 items, we believe, that sort of either onetime or macro-related that impacted margin. 90 basis points for lease termination, 30 basis points for investment income and 20 basis points for FX. That's 140 basis points, essentially flat year-over-year, excluding onetime and macro-related items. And then if we think about sort of operating leverage going forward, which is really the heart of your question, I think there are sort of 3 things we would say that drive operating leverage going forward. One is the initiative we have around, sort of, revenue engine, improved productivity and expense management, essentially blocking and tackling. The second is really the return of the higher margin initiative we have around GRIP. And we've really said that they're going to flow through 2011, '12 and '13, and we certainly see those coming through. And the last one is really sort of leverage around exposure growth and pricing. We absolutely see positive leverage as we look out.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: And then my follow-up, just related to the first question and more specifically around Aon Benfield. Greg, I'm having a hard time understanding your comment that it's performing better than you've projected when you did the deal. When we got revenues down for 9 or 10 consecutive quarters versus Guy Carpenter and Willis Re, and I have to imagine your margins are being impacted by that, so maybe if you could just give me a little more color around that?
Greg Case: Yes, happy to do that, Keith. As we thought about literally, again, investing in the business and building our business for the long term, we've invested in content and capability. As we've done that, we want to make absolutely certain we do it in the context of being to drive margin improvement. And we've got a pretty good record of being able to do that. All I was reflecting is Aon Benfield has done exactly that. We knew we'd have growth pressure for the first couple of years. As we put the businesses together, we had some of that. But if you think about the economics of what's been returned of synergy savings, establishing the platform, within the context of that, that is done exceptionally well. In fact, beyond what we could have even hoped as we actually began the transaction. And now as we look to kind of where we are now, what we're essentially seeing is the 3 book grew in this quarter plus 2% as I described before. The win-loss ratio, as we've tracked them, is improving. We feel very, very good about that in the context of sort of growing the business overall. And so from our standpoint, as we reflect on it, all the economic returns have been there exactly as we'd hoped, in fact, better. And the underlying growth characteristic, as we reflect on this quarter and think about the second half of the year, feel very, very good about it. So from our standpoint, that was really what I was trying to reflect in my overall statement. And we see some upside as we think about sort of what's happening in the second half of the year and as things improve on the pricing front in the overall economy. So from our standpoint, we see the growth in the second half, and we know the underlying economic leverage we've got in the business.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: And maybe just one more quick one on that point. So are your margins up or down at Aon Benfield since when you did the deal? I guess that's what I really want to understand. And then how many -- when do we normalize on the revenue? It's been 2 years now, when do we normalize, and when do you start getting more of an average growth rate for the industry?
Greg Case: Yes, and as we've done historically, Keith, we talk about overall Brokerage margin. And as you can reflect, the Brokerage margin has increased in the margins 100 basis points a year for each of the last 5 years, including the last 2 years when we've included Aon Benfield in the context of it. So overall, Brokerage margin, again, back to kind of the forced march that we've been for the last 5 years irrespective of the economic external situation, internal situation, insurance pricing, our Brokerage margin has increased about 100 basis points a year including, including Benfield and all the characteristics and challenges you're having to bring businesses together. So we feel very good about the progress on our Brokerage margin. And again what creates some lumpiness is we're continuing to make significant investments, and that causes kind of the quarter-to-quarter lumpiness. And that's the trade-off we're always going to make, but it should not, in any way, shape or form, take away from what we believe is happening with our underlying Brokerage margin, which continues to go up. And we anticipate it will do to achieve the 25% target, which again, as I said before, we're completely on track to do. And we feel like we're about there from the standpoint on the normalized as you described, standpoint from the organic growth standpoint.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: So you're not going to tell me about Aon Benfield's margin specifically in the context of. . .
Greg Case: We're going to keep reporting what we always report, which is overall margin Brokerage margin, which, as I said before, is up.
Operator: Our next question, Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just a couple of quick ones here. The buyback page, you kind of reverted -- you're reverting back to the fourth quarter, kind of, $150 million a quarter. What about prices there? It looks like cash flow generation is pretty substantial. Is there another place you plan to channel that capital or the cash flow as you're generating it? And just one follow-up.
Christa Davies: So as we think about cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet, $815 million, you think about that splitting roughly half-half between the U.S. and international. And then you think about the uses of cash we have, Michael, which we have some substantial uses of cash this year, pension contributions, dividends. And so we're reflecting those in the comments where we really said that we think buyback for the second half of the year will look more like Q4 2010 levels as we determine the location of cash and the other uses of cash.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Got you, okay. And then just on the lease terms, when you call these onetime items I mean if we're trying to think about what margins look like from here, and I understand the kind of 25% goal and kind of moving in that direction, but how should we think about the back half of the year? I mean, are you going to have another lease termination charge? Are any of these onetime items going to be onetime items again in the third quarter or maybe the fourth quarter? How should we think about that?
Christa Davies: The first thing, I mean, to say on the lease termination, particularly the U.K. one this quarter, it's a very positive -- it's positive for cash flow, it's positive for GAAP results. It just happens to be an impact in terms of our adjusted results because of the way you -- reverse the restructuring charge and then flow the operating lease expense back through our adjusted results. So it is absolutely the right decision to be making for shareholders. As you think about adjusted margins in the second half of the year, I did say that we would not see lease termination impact in the second of the year. We do believe we're now at the end of this.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Got you. Okay, and then just this one, I guess, for Greg. I mean, you're kind of talking about being on track from where you were to where you want to go. How does the second quarter, kind of, margins in both segments, how do you think about that along that same path? I mean, are you -- when you back out these onetime items, it looks like we're about flat, but we're not kind of moving in a singular direction. It doesn't seem, at least from the numbers -- is there something underlying that maybe you can point to more specifically?
Greg Case: Yes. We can step back and think about this as we measure it over the course of the year and improvement year-to-year-to-year. And that's what I said before, we feel very confident about the progress. The record is clear and the progress going forward and the underlying things we see day-to-day in the business is why we are confident the Brokerage margin is going to continue to march forward. When you think about quarter-to-quarter, again, we would look at it as we are roughly flat for the quarter, as Christa described. And these are onetime charges. And again the leasehold improvement, things like that are literally things we do -- have done based on bringing Hewitt into the fold. They all make sense. They work from a shareholder's standpoint. We're always going to do that in the context of what we're doing. But structurally, the improvement in the margins is clear from our standpoint and is going to progress throughout the year. Again, it'll be higher in some quarters and lower in some quarters. This is why, by the way, you guys hear us, when you get really excited, when margins went up in the quarter, we say, it's going to vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. It's going to march forward just as it always had. And so for us, in Q2, roughly flat. We made some specific investments in content capability that we think will serve us very, very well going forward. You completely underscored our confidence that as the economy continues to hopefully improve in the fullness of time, we get great economic leverage in the context of that. So and as I said before, we feel very good about the progress on the Brokerage margin side as we think about tracking for the year, first piece. And on Aon Hewitt, as Christa described, what she really took you through was a very detailed breakdown of the operating performance at $1 level. You really don't have an apples-to-apples comparison on margin, which is why it really is almost irrelevant. If you go back and look at the specifics of exactly what happened on operating income in the context of Aon Hewitt, we feel quite good about the progress year-to-year. And when you think about sort of overall Q1 is up $43 million, Q2 is up $59 million from a synergy-capture standpoint, we are fully on track to do, in fact, ahead a little, to do exactly what we wanted to do in the context of driving margin improvement on Aon Hewitt. So that's why, in the end, we feel very good about sort of overall progress on margin on across both businesses and feel like we're very much on track irrespective of, kind of, the quarter-to-quarter ups and downs. Does that make sense?
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Yes, it does. I mean one last one if I just could. So is there anything in quarter that you would feel like didn't hit your expectations? Or is there something you think from an operational perspective you would've liked to have seen better or different?
Greg Case: Yes, I think from our standpoint, the thing that we want to continue to push on is organic growth. And while we saw a 3% organic on the retail side, we're going to keep pushing for more than that. It's been a number of quarters now. We're, kind of, in that category. But given the investments we really believe that, as Christa described, into 2012, we're going to see great leverage in the context of that. And then on the Benfield front, just as Keith highlighted, listen, we want to grow that business and drive that business. Obviously, our business is much larger than some of our counterparts, which reflects sort of changes when you think -- compared to the organic growth of the 2 businesses. But we saw a positive treaty growth in this quarter, which we now -- it's the first time since back in 2009, we feel good about that. But organic growth is something we're always going to drive and focus on. And then again on the Hewitt front, again, we're kind of flat in organic across the 2. As we think about the second half for Aon Hewitt, on the consulting side, we were plus 4% in the first quarter, flat in the second quarter, kind of 2% year-to-date. Our expectations are we're probably about that for the second half on the consulting side and a little better on the Outsourcing side. So we feel confident about growing organically for 2011, which is a step. But if there's one area that we really want continue to drive forward on, it really is going to be on the gross side. Everything else is exactly on track with what we'd hoped to do.
Operator: And next question, Dan Farrell, Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Could you give us a little more color on the Consulting Services organic growth? And just -- it seems a little weaker then I might have thought. Maybe you're bumping up against some tougher comparisons in the investment side or the compensation side. And then also just longer-term view of what -- where you see that going and how you see healthcare legislation having a long-term impact there.
Greg Case: Yes. As I said before, literally, from a consulting standpoint, we really say, if you look at the first 6 months, we are plus 4% in the first quarter, 0 in the second quarter on the Consulting Services side. And what you really saw there, by the way, was exceptional growth on the global compensation business and on the investment consulting business, and it was offset by a decline and some pressure really across the U.S. on both the retirement side and the U.S. health and benefit side. From our standpoint, you asked us to think about the year. First half, first 6 months was about 2%. We kind of think the second half is going to be roughly in the same place. We're going to keep pushing and driving towards that. We have the strongest, we believe, an exceptionally strong platform in the context of what's going on on the Consulting Services side. And when you put in context with Health Care Reform and all the other things that are out there, we believe when clients think about their issues day-to-day on pensions, retirement, health and benefits, talent, those needs are going to go up, not down. And we've got the strongest platform in the world to serve those needs. So we feel very, very good about how we're positioned in the healthcare front, on the consulting front, both Brokerage and in admin and then on the Outsourcing side. So from our standpoint, the story here is not different than it is in risk. We feel like the issues today are more significant for our clients than before, and we feel like we've got exceptionally strong platforms to address those issues.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay. And just one other thing. On the reinsurance Brokerage segment, how much of a margin differential is there on the capital markets and facultative business versus the treaty business?
Christa Davies: Look, we really think about that business as a Risk Solutions business, Aon Benfield plus ARS combined, and that's certainly the way we report it. And as Greg said, you can see margin year-over-year continues to expand and we do not break those businesses apart.
Greg Case: And even in the context of Aon Benfield, when we think what we do for clients, it really is about capital solutions. So whether it's treaty, facultative solutions or capital market solutions, we're really bringing to them an integrated view around how to improve their return on invested capital. That's actually served us exceptionally well. That's why the win rates are, as I described before, are improving and we expect will continue to do so. And so we really think about it in a much more integrated way, as Christa described.
Operator: And next, Meyer Shields, Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The FX hit apparently came in the HR Solutions segment, and I was hoping you could explain the mechanics of that.
Christa Davies: Sorry, the FX hit in the HR Solutions segment?
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. In other words, you recorded $0.03 of favorable FX, I shouldn't say hit, I should say bump. Overall FX looks like it had a negative impact on the margin on the insurance side. So when we do the math on the consulting side, I'm just trying to figure out how various FX changes impact the margin in HR Solutions.
Christa Davies: Got it. There was no FX impact on margin in the HR Solutions segment. The impact on EPS you saw, as I mentioned, was primarily the $0.03 impact for the adjustment results was primarily due to the euro and Australian dollar. The impact on the Risk Solutions margin was really primarily due to the pound, U.S. dollar, and there's no impact to the HR Solutions margin.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, so where in the income statement would that $0.03 be located?
Christa Davies: I'm sorry?
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'm just looking through the income statement. I'm to see where -- which line item I guess or combination of line items produce -- reflect that $0.03?
Christa Davies: Well, it's really going to flow through in both revenue and expense in both -- really, in the Risk Solutions segment is the main area it's going to flow through, Meyer. So basically, as you bring back -- I mean the impact on the Risk Solutions margin is primarily due to the phenomenon of in the U.K. we have about $400 million to $450 million of U.S.-denominated revenue in both our ARS and Aon Benfield businesses on a yearly basis. And therefore, you have U.S.-denominated revenue and pound-denominated expenses. And as the pound changes, that reduces a negative impact on margin for the quarter. So it's really going to flow through on the revenue and expense lines, and nearly all expense lines, in that Risk Solutions segment. Does that help?
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: It does, but I have to take it offline because I'm still a little bit lost. Greg, can I switch gears quickly and just talk -- we had a couple of I guess relatively high-profile departures with Andrew Appel and Elliot Richardson. And I'm wondering if you could talk to whether there's anything that we should read into that?
Greg Case: Yes, I would say there really isn't when you think about sort of what we're trying to do overall with the overall business. And these are very separate cases and separate situations. In the case of Andrew, he's done great contributions at our firm, a lot of great things, and he's decided to move on to do something different. Mutual discussion and it has gone very, very well and excited for Andrew and his new role and what he's trying to do. I'm very supportive. In the case of Elliott and even on the at construction side, we've made some calls to grow our business and build our business long term. And as you think about sort of what we're trying to do to unite our global firm and deliver great value to our clients in a very local way, we've got to have our colleagues around the table doing that effectively, and we made some calls. We made some very specific calls around the folks who can help us do that. And to the extent people couldn't, then we made some specific calls around, it was time for them to do something different. We wish him well, but not part of global Aon. And beauty of it is we're quite confident in the teams we've got. We're very excited about how they've come on board and what they're doing to build our business. These are colleagues who have been with us for a long time with a great bench. And you didn't mention the construction side, but that's equally high-profile. Kevin White and team there are just doing an exceptional job of building that business. We're very excited about what's going on in the construction front and continue to make substantial in essence [ph] in the context of that. And we've also, on the facultative side, done exactly the same thing. We're just exceptionally excited about that. And then on the consulting side, I would say Kristi Savacool and Bal Dail have just -- are doing an exceptional job as we build that business and drive it forward. And really the punchline is we're blessed with a great bench. We're also focused on a mission to build our firm going forward and we're going to have the people around the table who can help us do that and only those folks.
Operator: Next we have Brian Meredith, UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: A couple of questions for you all here. The first one, I'm wondering if, Christi, you can comment on what the impact of some of the recent acquisitions may have had on margins in the Risk Solutions area? Would that pressure margins at all?
Christa Davies: It had a minor impact on margins but not a material impact, Brian. I mean, obviously as we're bringing Glenrand in it, it's significant acquisitions. As Greg said, it really does position us as the number one broker across the continent of Africa, one of the key areas sort of growing in the global economy and very, very important for our clients.
Greg Case: It's another example of, Brian, around we do a number of things like that, particularly that, investments in the Risk Insight Platform, a few other places that we don't breakout and will, from quarter-to-quarter, have significant impact. We'll absorb that and move forward as we build margins over the course of each year.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Great. And then secondly with respect to the Hewitt expense saves going forward, I'm wondering, are you still on track to deliver the $229 million to $242 million that you laid out for 2011 originally?
Christa Davies: Yes, we absolutely are. So if you saw in the quarter, we believe we're 100% on track to achieve the $242 million for 2011 and the $355 million for 2013. And you saw $43 million of restructuring, plus other synergy and operational improvements come through in Q1 and you saw that number grow to $59 million in Q2. So if you add those 2 numbers together, you can see that we're well on track to achieve $242 million.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Great. And then the last one, Greg, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what kind of the competition out there right now for talent in the insurance brokerage area? I mean we do see a lot of teams exchanging hands, I'm hearing, in the marketplace that the various firms kind of paying up for people. What does it look like out there right now? And will that cause any kind of pressure on margins here going forward, particularly if we see some rate improvement and maybe offset some of that?
Greg Case: Yes. You know Brian, I think from a talent standpoint, this is something we live everyday. And in fact as we reflect on it, it's something that I think it's going to become even more and more prevalent as you think about Aon. We have worked hard to try to build our capability globally. And in doing so, have worked really hard to create great opportunities for our individual practitioners, our leaders. We really want to be the place that if you want to be a practitioner in either risk or people, you come to Aon, and whether Aon Risk Solutions, Aon Benfield or Aon Hewitt. And we want to keep pushing on that mission. We want to work to improve our capability here. We think we've done that. We know we've got a long way to go. We're going to keep on investing in it. It also means we're going to be an absolute target for talent around the world. We know that, which is why we've got to keep the bar high. But it's -- one of the things that's remarkable about the firm is as we bring people in, it builds the talent pool, but we've got incredible capability around the firm with a very, very deep bench. and we're quite excited about where we are right now from a talent standpoint. And we believe that's going to serve us quite well as we continue to grow the business. Is the competition higher or lower? I don't now. It's always going to be out there. It's as if when people talk about, what's the competition on the client side? It's always high. That's the world we live in, and we're excited to be part of it.
Operator: Next, Adam Klauber from William Blair.
Adam Klauber: What's the pipeline on the Outsource business? And when can we get better visibility on wins, loses of the combined company?
Christa Davies: So one of the great things about our Outsource business with 5- to 7-year average contract length in the BPO space and 3- to 4-year in the benefits administration space is we have a terrific view of the pipeline over the next several years. And we feel very good about the trajectory, not just in terms of revenue growth long term, but in terms of win rates. And across our Outsourcing business, our win rates are very high, and it frankly improved substantially from 2010 to 2011, a great tribute to the amazing leadership and depths of talent in that Outsourcing business. So we feel very good about the trajectory both in terms of revenue growth and margin expansion in our Outsourcing business.
Adam Klauber: Okay. And then on the Brokerage business, I'm sure you saw the CIB just came out and said, the rates have moved. Rates have moved pretty much flat. Number one, is that helping the U.S. business right now? And do you think it will have a bigger impact in the second half on organic growth?
Greg Case: Yes, I would say just taking a step back, Adam, as we think about sort of growth for the second half, we think it will be marginally better than the first half overall. Obviously reflects across our book both on the Risk Solutions side and Aon Benfield side. And so that's how we see the second half of the year playing out. I wouldn't reflect back on rates though. As we think about it, we took a pretty analytic view of this. We think, literally, this is what happened in the first half. It's still soft pricing globally. Globally, exposure's are stabilizing a little bit. It's still down, but not as much as it was before. So maybe you call that improvement, I guess, in the context of overall rates. But if you just think about what we reflected in the Risk Insight Platform, the Global Risk Insight Platform, literally, and that's what we use as a measure rate. Is not conjecture. It's the largest repository of insurance information exists on the planet today. And in Q2, they were down 2.5% across our system. Just to put in perspective, in Q1, they were down 3.5%, in Q4 last year, they were down 4.4%. So we've gone from negative 4.4% to negative 3.5% to negative 2.5%, and we feel like that's a pretty precise assessment of exactly what's going on across our book. And you might suggest that our book might represent a reflection of the overall insurance marketplace given the spread of business we got on the retail side. And then on the reinsurance side, we've stated -- we're basically at stable to down 5%, which is exactly where we came out on the sort of the June, July time frame on the reinsurance side. And again, this represents 41 specific programs we put in place in June and July. I would suggest this is probably the broadest market view that's out there. No one else is close in terms of sort of what happened in that time frame. That flat to down 5% was better than January, by the way. It was more stark or down more in January. But from our standpoint, we think it represents, frankly, a reflection of what we've been able to accomplish on behalf of clients. I mean, the market strength we've got combined with exceptional analytics produce what is really great, great results for clients. And if you compare it to sort of what's been published by other folks out there, if, in fact, that's a big achievement for their clients, we're talking about literally a relative hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of savings for our clients in the context of what we achieved against these 41 programs. So from our standpoint, rates are still down, but not as down as they were. And again, as I said before, from an organic standpoint, we see some positive trends for us in the second half. Does that give you enough background?
Operator: Next question, Matt Heimermann, JPMorgan.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just a more high level. I mean, I guess you guys are looking into rolling out a direct-to-buyer or kind of SME aggregator in other parts of the world. And, I guess, can you give us a sense of maybe where you are in that process and potentially what timing might be if you're considering bringing that to the states?
Greg Case: Yes, this is really more, Matt, about, as we described before, on the overall Aon Broking front and what we're trying to accomplish in the context of sort of how we serve our clients and looking for ways to aggregate risk, bring things together and really put together a better and better world-class programs in the context of how we serve clients. And this is just, again, back to kind of the investments we're making in the business that do impact quarter-to-quarter margin as we talked about before, but we believe actually reinforce our capability to deliver substantial growth and margin improvement for the long term. This is just one of those examples. That's in development. And, again, as we said before, on a lot of the Aon brokering initiatives we see real impact in more 2012, 2013, but we believe we've got an incredible opportunity here. When you think about our position, the middle market and small commercial, it is literally the biggest in the world today. Our Affinity business is a $600 million-plus business, so incredibly strong business. We have a proven model that we know works as we aggregate risk and actually pull together a package of opportunities we can deliver back to clients. And so we see absolutely substantial opportunity to do this across our global book. And we've really never pursued this in a way we talked about before, nor could we have until we brought online all the things we're doing around Aon Broking. So it really is just an evolution of what's happened out of GRIP, and what's happened as we think about ways to serve clients. And it's going to be '12 and '13, but I'm glad you raised it because we believe it's a -- we believe this is going to be a substantial step forward in the context of Aon Broking to the betterment of our clients and to the betterment of our shareholders.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: That's helpful. Should we think about this as you reshaping how the business is transacted and therefore it goes more to expense efficiency than it does -- I suspect there's probably a bit of both in the strategy, but can you help us put into context how you think about it? I guess I'm thinking maybe efficiency versus just what you think it means for market share, things like that?
Greg Case: Yes, I think there will be definitely both sides. This, for us, though, as much as anything, Matt, it's about really how we grow the business and build the business, because we're going to -- we will in fact be generating more attractive opportunities for clients. And in addition to that, so literally, that's the gross of the equation, in addition to that, we're going to be generating greater yields. So if you think about the things we do to grow our business, we get more clients, we do more stuff with the existing clients, and we increase yield per dollar of premium placed. And this really is going to help us, we believe, get more clients and, we believe, increase yield per dollar of premium placed. Those 2 things we think, from the combination, will have very positive implications on the growth structure of the firm and on the margin of the firm, both.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay. And then when you said just on the timing question with the U.S. when you say 2012, 2013 in terms of starting to see more material contribution or starting to see this getting out of the investment phase, maybe to the more operational phase, is that kind of the timing we'd expect to see it maybe permeate other geographies outside of where you're testing it now?
Greg Case: It's exactly right. And in fact, as we described before, we've gone through a progression. First, we realized if we capture the data and the understanding, even though it was an incredibly substantial investment to do that, again, think about it, we really are asking our broker colleagues to enter data around the world, so they'd give us the basis of GRIP, and then investing literally in -- in Ireland, 100-plus colleagues actually scrubbed the data to make sure it's absolutely pristine, so we can actually use it to serve clients. Then you -- that's got to get us into 2011. We're really starting to see some benefit there. And beyond that, you add these programs on top of that, which is the next natural evolution. That will increase yield. And again, just for reference, if you're talking about $40 billion to $50 billion of flow, 10 basis points of yield, 50 basis points of yield matters a lot in the context of being able to actually to drive that. And we're going to start to see that in 2012, 2013 as we continue to evolve this whole idea of Aon Broking and serving clients in the context of that.  So we see it meaningfully impacting in 2012, 2013. And again, I'm glad you raised it. It's another example as to why as we watch this evolve, we have basically, what we would call, proved the concept. We know it works. We've done it in different places. We proved it. And now, literally, it's about scaling the concept, taking that proven concept and driving it around the world. And that's really what 2012, 2013 is about. And that's why we're pretty excited about this.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And then just one on the HR Solutions business. I mean I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about project revenues. The macro commentary you give isn't exactly constructive for project revenues coming back. So when you're talking about improving growth rates, I'm assuming that's without project revenue, but I'd just be curious how significant you think the project revenue side can be to organic growth and maybe looking out 12 to 24 months from now?
Christa Davies: Right. So as we think about the impact of the economy and sort of a fragile economy on the Outsourcing business, project revenues is one of the big impacts in calendar year 2011 and it was in calendar year 2010. I would note that we have largely sort of lapped the big sort of year-over-year impact of that now in Q2. And so while there's kind of minimal impact to the second half of the year, it really is much, much more than what we've seen in the first half of the year. As we think about, sort of, project revenue, it's really related often to M&A activity, changes in benefits plans as a result of U.S. Health Care Reform. So you can see some real opportunities as you look out, sort of, 12, 24 to 36 months, that to grow over time.
Operator: Next question is Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: Sorry to beat on a dead horse here, but if we look the -- at your target of executing year-over-year margin expansion in the broking business in regards to economic trends, even if I look at it on a year-to-year basis not quarter-to-quarter, it still seems like margins are slightly down on a trailing 12-month basis. So am I looking at it incorrectly or you looking already at 2012 when you're talking about executing this year-over-year strategy? What am I missing here?
Christa Davies: So first of all, you're absolutely looking at it correctly. So year-to-date, margins are down, there's no doubt that. We think about it as a full calendar year, sort of, view of the world. And as we look out, we feel confident that we're on track. And so we just don't think about any quarter-to-quarter sort of impacts because there are a lot of things in our business that are lumpy. And as Greg described, we are making investments in our business that are going to generate long-term returns. And we're very confident that we're on track to 25%.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And could we also talk a little bit about maybe the potential for a downgrade in the U.S. that -- of 1 notch or 2 notches? What impact does that have on your business?
Christa Davies: Yes. So the first thing I'd say is obviously there's a lot of implications potentially to the economy of that, which are very difficult to speculate upon. So if I leave that aside, then I think there are 2 potential impacts of a U.S., sort of, debt situation. One is FX. And obviously, if the U.S. dollar were to sort of decline in value relative to the euro, Aussie and New Zealand and Canadian dollars then that is a positive impact in our business as we bring back revenue and expenses from those countries. And then -- so that's the FX impact. And the second one is interest rates. If interest rates were to rise, then it has 2 positive impacts on our business. The first one is on fiduciary funds. And each 100-basis point rise in interest rate is about $35 million to $40 million straight to the top line and bottom line. And the second impact on our business is unfunded pension liability. Obviously, an increase in interest rates would decrease our unfunded pension liability, which is again, good for us. The last thing I would say is we are in a very strong position in terms of balance sheet and financial flexibility. And so there are absolutely no issues in terms of liquidity.
Greg Case: And just generally, overall though, if you think about sort of the specifics, obviously we, like everyone, want this to get resolved in a reasonable way for our clients because, while Christa's highlighted it very, very well, I think specifically what the macro impacts are, things that impact our clients impact us ultimately. So it's obviously we want to get this resolved.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: Right. Can I sneak in one more question about your recent decision to slash the U.S. wholesale panel to basically 2? A, how do you address clients' concerns about ability to add value with only 2 panelists? And two, there seems to have been some talk about potential conflicts of interest there. How do you square those?
Greg Case: Well, first and foremost, as we think about sort of how we compete in the marketplace and what we're trying to do, everything we sort of step back and do is really around driving value for our clients, period. And as we think about approaching the market, that literally is all the investments we're making. If you think about the formidable investments we've made. It really is around driving greater value for clients. And that's something clients improve operating performance, strengthen balance, reduce volatility. Nothing actually stands in the way of how Aon is maniacally focused on doing that. And we're going to continue to do that. So that drives everything we do. In the context of that, the decision really was around how we can actually help clients and really make sure that their business is actually handled in a way that's consistent. And the difficulty as you are handing off to multiple wholesalers, there's often variability in actually how that happens over time. It's variability in the context of how you think about it inside the U.S., it's variability when you think about it when you actually transferred over to the U.K. So for us, as we reflected on how to do that and we talked to clients, we want to be extremely consistent in how we actually handle that.  By the way, that includes building the capability in-house, so we're actually not handing it off to a third party who then handles our clients. That actually concerns us a great deal, and that's why we made the initial decision to actually reduce the panel and focus it much more on how we serve clients effectively. Then I would say in terms of the overall process, this is a process that really has been handled incredibly pristinely. We handled it much like we do any major decision that affects our clients or it affects our shareholders, a completely independent process. It's very objective, specific set of criteria. In fact probably even more so, overdid the process. It took us 6 months to make the overall decision. We are confident we made a decision that we think will help our clients long term. And it's selection of going from really was down -- 9 down to 2 to serve our clients effectively, and in the end, feel very, very good about the overall process and how it's been implemented so far.
Operator: Our last question comes from Jay Cohen, Bank of America.
Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to clarify one thing, and that was the tax rate. I guess by saying that the annual tax rate would be about 29%, are we talking for the second half of the year a tax rate closer to 30 or slightly above?
Christa Davies: So I'm talking about the underlying effective tax rate on operations. What we reported in Q2 is essentially after specific adjustments, Jay. So as you think about your model, it's really the tax rate for the full year on an underlying basis for 2011 and going forward.
Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: So just to clarify, so second half of the year, you're saying, should be about 29%?
Christa Davies: Yes, on an underlying or sort of effective rate going forward, yes.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: No closing remarks, just thanks, everybody, for taking part in the call today. We appreciate it, and we appreciate your interest. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded, and that it's important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Corporation.
Greg Case: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. To begin, our first quarter results reflect continued momentum and progress as we execute on our strategy to distinctly strengthen and unite Aon around the globe, irrespective of the stock market, economic conditions or other challenges outside our control. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review: First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is continued areas of investment across Aon; and third is overall organic growth performance.  On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share. In the first quarter, organic revenue was plus 2%, highlighted by solid growth in both our Retail Brokerage and Consulting Services businesses, placing us firmly on track for growth in 2011.  Adjusted operating margin decreased 230 basis points and EPS was $0.80 as the inclusion of Hewitt results, including a significant increase in intangible amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate, offset strong underlying performance and effective capital management. Overall, our team views the underlying first quarter results as a solid quarter of continued progress, as we strengthen the firm for long-term growth and value creation. On the second topic, further areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid operating performance combined with expense discipline and strong cash flow continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities. As we have significant opportunity remaining to deliver further margin expansion, we will continue to build on our leadership position and industry-leading capabilities to capture growth opportunities we see across our markets, specifically focused on the 2 most dynamic sectors of the global economy, risk and people.  A few examples include, in Risk Solutions, we're investing in innovative technology, such as our Global Risk Insight Platform and Impact On Demand to ensure that clients have full access to the best of global Aon in every region around the globe. In fact, highlighting the unique value of GRIP, we've now completed over 1 million trades, capturing more than $50 billion of premium and continue to expand its addressable market opportunity. We're also investing additional capability in talent, as well as strengthening our international footprint through recent and continued acquisitions such as Glenrand in South Africa, which solidifies our position as the largest broker on the continent of Africa. We're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the revenue engine in EMEA and Asia Pacific; the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention rates and ensuring clients understand our value proposition; and the rollout of our Aon Broking platform, to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk in any geography around the globe.  In HR Solutions, we continue to strengthen our industry-leading position in both public and corporate healthcare exchanges, enabling clients to prepare for ultimate changes in healthcare legislation with design, purchasing, administrative capability. We're expanding our capability in investment management consulting as highlighted by the acquisition of EnnisKnupp. This complements our incredibly strong U.K. business, creating an industry leader with over $4.3 trillion in assets under advisement. We're expanding our international footprint as the workforce is increasingly becoming more global with investments in key talent and capabilities across Asia. And finally, we're continuing to invest in expanding our core HR BPO offering and platforms, including the use of new social media channels. In addition to our focus on our core BPO business, we're also continuing to expand add-on benefits in HR Solutions that have shown significant growth in the last 2 years. In summary, across Risk Solutions and HR Solutions, our fundamental client-serving capability continues to substantially strengthen around the globe. These investments, fully funded in the context of long-term margin improvement, position Aon very well to take advantage of an improving global economy and a long-term growth opportunity we see across our markets. Finally, on the third topic of growth. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue was plus 2%, a continuation of the positives trend we saw in the prior quarter and a solid start to the year, despite soft pricing, excess capital and fragile economic conditions globally.  Against these headwinds, which were primarily market-related, we're driving a set of initiatives that continue to strengthen our underlying performance and give us confidence that our Risk Solutions business is firmly positioned for long-term growth and leveraged in an improving economy. We have strong management of our renewable book portfolios with Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction.  Strong new business generation of more than $200 million across our Retail business with double-digit new business growth across many markets including France, Italy, Asia, Africa, New Zealand and Canada, just to name a few, highlighting the strength of our global client-serving capability. Investments in new product and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP, Client Promise and Impact on Demand. Turning to the individual businesses. In the Americas, organic growth was plus 4%. We saw a strong growth in Latin America and in our Affinity products, modest growth in U.S. Retail despite continued pressure from pricing which is down low single-digits on average and a weakness in major sectors such as construction.  On the international front, organic revenue growth was plus 3%. We saw a strong growth across Asia and New Zealand, driven by a solid client retention and new business activity. We have modest growth in the U.K. Retail side and EMEA as exposures are generally stable. We're recognizing the economic conditions remain fragile across the region. In Reinsurance, organic revenue was flat. Results reflect a modest improvement from a minus 1% in the prior quarter. Growth in facultative placements were offset primarily by higher CD retentions, continued soft pricing in the U.S. for treaty placements. And despite significant industry losses in international in the first quarter, we believe excess capacity globally will continue to drive soft pricing globally, albeit, at a moderately lesser rate of decline. Given these industry conditions for Treaty business and the transactional orientation nature of the facultative placements and capital advisory, we'd expect the trends on our Reinsurance business to be fairly similar for the foreseeable future. Turning to HR Solutions. Overall, organic revenue was flat, similar to the prior quarter as price compression in Benefits Admin continued and fragile economic conditions placed pressure on corporate discretionary spend and global unemployment trends.  Against these headwinds, which are primarily market-related, we're driving a set of initiatives that continues to strengthen our underlying performance and gives us confidence that our HR Solutions business is firmly positioned for long-term growth and leverage in an improving economy, with a high degree of recurring revenue across HR Solutions, with strong renewal rates highlighting strong client satisfaction. Solid business generation of over 100 new client wins including more than 10 new large and mid-market Benefits Admin wins and a very significant win with a large leading financial institution in HR BPO. And continued investments in new product and service capabilities in emerging markets such as investment management consulting, healthcare exchanges and international markets. Turning to the individual businesses on the HR Solutions side. In Consulting Services, organic revenue increased 4%. The results reflect the modest improvements in the prior quarter. Solid growth in international health and benefits and human capital consulting was partially offset by the impact of weaker economic conditions in the U.S. retirement consulting. In Outsourcing, organic revenue decreased 3%. Anticipated price depression and a modest decline in project-related revenue in Benefits Administration was partially offset by new client wins and growth in point solutions revenue and the HR Business Process Outsourcing business. Excluding the $14 million favorable impact relating to deferred revenue by Hewitt in the prior quarter, organic revenue Outsourcing would have been flat compared to the prior year quarter. Most important, I wanted to provide a brief update on the progress of Aon Hewitt. First, our teams are working exceptionally well together to support clients and client disruption has been basically nonexistent. As an example, 8 new Benefits Administration clients went live on January 1, and 2 large HR BPO clients are ramping up with all systems go, and implementation proceeding exceptionally well. The leadership team is being particularly sensitive to all the normal issues that arise out there and they're listening very carefully and working hard to respond to feedback from our colleagues around the world. And we're deeply engaged with key talent across the businesses to ensure we're building a solid foundation for long-term growth. Second, new business wins across Aon Hewitt continue to be exceptional across middle market, large corporate and Fortune 100 clients, with Aon Hewitt having already secured a number of new business wins across multiple product lines, as clients fully recognize the breadth and depth of Aon Hewitt's products and services capability. Lastly, the integration activities are largely complete. We are fully on track to deliver the $355 million of synergy savings in 2013, as well as our committed savings in 2011. And Christa will provide an update on this shortly. With the integration work set, we're focused on growing and building Aon Hewitt for the future. It's a very exciting time for all of our team.  In summary of our first quarter results, we're delivering solid underlying progress against the key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Events occurring in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, our pending healthcare reform in the U.S, just to name a few, only reinforce the needs of our clients and the significant long-term growth opportunities for Aon as the industry leader in both Risk and HR Solutions.  I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review.
Christa Davies: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect continued progress to strengthen our industry-leading position and client-serving capabilities across risk and people. We are firmly on track for growth in 2011. Against that, we're managing expenses, delivering savings from our restructuring program and effectively allocating capital as highlighted by the repurchase of $350 million in common stock in the quarter. Now let me turn to the results for the first quarter. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, is $0.80 per share for the first quarter, compared to $0.83 in the prior-year quarter, as the inclusion of Hewitt results, including a $61 million increase in intangible amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate offset strong underlying performance and effective capital management. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 include: $30 million of restructuring charges primarily related to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program and $15 million of transaction-related Hewitt costs. Lastly, there were 2 items not adjusted for in the core results, including $19 million or $0.04 of lease termination costs and facility exits in France and an unfavorable impact of $0.02 related to foreign currency translation. Now let me talk about each of the segments. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 2% and we've delivered an operating margin of 19% on an adjusted basis, down 150 basis points from the prior-year quarter. Our operating performance for the quarter was primarily impacted by 3 items: First, as noted above, we incurred $19 million of lease termination costs or 110 basis point impact for facility exits in France that were not part of the formal restructuring program; second, foreign currency translation, primarily resulting from a weaker euro versus the U.S. dollar, unfavorably impacted margin by approximately 60 basis points; lastly, lower investment income impacted margin by 10 basis points. These 3 items, largely nonrecurring or macro-related, unfavorably impacted margin by 180 basis points in the quarter.  Excluding these items, our underlying performance for the quarter continues to demonstrate strong operational discipline and underlying structural margin improvement, positioning the segment for greater operating leverage long term, as growth and economic conditions continue to improve around the globe. Let me spend a moment on each of the restructuring programs, key initiatives that are enabling concurrent funding of investments and delivering long-term structural margin expansion. With respect to the 2007 restructuring program, we have incurred 100% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings. Restructuring savings in the first quarter are estimated at $134 million compared to $110 million in the prior-year quarter. Approximately $113 million of savings were related to Risk Solutions segment, primarily for workforce reduction. With respect to the Aon Benfield restructuring program, we incurred $7 million of charges in the quarter and have now incurred 92% of the $155 million of total costs necessary to deliver the remaining savings. Restructuring savings in the first quarter are estimated at $29 million compared to $22 million in the prior year quarter. Overall, we are ahead of schedule on our 2007 and Aon Benfield restructuring program. We have completed nearly 100% of the charges as of the end of the first quarter, yet we still have approximately $48 million of incremental Risk Solutions savings still to achieve under these 2 programs between now and the end of 2011. The following 3 areas of margin opportunity are within our control and continue to cross firmly on track towards delivering our long-term margin target of 25% in Risk Solutions: number one, operational efficiency and the remaining restructuring savings; number two, the continued rollout of the revenue engine; and number three, Aon Broking and GRIP-related initiatives.  In addition, there are 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant operating leverage based on improvements in the external market. An improving global economy in areas such as employment levels, asset values and corporate revenues will drive leverage through exposure growth, along with every 100 basis point rise in short-term interest rates delivers roughly $35 million to $40 million to the bottom line. And lastly, improvements in insurance pricing. We are on track for delivering our long-term margin target of 25% for Risk Solutions. Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue was flat, and we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 14.4% as the results reflect the merger with Hewitt, including a $61 million increase in intangible asset amortization expense. To further assess the underlying performance of operating income and margin in the segment, we believe it's useful to add together results for both Aon Consulting and Hewitt in the prior-year quarter to form your starting point of analysis. For example, if we take Hewitt's adjusted operating income of $123 million plus $56 million for Aon Consulting, your combined total is $179 million of operating income as reported for the prior year quarter. If we subtract additional intangible amortization expense of $61 million, this leaves an underlying $118 million of operating income. Compared to the $161 million we reported in the first quarter, the increase in operating income reflects savings related to the restructuring program, additional synergy savings and other operational improvements. Essentially, we believe that strong operating income growth on flat organic revenue implies solid operating margin expansion in the HR Solutions segment. Lastly, for the HR Solutions segment, I wanted to briefly comment on the Aon Hewitt restructuring program. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $23 million of charges in the quarter, primarily for workforce reduction. The Aon Hewitt restructuring plan is expected to result in cumulative cost of $325 million through the end of the plan, primarily encompassing $180 million in workforce reduction and $145 million in real estate rationalization costs. Cash costs are expected to be approximately $275 million. Savings related to the restructuring program in the first quarter are estimated at $24 million with additional synergy savings achieved outside of the formal restructuring program. We expect to deliver total annual savings of $355 million in 2013, including approximately $280 million of annual savings related to restructuring programs and additional savings in areas such as information technology, procurement and public company costs. We are on track to deliver $243 million of annual savings in 2011. These savings are the first of 3 key drivers for delivering our long-term operating margin target of 20% in HR Solutions. The other 2 key drivers are growth in the core business, including HR BPO improvement, and declining intangible amortization expense beginning in 2013. Now let me discuss certain line items outside of the operating segment. Interest expense increased $29 million due to an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding following the merger with Hewitt. Other income in the quarter was $17 million including a $9 million gain related to sale of certain investments and $7 million related to distributions from certain private equity securities. Going forward, for these items, we would expect a run rate of approximately $5 million per quarter of interest income, $35 million of unallocated expense and $65 million of interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased to 29% compared to 24.9% in the prior-year quarter, due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of income following the merger with Hewitt. The prior-year quarter was favorably impacted by certain deferred tax adjustments. Going forward, we will continue to anticipate an underlying tax credit on continuing operations of 30% for 2011. Turning to shares. Average diluted shares outstanding increased to 345.4 million in the first quarter compared to 283.4 million in the prior-year quarter due primarily to the issuance of 61 million shares of common stock related to the merger with Hewitt, partially offset by the company's share repurchase program. Actual common shares outstanding on March 31 were 330.5 million compared to 332.3 million at December 31. There are approximately 14 million diluted profit equivalents. The company has approximately $1.7 billion remaining under the share repurchase program previously authorized in 2010. Now let me turn to the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $1.3 billion and total debt outstanding increased to $4.9 billion. Included in these figures is approximately $377 million of cash that was used to fully repay $375 million of Canadian debt due April 2011. Post this transaction, we had roughly $900 million of cash and short-term investments, and $4.5 billion of total debt, similar to December 31. Per requirements of our outstanding $1 billion term loan, we expect to pay down $100 million of the term loan debt in 2011. In summary, we delivered 2% organic revenue, placing us firmly on track for growth in 2011 despite fragile economic conditions and a continued soft market. We continue to strategically invest in long-term growth opportunities and are well underway with the integration of Hewitt. We are managing expenses, driving operational initiatives across both segments and fully on track to achieve our long-term operating margin targets. We have significant leverage to an improving global economy. Our balance sheet and strong cash flow continue to provide significant financial flexibility to deliver increased shareholder value as highlighted by the repurchase of $350 million of common stock in the quarter. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Yaron Kinar, Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: My first question and I have a follow-up after that. My first question relates to the Risk Solutions segment and the expenses there. So even when I adjust for the FX and the lease termination and despite the 3% improvement in the comp and benefit expenses, the adjusted operating income was still flat year-over-year. So I was hoping to get a little more color on what, I guess, is organic revenue growth related expenses? And maybe how we should think about it going forward?
Christa Davies: Yes. So I think as we look at our Risk Solutions margin, we believe that we have underlying Risk Solutions margin expansion in the quarter after we adjust for the onetime lease termination payment in France, that's 110 basis points and the FX and investment income impact of 70 basis points, that's 180 basis points which if you then adjust for that, it's 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. We do believe that we continue to sort of drive a structural operational improvement in our business which is leading to long-term margin expansion both over the course of the year and towards our long-term 25% margin target.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: But wasn't that improvement that you were just talking about, it all came from the compensation expense side and it's pretty much offset by the other expenses in a scalable business, or what I thought was a scalable business.
Christa Davies: Yes, so I mean, I think there are a couple of onetime items in the quarter which are really sort of meaning that we're not getting quite the level of margin expansion we would excluding those onetime items.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And then on the HR Solutions side, could you maybe talk a little bit about the pension business? Do you see it coming back at some point, maybe to the point where it starts getting like 2%, 4%, 5% organic growth again for a longer period? And do you think that's possible without a regulatory change?
Greg Case: We see a tremendous opportunity across the HR Solutions business from a growth standpoint. And in fact, if you just reflect on sort of the last few years in which what's happened in the U.S. economy and the global economy on that front, the business has actually helped serve quite well. And during that time, we made substantial investments to sort of build for the future long-term growth and we see a number of those items actually coming to pass now as we think about what's going on. When you just think about what's going on in the overall retirement market right now, and what's needed to think about pensions and retirement across an employee base, that demand is going up, not down and we're incredibly well-positioned for that. The same on the healthcare side, when you think about what's happening in the healthcare in the U.S. right now, just as one example, but you can actually talk about it around the world and the demand for advice in the context of reducing healthcare costs is actually going up. So we actually see lots of opportunity for growth across the HR Solutions business, whether it's on the retirement side, the investment advice side, the admin side. So we're very optimistic about how we think that's going to evolve over the next couple of years.
Operator: Next, Brian Meredith, UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: A couple of questions here. Greg, first one, I was hoping you could chat a little bit more what's going on in the Outsourcing business. We've been hearing from some of the carriers that they're starting to see some exposure growth out of the comp business and I'm just curious why you're not seeing it translate into the Outsourcing business as well.
Christa Davies: Yes. So Brian, I think one of the things we're seeing in our sort of HR Solutions business in Outsourcing in particular is, they're very long-term contracts. And so we absolutely sort of expect long-term growth in that business and as we've said before, with 5 to 7 years sort of average contract length in the HR BPO business, we can see the next 4 years of revenue and EBITDA growth. And so absolutely, we see the structural, sort of forces you're describing. They just take time to flow through given the long-term sort of contract nature in that business.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: So changes in employment don't have an immediate impact?
Christa Davies: Changes in employment absolutely do. And we have huge potential upside from changes in employment and they do flow through and get trued up on a monthly basis.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. So we haven't seen that yet, I guess, is what's happening here?
Christa Davies: Absolutely.
Greg Case: So we expect that, Bryan, on the horizon. And again, that will come through faster than in the U.K. For example, on the risk side, you see rates come through, so that's a much more direct impact.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. And then, also just curious on cash flows in the quarter, I mean share buyback was greater than I was expecting. You had some cautionary remarks on cash flows in I think last quarter on kind of the timing. I'm curious why the level of share buyback was great but why was it bigger in this quarter? Should we expect a big slow down coming forward?
Christa Davies: Yes. So I think as we think about sort of share buyback going forward, I'd look at sort of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet which I would observe post the Canadian debt is down from $1.2 billion at year-end to $900 million x the Canadian debt. And so we have used up excess cash in the quarter. And I would say, going forward, as we think about share buyback, Q4 is more of sort of a good run rate to use than the Q1 number. Because really what we've done there is we've got some excess cash on the balance sheet as well as operating cash flow.
Greg Case: Overall, Bryan, look at our investments on the buyback side, as Christa has described before on the call, reflecting sort of our view on where we are and the opportunity on return on invested capital. And we're just very, very positive on our current position and the opportunity against it and that reflects our investment.
Operator: Next question, Meyer Shields, Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I just want to follow up on Yaron's question with regard to retirement. Did we see within the U.S., a general trend towards later retirement for whatever reason, skepticism on Social Security or whatever, would that have a negative impact on -- or does that conform with your expectations and what's the estimated long-term impact on insurance and healthcare?
Greg Case: No. In fact, again, back kind of fundamental principles of sort of what's going on across really the overall HR Solutions business in total, whether it's on the retirement or pension side or whether it's on the healthcare side, we actually see demand for advice in that business which is really what we do exceptionally well going up. And in fact, because the costs are going up, the demand for high-quality execution, which is also what we're capable of doing in the Outsourcing businesses, is actually going up. So we are very, very bullish on sort to the fundamental underpinnings of what drives our HR Solutions business, both on the advice side as well as on the execution side. I mean, as an example, I was with a client last week, just talking about their current situation, and look, they're essentially talking about how they can think about supporting their employees for overall retirement and actually delivering on a sort of promises that are helping their employees deliver on a set of commitments that they've really made over time. And our advice in the context of what's going on in the current marketplace is vital to them both in terms of how they actually execute it but also in terms of how they do it in a cost-effective way and that same argument holds true on the health and benefits side.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And a couple of quick modeling questions if I can. When would be the expected share issuance of compensation over the course of the year? And the second would be the ramp up of the $200 million or so in expected too of related savings sort of over the balance of that one.
Christa Davies: Right. So on the share issuance, share issuance in the form of stock compensation has been coming down over the last couple years. We would expect around 8 million shares over the course of 2011. Q1 is always the highest because that's when we issue shares related to our sort of major compensation program. And then your second question, the ramp-up of savings. So we have said that we are on track to deliver $243 million of total savings. That's comprised of restructuring savings plus other non-restructuring savings. You saw $24 million of restructuring savings plus other additional synergies in the quarter. As we complete projects the savings will ramp up during the course of the year to that $243 million total number.
Greg Case: But Meyer, we are fully on track, as Christa described, both in the overall game plan for 2011, as well as I described for the $355 million in 2013. Just the teams have just done a magnificent job coming together and really identifying the projects, getting those behind us and really focusing Aon Hewitt very much on future growth. But on the savings side have just done a terrific, terrific job.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No, I understand that and that's helpful. I'm just trying to sort of use the methodology you talked with summing Aon Hewitt's operating income, subtracting the increased amortization and then adding back the savings and then trying to get a handle on the seasonality of the...
Christa Davies: Would you like the -- so the baseline for the numbers in terms of how to think about the starting point and sort of seasonality of our business. So seasonality of our revenue overall, Q4 is our strongest revenue quarter, followed by Q1 and then Q2 and Q3 sort of on the revenue front. If you think about the starting point for the HR Solutions operating income for Q2, if you take the Aon Consulting operating income number of $47 million, you add in the Hewitt operating income number of $105 million from Q2 2010, that gets you to $152 million, Meyer. Then you get subtract the $61 million of amortization expense, that gets you to a $91 million operating income starting point for Q2. And you can do a similar math for Q3 2011, taking the numbers from Q3 2010, Aon Consulting $55 million, Hewitt $115 million, that gets you to $170 million, less the amortization expense of $61 million, gets you to $109 million starting point in operating income for Q3 2011.
Operator: Next question, Dan Farrell, Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: You guys, obviously, in the brokerage segment have taken out a lot of expenses over the last few years. And importantly, I think you've been very disciplined in putting some of the savings back into the business. I'm wondering, as those expense savings are ramping down, is there still a need to keep reinvesting? And I then also wonder if we're in an environment that's only modest organic growth, with the margin expansion that we think we might see be a little more muted because of ongoing stuff getting put back into the business.
Greg Case: Look, Dan, I'd take a step back, you're absolutely right. If you think about sort of what we've done over the last number of years, we've literally laid out a game plan and executed as cleanly as we could against our game plan which was to invest in our business, build for long-term organic growth and also do it in a way simultaneously that we build margin over time. And I will just reflect, as you think about your question and some previous questions around the margin front, you think about the track record over the course of the last 5 years. We've increased margin 530 basis points from 15% and change to 20% plus and we have a game plan in place to drive that to 25% as we said before. The 25% really is fundamentally driven by 5 specific areas where we believe there will be real improvement: The restructuring, and you're absolutely right, it's ramping down but there's still $48 million left in that. What we're doing with the revenue engine and how we think about bringing in new clients and increasing share with those clients. What we're doing with the Global Risk Insight Platform which is literally fundamentally helping us increase yield per dollar of premium placed. But obviously some of the things that are in less our control as Christa has described before on interest rates and the overall GDP situation. But we absolutely see that track that's driving the 25%. The first quarter has done nothing for us except underpin that we are on track to achieve that. And we've, by the way, done it in environments in which growth was flat or negative. Now that growth is picking up and we're confident we're seeing that, we are even more positive in terms of being able to both achieve organic growth and grow the margins to 25%. And many of the investments we've made over the course of the last few years are just beginning to really kick in and pay off as I described before, be it revenue engine efforts, GRIP or Client Promise, et cetera. So look, we feel very good about the progress and we're just going to keep marching forward against the game plan we set in place. And as I said, Q1 has done nothing but underscore that we are on track to do that, and whether it's on the risk side or the HR Solutions side.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Is there a level of organic that you think you need to achieve the 25%? And I realize there's other headwinds below interest rate environment and other things that could help as well over time, but is there a type of organic level in your mind that you think you have to sort of have on a run rate to get to that point?
Greg Case: There really isn't. Obviously, we're about growing our business and building our business over time. So we're absolutely focused on doing that. But we've reflected on these calls before, we absolutely don't need insurance pricing in the context of growing our business. And again, we've looked at over the last 5 years, we've been able to grow. Most of the years, we've certainly been able to improve margin and we've done that in an environment obviously that's got soft insurance pricing, a very negative economy, low interest rates, et cetera . And we absolutely have the game plan in place to continue to drive and do that. Obviously, growth and some of the external factors can really help accelerate that and can bring the 25% to us much more quickly. But irrespective of what happens on the items outside our control, we intend to get to a 25% margin.
Operator: Next question, Jay Gelb, Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: I wanted to touch base on the Reinsurance Brokerage business. You had a nice uptick in organic growth in the first quarter versus 4Q. And I'm trying to understand the implications of the impact on the massive Asia Pacific Reinsurance losses going forward, on what that means for Aon's organic revenue growth, as well as margins. And alongside of that, Aon recently put out a report talking about pretty dampened expectations for the U.S. midyear property Reinsurance renewals, so I was hoping you could expand a bit on that because the reinsurers are talking it up a bit more.
Greg Case: Yes, Jay, absolutely have to talk about it. Really 2 questions in the context of sort of what we're doing there. One as it relates to Aon Benfield and agree with you, our colleagues are doing a great job as we continue to build in that platform we believe is a very unique platform in the world today with Aon Benfield and our position on the treaty side, number one in the world, number one in facultative, number one in the capital markets world, et cetera. And a very strong platform and we're improving in that. I would say in the first quarter, factually, the market had a negative impact on us, it was negative 1% as you think about what we were able to deliver on flat organic growth, market impact was negative 1% and so overall, we haven't seen the impact that you've described. And as we go forward through the year, we expect it to be a lot of the same, obviously we're reacting to the trauma around world, and supporting our clients, but we see more of the same. In the context of your second quarter in the broader pricing environment, look, there's always going to be a lot of discussion. It's obviously an important topic for our clients, critical for our clients. We observe it on 2 sides; one is you think about Q1, literally what happened and then sort of think about what the go forward is going to look like. And we base our observations very much on a couple of things. One is the Aon Benfield team with those great analytics, really, we believe world-class analytics around this as well as what happens and the observations we take on the specific data out of GRIP, the Global Risk Insight Platform. And that’s now got 1 million trades on it, over $50 billion in premiums. So we literally look at that fact-based. And in the context of that, Jay, literally, rates were down 2% to 5% in the first quarter and that's just factually what they were. It impacted our Retail book negatively. It impacted our Reinsurance book as I described before. And on the go forward, what we've essentially said is assuming no new events, capital availability will remain at surplus levels, it just will, and as a result, it's going to continue to support a pretty competitive market. Obviously, we recognize that there a lot of important, very important critical regional events that have occurred around the world. And accordingly, there’s going to be price increase in those areas. And certainly in these affected areas, in some cases, it will be substantial increases. But and we also recognize, by the way, to your point, there's more pressure on the system than ever before around rate declines. But overall, the facts indicate that unless there's another event or series of events, the industry's going to have excess capital and that, that remaining supply, demand imbalance is going to continue to put downward pressure on price. Particularly, in the non-affected areas which happen to be, in this case, much, much larger than the affected areas. In the example, you described on the Reinsurance analysis what our colleagues have done is literally calculate it bottom up literally brick by brick the capital in the industry. And it's roughly $470 billion as of the year-end 2010 which was a 17% increase over 2009. It really is that supply/demand imbalance, Jay, that's led us to basically say, "Look, there's clearly, less slack in the system than maybe there has been for a long time," but we see that supply demand imbalance remaining at a reasonable level. And I would just finally say, our GRIP data suggests that, if you sort of looked at our pipeline over the next 30, 60, 90 days, and it also indicates continued decreases in price. Albeit at a lower level, want to make sure I'm highlighting that. It's a lower level, but not the turns that others have talked about. So hopefully that's helpful.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: It’s very helpful, Greg. And just on GRIP, are you talking about primary commercial, as well as Reinsurance? Or just...
Greg Case: Well, the GRIP really is primary commercial. So I'm trying to give you 2 perspectives, one on the Reinsurance side, and one on the primary side, given the importance of the topic. And GRIP, literally look at it as 1 million trades, it's not the market, but it literally is our entire market. So and it's pretty extrapolatable to the overall market and it’s the specific data which shows exactly what happened in the first quarter and then it literally has all the indications in it for the foreseeable future.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: And that $470 billion, you're saying that's dedicated Reinsurance capital globally?
Greg Case: Yes, exactly. The analysis, by the way, happy to send it to you, you can also access it on our website, is we did our level best to identify dedicated Reinsurance capital around the world and that's how we got to the $470 billion.
Operator: Next question, Matt Heimermann, JPMorgan.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Couple questions, just specifically in HR Solutions on the traditional Consulting side, I'm just curious if you could maybe break down what you're seeing in terms of growth between maybe the less discretionary lines which I would think about being kind of health and benefits actuarial, investment, Consulting and then the discretionary of kind of talent, compensation, leadership?
Greg Case: Well, essentially, we're actually seeing growth across the board but what you do see is the areas that we’re really impacted by the economy, talent, comp, et cetera, those are really beginning to bounce back. We see that as very positive. Things that involved, Matt, discretionary spend during the last few years have really been under pressure. Our colleagues have done a great job in those businesses, but now as the economy has leveled off or even in some cases looks like it might even be coming back a bit, we're seeing real upticks in those businesses. And the others that were actually holding a bit more during the downturn, are doing just fine, but they don't see as much of an uptick.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And so as we think about what might happen with growth there, it's more likely we should think about those discretionary areas pulling the growth rate up more so than much of a change in the other areas?
Greg Case: Well, in the other areas, it'll just be more gradual in the other areas. The uptick will be more acute and more positive on the areas that involve discretionary spend, but we're investing to see it in both sides. And we've got, again, great capability on both sides and we see positive movement really on the discretionary and some of the things that were more recurring.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And then if we kind of dovetail that same question into Outsourcing with respect to project revenues, is it fair to think about the timeline there maybe being a little bit drawn out than what we might see in some of the discretionary areas in the Consulting side?
Christa Davies: That's right, Matt, because of the long-term nature of the contract. The only thing I would note is, as employment levels increase, they do flow through the Outsourcing contracts with a month lag. And so employment levels have significant upside leverage to that revenue base. The project related sort of revenue year-over-year will stabilize really in Q2.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a couple numbers questions, if I could, just, Christa, just the pension expense or benefit in the quarter. And then also, can you just tell us what the common outstanding shares were at the end of the quarter?
Christa Davies: So the pension expense for the year, Matt, it's down slightly in 2010. And it's roughly the same per quarter, is the way I think about it. And then contribution levels on pension, we did say were about $400 million for the year and again roughly equal by quarter. And then common shares outstanding were 330.5 million as at March 31.
Operator: Next question, Dan Johnson, Citadel.
Dan Johnson - Citadel Investment Group: You mentioned that in your prepared remarks your outlook on the Reinsurance business. I can't recall the exact word you used, but I didn't think it implied much change from the current level of, I think, we put up a 0 this quarter. Is that characterization correct?
Greg Case: Well, I think, Dan, I would say, we're continuing to build and working to grow that business. But we essentially characterize it as sort of over the next 12 months, sort of roughly positive but we did not dramatically positive.
Dan Johnson - Citadel Investment Group: Sure. That sounds like a decent uptick from last quarter where I think it was minus one, but the expectations were for something that looked a little bit more like 2010, which was a minus 3. If all this math is right, what sort of led to, I guess I'll call it, an improvement in the outlook?
Greg Case: Well, listen, getting back, we've been try to pretty measured about this and will always do that as is our practice. We believe we'll see continued improvement here. I wouldn't say it's a dramatic change. It's really sort of roughly the overall same outlook. Again, as we said before, certain aspects of the business on the fact side and on the capital markets side, Cap bond, et cetera, tend to be a bit lumpy so it sometimes a little more positive and little negative and we'll highlight that in the process. But essentially, this is a business in which we think demand is going to continue to increase. The events around the world have actually highlighted that. And it will be reflected in our overall business. But we just see solid progress for 2011.
Dan Johnson - Citadel Investment Group: Okay. And then in terms of the Brokerage margins, do you have any visibility on any further sort of one-timers, if you will, like we saw this quarter with the lease termination?
Greg Case: We really don't and I would highlight again, on the lease termination in France, for us, that really for us was just an investment in our colleagues around the world. This is something that in the context of what we're trying to do with Aon united and really bring our global firm together, deliver for our clients in a very local way. Our colleagues in France have just done a remarkable job, Robert Le Blanc, Laurent, Michel, and all the colleagues there have done a great job and really it's an investment we wanted to make to get our business back closer into kind of central Paris. And it's something we talked about for quite some time and we believe that it's is going to help our business long term. And we made the investment. We always do that to strengthen our business and our business lets us make these investments and absorb it and that's exactly what we did in the context of Q1. And we don't see anything more on the horizon, but I wanted you to understand why we did it and the psychology behind it.
Dan Johnson - Citadel Investment Group: Yes, understood. And then last quick one on the commission compliance efforts, I forgot exactly which program that falls under, but any update you could add there as to sort of how that has helped profitability versus what you think it could do and sort of maybe what inning we're in I guess in that effort?
Greg Case: Great question. This really relates back to kind of Aon Broking, so if you really think about how we're going to grow our business, we're going to take a number of steps to really bring new clients in and get a greater share of wallet with them, a la what we’re doing on the revenue engine in Client Promise. And then we're also going to work to, in the context of that, as we get them the best deals out there in the world, best terms and conditions, best price, we're also going to work to make sure we get a fair and appropriate kind of yield per dollar of premium placed. And that really is our Aon Broking effort. That's what you're describing. And we're in the early innings of that still. In the 9-inning baseball game, if you want to use that analogy, we're kind of still in the third or fourth inning, early innings, it's beginning to actually have some benefit for us. We're excited about that. We can see how that's going to play out for us over time in a very positive way, but that's really still early innings and but we're quite excited about it. That combination of new clients and again, we had a great, great quarter from a new client, new business standpoint, grew at 11% across the board which is fantastic for us, feel good about that. Very good on the retention side and we think this one you're describing or highlighting, Dan, is a very important one for us as we continue to increase yield per dollar of premium placed.
Dan Johnson - Citadel Investment Group: And you see it as a contributor to 2011 profitability or is this more of a 2012 and beyond sort of effort?
Greg Case: No, we see it as having meaningful impact as we get into the second half of 2011 and then really kicking in, in '12 and '13.
Operator: Our last question comes from Scott Scher, Clovis Capital.
Scott Scher - Clovis Capital Management: All my questions have been answered.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
Greg Case: I just wanted to say to all of our investors and partners on the phone, thanks for taking part and we appreciate your support in Aon.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Before making any boding or investment decision, investors and stockholders are argue to read carefully in its entirety, the definitive joint proxy statement, prospects regarding the proposed transaction and any other relevant documents filed by either Aon or Hewitt with the SEC when they became available. They will contain important information about this proposed transaction.  Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President, and CEO of Aon Corporation. Sir, you may begin.
Greg Case: Thanks a very much and good morning everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2010 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. To begin, this was an incredibly exciting quarter. Highlighted by the recent announcement of our pending merger with Hewitt creating Aon Hewitt a global leader in human capital solutions and in addition to that the beginning of our four year partnership Manchester United which will substantially strengthen Aon brand recognition around the globe. Against this backdrop these great highlights our team is proud to deliver results, that represent a strong quarter a continued progress and momentum. As we have said before, irrespective of economic conditions, the soft market or other challenges outside our control we continue to execute our plans to substantially strength our firm, positioning Aon as the preeminent global professional services firm in the world focused on risk and human capital solutions. Consistent with our previous quarterly updates I would like cover three areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key commitments to shareholders, second is continued areas of investment across Aon including the brief update on the progress of Aon Hewitt and third is overall organic growth performance. On the first topic our performance versus commitments, each quarter we measure our performance against the three metrics we committed to shareholders to achieving over the course of the year. To grow organically expand margins and increase earnings per share. In the second quarter, organic revenue declined 1% and improvement from a negative 3% in the prior quarter as consulting delivered positive organic revenue for the first time since Q1 of 2009 and brokerage delivered significant improvement with organic growth coming from key areas such as Latin America, Asia Pacific and benefits from our GRIP platform. Adjusted operating margin increased a110 basis points, highlighted by a 200 basis point improvement in brokerage as strong operational performance offset a modest decline in organic revenue and fiduciary investment income. EPS on an adjusted basis increased 7% to $0.81 representative of strong operational performance and effective capital management in a challenging environment. Overall, a solid quarter of operational performance as we continue to build and strengthen our client serving capabilities focused on what we believe are two of the most important topics in the global economy today. Risk and people what we believe, we are exceptionally well positioned to capture this opportunity. On the second topic further areas of investment, we believe we are in a unique position. Solid operating performance combined with expense discipline and a strong balance sheet continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities. While we have got significant opportunity remain to deliver cost savings under our restructuring programs, we continue to build on our leadership position and industry leading capabilities. Just a few examples, in brokerage, we're investing in innovative technology such as our global risk insight platform and Fact Connect to ensure the clients have seamless access of best of global Aon in every local region around the globe. In fact, GRIP recently completed its 500,000 trades highlighting a unique value of this platform. We are also investing in additional capability as risk continues to increase in size and complexity around the globe. With acquisitions such as Allied North America, and FCC Global strengthening our industry leading construction capabilities as well as the acquisition of Carpenter Moore strengthening our capabilities and professional liability. We are also investing client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the roll out of the revenue engine in EMEA and Asia Pacific, already on Broking platform to better match client needs to ensure appetite or risks and client promise which is driving greater retention rates and ensuring clients fully understand our value proposition in a completely transparent way.  And we are just beginning to realize the positive impacts of these investments; we believe we will begin to see increasingly greater benefits as a we move into 2011 and 2012. In consulting we recently completed the acquisition of JPMorgan's compensation and benefits business strengthening our intellectual capital in key areas including pension actuarial and advisory services with over 150 colleagues in key markets across the U.S. In addition, we continue to invest in key leadership globally with senior leaders hired across practice areas including health and benefits, retirement and management consulting both in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. And of course, subsequent to the volumes of the second quarter, we announced that Aon and Hewitt signed a definitive agreement under which Hewitt will merge with a subsidiary of Aon, Aon Consulting and upon close of the transaction the segment will operate globally under newly created Aon Hewitt brand. Together we will combine a portfolio of innovate products and services focused on what we believe again are two the most important topics in the global economy today, risk and people. The Hewitt which is where the strength in consulting benefits administration and HR business process outsourcing and Aon Consulting will strengthen employee benefits, retirement and global compensation, just to name a few areas will truly create a global leader in human capital solutions. Since the announcement we've had the opportunity to meet with a significant number of shareholders and we're pleased with the positive reception and support we received. Equally important is the report we received from a number of our middle market and large corporate clients, including Fortune 100 clients who have already reached out to Aon as they recognize the breadth and depth of the Aon Hewitt product and services capabilities both close. I'd also like to update you on the progress we're making with our integration planning which is already well underway. As previously announced, Aon Hewitt will be led by Rust Fradin, Hewitt's Chairman and CEO. Our team is truly exited to work with Rust and the entire team from Hewitt. An integration team comprised of leaders from both companies has been formed and has been led by Greg Besio, Aon's head of global strategy and our CAO. We've got a team in place and we're approaching integration in a way that will ensure that we begin operating on day one, post close in the strongest position possible. Lastly, regarding key steps necessary to close the transaction, we filed for regulatory approval with HSR on July 23rd, filed our join proxy and prospectus on July 26 and are currently in progress with filing our EU regulatory approval. In short we are progressing as quickly as possible and are fully on track to close the transaction by mid-November following shareholder approval by both companies. And while we're here today to take questions regarding our quarterly results, we thought it was important to briefly update you on the progress we're making on the proposed merger. We fully expect to update you going forward on a regular basis as appropriate regarding any significant developments related to the merger. In summary, on the topic of investments across both brokerage and consulting, our fundamental client serving capability continues to strengthen around the world. These investments fully funded in the context of continued margin improvement position Aon very well to take advantage of a changing global economy. And finally on the third topic o growth, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the quarter for both our brokerage and consulting segments. In brokerage overall organic revenue for the segment declined 1% with improvement from previous quarters in both retail and reinsurance. In retail we had strong growth geographically in Latin America and Asia Pacific and in benefits related to our GRIP platforms. This offset continued pressure from lower exposures, reduced discretionary spend and the impact of pricing which was down mid single digits on average globally. In reinsurance, excess capital and generally positive loss experience continue to drive higher seeing retentions and soft pricing globally. And against these challenging head wins which are primarily market related we're driving a set of initiatives that continue to strengthen our underlying performance and give us confidence that our brokerage business is well positioned for long term growth. With retention rates 90% or better on average including U.S. retail which posted its highest quarter ever at 93% highlighting strong client satisfaction. New business generation of approximately 200 million in our retail brokerage business are up mid-single digits, really from the diversified markets around the globe including Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, Africa, Italy and China, highlighting just some of the strengths of our global client serving capability. And investments in capability are the roll out of GRIP, Fact Connect and impact on demand across our brokerage platform. Turning to the individual areas across our brokerage business, in the Americas organic revenue increased 2% versus the prior year quarter. Results reflected significant improvement from a negative 5% decline in Q1. We saw strong growth in both Latin America and in benefits related to out GRIP platform. We also saw improvement in our key construction services portfolio with a pipeline of infrastructure projects is very encouraging. And while we still expect pressure for both the economy and soft pricing on our renewal book, we anticipate continued modest growth underlying trends highlight the work put in place over the last year to drive improved performance from pipeline management, productivity improvements client service enhancements and increased commissions. Turning now up to Europe, Middle East, and Africa, EMEA, organic revenue decreased 3% we saw strong growth in new business across the region in areas such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Africa more than off set by continued economic weakness and pressure on the renewal book in Continental Europe and Ireland. Pricing was down low single digits on average and heavy export countries. Continue to be impacted by lower exposure units. Again we've got 90% plus retention rates and leadership positions across those markets in Europe with stability in key countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy, as we've noticed the last few quarters, fragile economic conditions will continue to make results across the entire region lumpy on a quarterly basis, but we would expect modest improvement in the second half of the year. Turing to U.K. organic revenue declined 6%, we're able to generate new business growth in a number of areas such as crisis management, space and power and other areas, however lower exposures compounded by soft pricing continue to have an unfavorable impact on the renewal deck of the region in a number of areas such as financial institution and marines among other. Fragile economic conditions will continue to make results across the region lumpy, on a quarterly basis as we said before. Turning to Asia Pacific organic revenue was plus 3%, results reflect continued improvement compared to the prior quarter and the highest rate of organic growth since Q4, 2008. We saw growth in a number of key markets including Australia and New Zealand as well as strong growth in a number of markets including Taiwan and Singapore. These results were partially offset by continued economic weakness in Japan and political instability in Thailand. Turning to reinsurance, organic revenue was negative 3% and the results reflect a modest improvement from the prior quarter. Higher cedent in retentions and soft pricing globally were partially offset by growth in capital markets transactions. If you break down organic performance for the quarter, impact of the market drove a negative 5% organic decline and these were driven by higher seed in retentions and soft pricing globally as the as the industry continues to be over capitalized. Partially offset by capital market transactions which drove the positive 2% organic revenue. We'd expect to see continued pressure at a similar rate on the reinsurance book for the forcible future driven by week market conditions, partially offset by growth in faculty and even capital markets transactions, which again tend to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. Finally turning to our consulting segment, organic revenue increased 2%, a solid improvement from the prior quarter and the first quarter of positive organic growth since Q1 2009, we saw strong participation for a selected global compensation surveys and our compensation consulting business and growth in our international health and benefits business also drove improved results. As economic conditions stabilize around the globe on average, we'd expect to see continued modest growth driven by an encouraging pipeline in compensation that's helping and an increase in discretionary related work and new services such as the Dependent Eligibility Audits. And additionally we have fully integrated our JPMorgan compensation and benefits acquisition that was completed in the first quarter and this again strengthens our benefits consulting intellectual capital in key areas including pension actuarial and advisory services. Taking a step back and thinking about our second quarter overall, we believe we delivered solid progress against our core commitment to shareholders and while we continue to face head wins in the broader economy we are driving a set of initiatives that are delivering core operational improvement positioning Aon for a long-term growth with greater client serving capability and effectively allocating capital to maximize shareholder value creation. Now I am pleased to turn the call over to Christa Davies for the financial review. Christa?
Christa Davies:  Thanks so much Greg and good morning everyone. As Greg noted our second quarter results reflect continued to progress to strengthen our industry leading positions and client serving capabilities across risk and human capital. With simultaneous improvement in each of our three key financial metric. The rate of organic revenue improved in both segments from the prior quarter. Strong expense discipline drove significant operating margin expansion and EPS from continuing operations showed solid growth. Now let me turn to the results from second quarter, GAAP EPS of continuing operations was $0.63 per share for the second quarter. Our core EPS performance reflected in an adjusted EPS of $0.81 per share for the second quarter up 7% compared to $0.76 in the prior year quarter. The difference between GAAP and our adjusted EPS is $31 million or $0.08 per share of restructuring charges and a non-cash charge to pension expense of 49 million or $0.10 per share which resulted from an adjustment for the market related value of planned asset to properly reflect the merger of two U.S. pension plan in 1999. This adjustment has no material impact on funded status of plans, pension expense or expected contribution for the year. Also included in the results foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of approximately $0.02 per share on adjusted EPS results. As we look at translation impact for the second half of 2010 we would anticipate a very modest unfavorable impact on EPS subject to movements in foreign currency. Now let me talk about each of the segments. In our brokerage segment against an organic revenue decline of 1% we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 21% up 200 basis points from the prior year quarter. Our performance for the quarter continues to demonstrate strong operation discipline and structural margin improvement positioning the segment to greater operating leverage as economic conditions begin to improve around the globe. Adjusted brokerage operating income increased 11% or $34 million to 334 million. The year-over-year margin benefited by significant savings related to our restructuring programs and operational improvements. Partially offset by a 100 basis point decline related to the decline in organic revenue and a 30 basis point decline related to lower producer investment income. Let me spend a moment on each of the restructuring program. Key initiatives that are enabling entire funding investments and delivering further long-term margin expansion. With respect to the 2007 restructuring program we achieved approximately a 113 million in savings in the second quarter primarily in the brokerage segment through workforce reduction. This compares to a 110 million in the first quarter and 51 million in the prior year quarter. We incurred $25 million of charges in the quarter and have approximately $4 million of total charges remaining under the program which we expect complete in the third quarter. With respect to the Aon Benfield restructuring program we achieved approximately $24 million of savings in the second quarter primarily through workforce reduction. This compared to $22 million in the first quarter and $10 million in the prior year quarter. We incurred $6 million of charges in the quarter and have approximately $30 million of total charges remaining under the program of which we currently expect a majority to be completed in the second half of the year. Overall we continue to ahead of original schedule on our restructuring programs. We have completed 96% of the charges as at the end of the second quarter yet we still have approximately 168 million of incremental brokerage savings or 29% still to achieve under these two programs between now and the end of 2011. There are five key initiatives that will drive growth in brokerage margins 25%. The first are the restructuring savings and other operational improvement initiatives. The second is the continued roll out of the revenue engine. The third is Aon Broking. All three of these are within our control. In addition there are two initiatives that will improve margins based on the external market improving. These are the improvements in the economy, specifically short term interest rates and GDP growth and the last one is improvements in insurance pricing. I would note in the first half of 2010 against the decline in organic revenue of 2% in brokerage, operating margins have expanded 90 basis points to 20.8%. Turning to the consulting segments, organic revenue decreased 2% and we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 14.8%, a 20 basis point decrease from the prior year quarter. Adjusted consulting operating income increased 4% or $2 million to $47 million. Margins were relatively similar to the prior year quarter when excluding the impact of foreign currency as organic revenue growth and benefits related to the restructuring program were offset by investments in key talent to drive long term growth opportunities. I would note in the first half of 2010 with flat organic revenue, our industry leading operating margins have expanded 20 basis points to 16.1%. Now let me discuss the unallocated income and expenses. Unallocated results including other income were a pretax loss of 57 million compared to a pretax loss of 32 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $7 million due to a higher average interest rate on our unsecured noted placed in July 2009. The prior year quarter benefitted from $9 million of income related to the company's ownership and certain insurance investment bonds and the extinguishment of certain trust preferred securities. We will continue to expect approximately $5 million per quarter of interest income and $65 million of total unallocated interest expense. Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on continuing operations was 27.5% when excluding the non cash charge to pension expense similar to the prior year quarter. We will continue to anticipate an underlying tax rate on continuing operations of 28% going forward. Turning to shares, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 10.1 million to 282.6 million in the second quarter due to the company's share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30 were 269.7 million, compared to 269.4 million at March 31. During the quarter the company repurchased $50 million or 1.2 million shares at average purchase price of $41.03 per share and issued approximately 1.5 million, primarily performance based incentive plans. The company has approximately 165 million of remaining authorization under the 2005 share repurchase program and $2 billion under the share repurchase program. We would not expect to repurchase any shares until a proposed merger with Hewitt is completed. Upon close of the transaction we will be free to continue a share repurchase. Now let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow segments to discus our financial flexibility. Cash and short term investments were approximately 734 million, unchanged from the prior quarter as cash flow from operations was primarily offset by restructuring payments, share repurchase and contributions related to our pension plans. Based on recent negotiations with trusties with certain new U.K plans and the impact of foreign currency we now expect to contribute 278 million through our pension plans in 2010, of which we have contributed approximately a $114 million year-to-date. Total debt outstanding at June 30 was $2 billion and debt- to-capital was 26.6%, down modestly from 28% in the prior quarter. Turning to cash flow from operations, we excluded the impact of the change in funds sold on behalf of clients because it has no impact on cash. Cash flow from operations for the first half of 2010 was $239 million, a significant increase compared to cash usage of 16 million in the prior year's first half. In summery, Q2 showed organic revenue improvement in both brokerage and consulting despite economic weakness and continued soft market conditions. However against these head wins we are continuing to focus on cost management, executing our restructuring program that have substantial savings yet to deliver and strategically investing in long term growth opportunities. Our balance sheet is strong and strong cash flow provides excellent liquidity and significant financial flexibility as we dive value creations to improve business results and effective capital management. With that I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be delighted to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Keith Walsh. Please state your company name.
Keith Walsh - Citi: Hi good morning everybody. It's Keith Walsh from Citi. First question I guess for Christa and/or Greg, around the expenses, listening to some of the other conference calls this quarter, it seems that the natural inflationary lifting comp is coming back again and maybe if you could talk to this issue a little and then thinking about it specially excluding your large cost saving program, what is the natural rate of organic growth really needed going forward to be margin neutral versus say the last two years?
Christa Davies: Yeah, so if you think about out expense cycle, you will see a very large portion of our expenses Keith our people and if you think about the fundamental sort of inflationary pressure on that, it's probably around 2%. So if you think about sort of the neutralizing, which I think is the old sort of question, it would be 2% and obviously we've said that we think have sort of growth rate longer term is a couple of hundred basis points above GDP. So that gives us substantial operating leverage over that base.
Keith Walsh - Citi: Okay and the second question for Greg. You guys are the best our there given the professional liability advice to your clients. But with all due respect, you don't seem to be taking that advice for your own business and I guess the question would be, where do you stand on this issue of liability caps and why haven't we seen a much more aggressive policy towards implementing them like your rival Marsh has done? Thanks.
Greg Case: Keith thanks for the questions. We have obviously though a lot about the limitation liability point that you're raising and from our standpoint as we always knew we said it a lot of time with our clients talking about it during their views, reflections of perspectives on it and as we continue to evaluate it we want to make sure we are always giving the best solution for them possible but in the context of that obviously we have got in the folds of time make sure we are mindful of the risk that Aon takes from a balance sheet standpoint and we are not in a position as you are highlighting to take balance sheet risk, that's just not the business we are in. We are in a wide space business and so you can look for us in the second half of the year. They will be taking a more proactive stance on this as we think about serving our clients as effectively we can but also protecting the Aon balance sheet in the context of what we do. Those were great question.
Keith Walsh - Citi: So, I would assume just from your answer that you have been in discussions on this and you do have potentially some things to talk about with respect to this going forward.
Greg Case:  That's absolutely correct and you can look for us in the second half of the year. We will be taking a much stronger stance on this and doing so in a way that we want to try to be as client adapted and client friendly as possible but also at the same time again making sure we are mindful of our balance sheet and what we do and again as you are really highlighting we are in advice business not balance sheet business and we are going to make sure we are going to make sure we protect against the liabilities that come with that.
Keith Walsh - Citi: Great thanks a lot.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen. Your line is open and please state your company name.
Jay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Greg I was wondering in your consulting business are you seeing any increased demand yet due to the healthcare reform that has been put in place.
Greg Case:  Jay we are really just starting to see the grasp on that. From our standpoint if you step back and think about sort of what the implications of this could be overtime we do believe there is going to be, there is real opportunity here. As we said before you take a step back and say is there going to be healthcare, yes. Is there going to be some version of employer coverage of that, some way, shape or form, we believe that's going to be yes certainly for the foreseeable future and the context of that is that healthcare bill get some clarity and still there is some lack in clarity and exactly if you look like our clients are very, very interested in understanding how they can actually get themselves prepared for that. As an example we have been holding webcast over the course of last six, seven months. We have held six webcast, over 6000 folks join that, employees that and it's actually very, very positive. Ten seminars, 115 participants come to that specific client is very, very positive. In the context of what we have done we think there is a lot of opportunity, we are just beginning to see the tip of that and obviously we feel strongly about this opportunity given some of the other announcements we made recently in the context of what we are trying to do.
Jay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Got it.
Greg Case: It's not showing up in the quarter right now. We are just starting to see this break a bit.
Jay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Got it and then second question, Greg, I am wondering if you can talk about the reaction you have gotten from your clients in regard to the announcement you made on contingent compensation. 
Greg Case: Well Jay as we have done very, very carefully much of the same conversation we had on the whole conversation of limited liability. I have really spent time to talking to clients quite extensively. Steve McGill and our entire team on the retail side I think they have done an exceptional job and they have spent really many months spending time with clients on how they think about this, how they go through it, prospectus it and et cetera, and we have actually had a very muted reaction at this point in terms of sort of what we were going to announce. Remember it's not that surprising, if you think about how we think about compensation and for us this is not about contingent it is very much around value to price. We have essentially said to clients we will be the highest value in the industry. We will absolutely pursue a set of capabilities that will deliver value. We may cost a dollar but we'll deliver $2. The client, somebody else, another competitor might be much cheaper, say $0.50 but they're going to deliver $0.52 as an example and our clients really understand that and really appreciate sort of the value approach we take. In terms of the forms of remuneration, as we've said before, the key part of this is really transparency, making sure they understand the value they receive and the price they pay for it and we led the industry around transparency. And back in July 2008 Steve McGill testified on the context of continued commissions and we said at the time, look there is not -- this is not an irreconcilable conflict. Transparency is the absolute key to this. And as we've talked to clients about it they fully understand it. I'd also just remind you again, if you think about sort of the history of continued commissions, they've never been a huge thing for Aon. If you go back to the last time they were really reported in business insurance and look at the top 20 takes of contingent commissions, on the top 20 we were very much at the tail, 19 or 20 on the ranking list. Some other prominent folks out there were much, much higher on the list at time like number one, number two, number three and they just have never been a huge part of what we've done. What we essentially said is look, they are out there, they are available and as we talk to clients and markets, if it makes sense we'll take them, if it doesn't we wont. But again it's not an overwriting factor for us either way. It's very much around value of the price and how we deliver that for clients.
Jay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Got it, thanks for the response.
Greg Case: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields. Your line is open and please state your company name.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks good morning, its Stifel Nicolaus.
Christa Davies: Hey Meyer.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Good morning all. I'm sorry. In the press release Greg you made mention of the benefits coming from the GRIP platform. I feel some of that is commission leakage. I was hoping you could sort of expand on that a little bit.
Greg Case: Yeah, I think really, as we're really talking about here, if you take a step back and think about all the initiatives we've been driving around, that's really the category of Aon Broking. Efforts to really think about our broad based approach and as we think and talk to clients and we talk to markets, just making it absolutely clear that in the context as we deliver value to clients and place premiums that we get the delivery on the market front that markets have agreed to. So its essentially a way to think about reduction of leakage and leakage again for us is defined as, if a market has promised 10% and they pay us less than that its just really trying to reconcile the difference between the two and we've made a number of investments in the context of Aon Broking around that, both in sort of how we understand our system, which is really what the Global Risk Insight Platform is about. It really is just understanding every trade we make in the system globally everyday in a real time basis. This has been a multi year investment. It's given us tremendous capability that we didn't have before and lets us be able to evaluate leakage, it helps us really monitor and manage the Broking. It gives us market insights. It helps us understand the kind of penetration we're having with clients and how we think about that. So it's really a whole range of things we've done really across our overall system. For us the GRIP is really a, the Risk Insight Platform is really an engine. It gives us a very unique use of view on data and we don't think anybody else has. It provides an opportunity for us to both talk to clients around greater benchmarking than they've ever seen before. It also gives us the opportunity to talk to markets and create a fee based offering to the extent it can help markets understand situations and their strategy better. So it really gives us a full range of things we can do and we've now got it implemented in 20 countries around the world, roughly $33 billion of premium flow rented in the system. As I mentioned in my opening comments 500,000 trades have been placed or monitored and its really, for us its an overall sort of efforts that have begun, just beginning to kind of really pay dividends across the Aon Broking Platform.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, and second if you change direction a little bit, there have been some news reports about Aon trying to retain a business that has historically since third party wholesalers and I was hoping you could to that a little bit.
Greg Case: Yeah for us this is really a back kick. It really relates to the previous question you had and it was really around the concept of how we actually think about our overall business. From our stand point we have what we believe a really -- the most unique set of capabilities in the world in what we do and how we place products and how we approach that everyday and what we've essentially said is we want to absolutely make sure we protect our clients and give them the best insight and the best available placing capability around the world and we also in the context when we just described around Aon broking created a set of opportunities that really helps us measure, manage and monitor the over all process which the Risk Insight Platform does and all we really did was just highlight that we were going to do that more and more on behalf of our clients and as such kind of restrict to what we do outside of that over all network because we think it's in the best interest of our clients.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from Jay Gelb; your line is open and please state your company name.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital thanks. Greg or Christa, two questions for you. First, can you talk about the timeframe of which to achieve the 25% margin in brokerage? That's the first one and then second is, I now Aon is starting off with a very low base or maybe nothing currently at contingent commissions, but I think investors are really interested in having a sense of how much you feel you can collect over what sort of time frame? Thanks.
Christa Davies: Good Jay, in terms of our 25% brokerage margin, obviously we are very committed to that margin and very much in the same way we were committed to the 20% margin and we put it out there as long term goal. We have not given a timeframe around that goal, what we have said is that there are five key drivers to get to that goal. The first three are within our control and they are, number one sort of operating improvements of which we still have substantial savings for our restructuring and program, yet to flow through, in fact a168 million of saving yet to flow through in brokerage. The second one is the continued roll out of the revenue engine, particularly in APAC and EMEA, which is driving substantial improvements in revenue both improve retention rates and expended new business. The third one is Aon broking which as Greg has described is sort of quiet holistic around the way we think about sort of market and developing capabilities to better match, ensure appetite for risk and client needs. We believe that we can make substantial progress on just those three initiatives within under our control and in addition there are two sort of initiatives that really are based on market improvements and sort of the head wins we are currently facing, the first and most significant one is GDP and improved short term interest rates as you know a hundred basis points improvement in interest rate it's 35 million dollars top line and bottom line and then the last one is insurance pricing and we have continued to say, we do not need insurance pricing to turn around to get to the 25% margin long term. We are incredibly committed to delivering that margin long term.
Greg Case: And so I think, Jay what you see in the contest is the three things under our control that Christa just described is really is our blueprint to kind of march towards 25% and we are going to do that. The other two, we don't think -- it can get much worst, we'll see, they could potentially could I guess. But we think potentially could be real tail wins to the extent they would be kick in either in the economy or insurance pricing either one, other wise the former, the economy is much more powerful than insurance pricing just for reference.
 :
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Thanks and then on the margin, if at some point if you can even just give us a range whether it's three years or five years or longer in terms when to get there I think it will be helpful.
Greg Case:  We understand.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Johnson. Your line is open and please state your company name.
Dan Johnson - Citadel:  Citadel, thanks for taking the questions. Good morning. Just a couple please, good morning. Can we talk a little bit about the North American brokerage performance maybe couple of things, can you touch on how things are going in the sort of new loss retention sort of pipeline front and anything specific you can add on maybe the U.S. side of the North American franchise and then I do have one follow up.
Greg Case:  Yeah Dan thanks for the question. Obviously, we felt very good sort of continued progress there on the overall Americas front up 2% for the quarter, slightly improvement over the prior quarters and part of this by the way is really which to the development of the programs we put in place in North America and the Americas. We just feel better and better about this, whether it is a revenue engine, what's been put in place or all the stuff we're doing around in Broking put in place. We started with the U.S. and now we are rolling out for the rest of the world. We think this actually bodes very well for what's happening and happened across the world. But the overall story really for us is as you think about our ability to improve share, increased share and grow the business ultimately, hold exactly as we said over the last number of quarters. First from a new business standpoint we continue to do exceptionally well. We are winning in a two to one pace. We continue to win on a two to one pace in the first half of '10 and as we look at the larger situation 669 opportunities give or take. We on 456 or about 68 or 69, 70% of those, that's holding very, very well for us Dan, we are exceptionally feel very, very good about sort of the new business win opportunities. I described new business generation across the globe but I just described was really more U.S. based if you look at across the growth in the globe, new business generation was around 200 million in the retail brokerage business up mid-single digits. I am really -- markets around the world but really from a new business standpoint we feel very, very good about what we put in place and what we are doing. We are in fact doing exceptionally well on a new business front and then you could say well that's new business what's happening in the retain book and as we have said before retention rates are 90% or better in the U.S. in particular, the highest retention rates ever at 93% and the pressure we are feeling is really on insured value that's really, it's really taking it's toll on the economy even more than insurance pricing. So, from our standpoint we think the underlying trends here if you classify kind of those performance versus health, performance was fine, good, you know good improvement but the underlying health we feel exceptionally strong about. The underlying health means we are getting new business, we are driving that, we are retaining business at unprecedented levels and then now as the economy moves around or turns around in any which way we think it gives us a lots of upside potential but the underlying fundamentals, are we winning business, yes; Are we retaining business, yes, are very strong for us.
Dan Johnson - Citadel: Greg is the organic in the U.S. book, has it gotten above positive yet?
Greg Case: It's been relatively flat, it is certainly improving on par with everything else but it has been relatively flat but I would say again. If you think about the U.S. business and in the context of what our colleagues in U.S are doing, it's actually very, very strong underlying performance. I understand we may have achieved that performance at a time when construction which as you know is a very large sector for us and even an increasing sector for us, it's been under tremendous, tremendous pressure and that pipeline is now starting to look more promising. I think you know that since Q1. Obviously M&A and PE activity, also a very, very strong sector for us across the U.S. Those two sectors were basically way down, to say it most positively and variables actually move across and through those sort of head wins to actually perform in a very solid way and again I come back to the health of the underlying U.S business with what our leadership has put in place is exceptionally strong.
Dan Johnson - Citadel: Great, thanks. And then my follow up question is on the foreign exchange front. Sometimes it's hard to tell but can you give a little or maybe some exact color on what foreign exchange impact was to the brokerage and consulting margins this quarter?
Christa Davies: Yeah, its was slightly positive impact on brokerage margins. So 40 basis points favorable and a slightly negative increase, a negative impact on consulting margins.
Dan Johnson - Citadel: Great, thank you very much.
Greg Case: Sure Dan.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Mathew Himerman. Your line is open and please state your company name.
Mathew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Hi, JPMorgan, good morning. A couple of questions. Just with respect to consulting, once the Hewitt deal gets done, when you think about the platform that you've got, should we think about that being kind of the, the kind of end state platform you want to have on consulting or should we expect you to continue to have an appetite to other practice areas over time.
Greg Case: Well Mathew, from our standpoint as we think about sort of the overall structure of Aon we feel very good about it post close, in fact very, very good about it. We end up with the partnership with Hewitt in we believe an exceptionally strong position. Hewitt brings to us an opportunity to really substantially strengthen our strategic position on the consulting front and even capital solutions give us opportunity to do a lot of cross sell which by the way we have not valued at all, in the partnership at all and just strengthens our ability, kind of in a different client, team level. That puts us in an exceptionally strong position. Also with Hewitt, as you know, it creates significant value, as we've said publicly $1.5 billion of shareholder value in a way that we think is very manageable execution risk and exceptionally strong cash generating capability, really absolutely substantially increases our cash sharing capability that we can invest back into buy back, back in the risk and other places but overall and by the way we've done that in a way that we've actually completely maintained our ratings in the context of what we try to do. So we feel very good about how that comes together and that leaves us with a structure that we think has actually positioned us quite, quite well and I wouldn't look for substantial changes beyond what we've got and the context of what we are. We really, for us it isn't about size. It's about content capability but it does leave us in a position where we are number one in risk, number one in reinsurance and number one in people. We think that's a good solid platform and what we want to do then is invest to build that platform and feel very good about that.
Mathew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay, so no real upside to extend into some of the other management consulting areas then?
Greg Case: Not at all. In fact if you think about what we've done, it's a little bit, for us we've really focused our effort really around people and risk and on the people front it's very focused around the elements that we are in and we don't see us looking to do anything broader than that. This is really around human capital and people, not management consulting, not areas such that, purely around human capital and we want to be as I said at the beginning of the call, the preeminent firm in the world focused on risk and people and that by the way, again back to our track record for the last five years, we've in fact focused our efforts. We're out of different areas of underwriting in multiple places to really focus the firm on risking people and we don't plan on broadening that view one bit post close.
Mathew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Would people focus ultimately encompass something like in the assets, a 401(k) advisory or anything like that, not necessarily the custody of potentially announced at gathering business as well which some of the peers -- which some of the competitors on actually do.
Greg Case: I think more on the -- it's more of the investment management side. If you think about Hewitt who also just announced acquisition of Ennis Knupp, great capability by the way. We're very exited about that and what Hewitt's been able to bring into the fold, a world class provider in that context. But again we see this in a very, very combined way. We will not be a balance sheet company though. We're all about professional services, doing in away again capital like advisory business, high return of invested capital in the contact that we're doing high cash flow, very much a round advice.
Mathew Heimermann - JPMorgan: And then just, what if -- taking contingent commissions, what does that mean if anything for producer compensation?
Greg Case: Well look, in the end we thought about overall compensation, it all fits into the overall packaging from our stand point. We're really focused on this from a client view point and it really doesn't impact -- it's not going to impact producer comp one way or the other. This is really around how we think about making sure what we're delivering to clients is clear, absolutely transparent. They understand the value that we're providing in every single way and doing it in a way that manages any kind of conflicts, whether perceived or real which we will absolutely manage through and really, fundamentally as we thought about performance and pay-per-performance, its really around long term performance based competition approaches which again -- contingence for us, there are lots to be made out of them but for us that's a very, very minor, minor, minor part of how we think about delivering value to clients and getting paid for it. It has been historically and will be in the future.
Mathew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Alright, thanks.
Greg Case: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you this concludes today's conference call, Mr. Case do you have any final remarks?
Greg Case: I don't other than to say again to all who joined today, we very much appreciate you being part of this and look forward to our next discussion. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.
