===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics, First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please...
Nicole Shelton: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2025 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the investor relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies. I will now turn the call over to Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning everyone and thanks to being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $3.66 per diluted share on revenue of $12.2 billion operating earnings of $1.268 million and net earnings of $994 million. These results compare quite favorably to the year ago quarter. Revenue was up 13.9%, operating earnings were up 22.4% and net earnings were up 24.4%. As a result, earnings per diluted share are up $0.78 or 27.1% more than the year ago quarter. The operating margin for the entire company was 10.4% a 70 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. While Aerospace led the way with a 45.2% revenue increase, each of the defense segment also enjoyed revenue increases. A similar pattern is true with respect to operating earnings. Aerospace led the way with a stunning 59.4% increase and each of the defense segment contributed nice improvements to operating earnings as well. We have obviously opened the year with a very strong quarter. It is important to note that the comparative quarter in 2024 also showed very good growth in all respects over first quarter 2023. We also beat consensus by $0.16 in the quarter at this point. At this point, let me ask Kim Kuryea, our CFO to provide detail on our order activity, solid backlog and cash activity before I come back with segment observations.
Kim Kuryea: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I'll start with orders and backlog. We had a solid quarter with over $10 billion of orders. Order activity was particularly strong in the Technologies Group with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 to 1. Our overall book-to-bill ratio for the company was less than one times, due in part to the 14% increase in revenue from last year. This resulted in total backlog being slightly down from year-end to $89 billion at quarter end. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at a little over $141 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter, we expected a slow start to the year. In terms of timing, this year will look a lot like last year with cash building throughout. The buildup of inventory as we approach certification and entry into service of the G800 impacted aerospace and although Technologies had a solid quarter, the defense businesses as a whole were impacted by a working capital buildup due to growth in timing. As a result, our free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $290 million. This was better than expected as our business units work to drive cash to the left. For the rest of the year, we expect modestly positive cash flow in the second quarter, followed by substantially improving free cash flow in each of the third and fourth quarters. Now to discuss capital deployment activities. Capital expenditures were $142 million, or 1.2% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year as we anticipate spending around 2% of revenue on CapEx investments in our businesses this year. Also in the quarter, we returned in excess of $980 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This included $383 million paid in dividends and repurchases of approximately 2.4 million shares of stock for $600 million at an average price of just over $252 per share. In addition, in late March we repaid $750 million of notes that matured on April 1. As a reminder, we have an additional $750 million of notes maturing in May. Although we ultimately intend to refinance those notes, the timing of when we do that maybe influenced by market conditions. When you add it all up, we ended the quarter with cash balance of around $1.2 billion and a net debt position of $8.4 billion. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $89 million compared to $82 million last year. The increase was due to utilization of commercial paper during the quarter. Finally, turning to income taxes, we had a 17.2% effective tax rate in the quarter, generally consistent with our full year guidance. Phebe that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Kim. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace did particularly well in the quarter. It had revenue of $3.03 billion and operating earnings of 432 million with a 14.3% operating margin. Revenue is $942 million more than last year's first quarter, a 45.2% increase. To give you a little color here, the increase was driven by a 50% increase in aircraft deliveries, including 13 new G700s and higher services revenue at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. The 36 deliveries in the quarter are about as planned. Recall, however, that there were no G700 deliveries in the first quarter of 2024. So this quarter really shows the robust revenue increase driven by the introduction of the G700. In addition, we saw improved margins on our G700 deliveries. In short, we expect revenue growth throughout the year, but at a slowing rate of growth because G700 deliveries began in the second quarter of last year. As I indicated last quarter, the supply chain continues to improve and is performing better to both schedule and quality. We are finding fewer faults and those we are finding are becoming easier to fix. In short, I am increasingly confident that we can meet this year's delivery plan. We are also pleased that the G800 was certified by both the FAA and EASA on April 16th. This is expected to be a smooth entry into service and we have some reason to believe that we can exceed our planned deliveries of G800. I would be remiss if I failed to mention that Jet Aviation made a significant contribution to the quarter's results. Its revenue was up 8% and earnings up 22% over the year ago quarter on 160 basis point improvement in operating margin. This business has become a real jewel. In summary, the aerospace team has had a good quarter. G800 FAA and EASA certification is behind us and we are improving our G700 delivery cadence and operating margin. Turning to market demand, we had a 0.8 book-to-bill in the quarter even as aircraft deliveries increased by 50%. Orders are consistent with our internal plan at about the same number of units as the first quarter in 2023 and 2024. We expect that the certification of the G800, it's better than plant performance characteristics and the early deliveries to customers will stimulate demand. We continue to see improved interest across all models in the U.S. albeit with cautious concern by customers about the macroeconomic environment and the impact of tariffs on their businesses. Middle East activity remains strong, so let's move on to the defense businesses. Combat had revenue of $2.18 billion, up 3.5% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $291 million are up 3.2%. Margins at 13.4% are consistent with the year ago quarter. It's interesting to observe that this year's revenue growth is on top of our first quarter 2024 growth of almost 20%, so nice compound growth. The increased revenue performance occurred at Ordnance and Tactical Systems in European land systems, land systems held steady. We also experienced good order performance. Orders in the quarter drove backlog to 16.9 billion, up 3 billion from this time a year ago. Demand for combat system products continues to be robust with particular strength in Europe. Orders for wheeled and tracked vehicles are up, reflecting the heightened threat environment. In addition to several new combat vehicle starts, we are working closely with the U.S. Army to accelerate Abrams modernization. In the U.S. we are rapidly increasing munitions capacity and production with the opening of our projectile facility in Texas and our load and assembly and PAC facility in Arkansas. All-in-all, Combat had a solid quarter and is off to a good start for the year. Turning to Marine Systems, once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me repeat the recent history that I gave you at this time last year with respect to growth in this decade. The first quarter 2020 was up 9.1% against Q1, 2019. Q1, 2021 was up 10.6% over Q1, 2020. Q1, 2022 is up 6.8% over Q1, 2021. Q1, 2023 was up 12.9% over Q1, 2022. Q1 2024 was up 11.3% over Q1, 2023. And finally, this quarter is up 7.7% over Q1.24. This has been a really nice rate of growth for the shipyards and the repair yards. This growth has come at significant cost for facilities and significant increase in hiring. The good news is we've been able to hire and train the people we require to support our growth. This particular quarter's growth was driven by Columbia Class and Virginia Class construction, as well as an increase in DDG-51 construction. Operating earnings are $250 million in the quarter, up 7.8% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin is identical to last year's quarter. We have struggled to achieve operating leverage to go with our rapid revenue growth, but operating earnings have grown on a consistent basis as well. We continue to be impacted by delays and quality problems in the supply chain. Material and parts are late and sometimes exhibit quality escapes, and new shipbuilders continue to come down learning curves. We have more work to do, but we have made progress. In addition, one of the unions, the draftsmen's, a largely white collar union that converts engineering specs to drawing has voted to authorize the strike. We are working closely with the Navy and the new administration to continue to address the problems in the supply chain and look for opportunities to improve throughput and performance at the shipyard. The growth profile continues to look strong and demand is not abated. Our job is to continue to improve ourselves and to help the industrial base get stronger with the help of the government. The Technologies Group had a strong start to the year with revenue of $3.43 billion. This was an increase of 6.8% over the first quarter of 2024. Both businesses contributed to the growth in the quarter with GDIT up 9% and Mission Systems up almost 2%. Operating earnings of $328 million were up 11.2% over the year ago quarter on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins from 9.2% to 9.6%. The operating margin improvement is encouraging given the top line shift toward IT services, which carry a lower margin than the defense electronics side of the portfolio. This reflects strong performance admission systems as the transition from legacy programs to new franchises continues. The group's order activity was also encouraging with a book-to-bill of 1.1 times for the quarter and trailing 12 months even against the strong revenue growth. As a result, the group's backlog is up almost 7% from a year ago and their total estimated contract value is up more than 10% over the same period. Their focus on advanced technology enabling autonomous platforms, smart munitions, subsea warfare and strategic deterrence as well as advanced AI, cloud, cyber 5G and quantum solutions is driving demand for the group. Their pipeline of qualified opportunities remains strong at 120 billion and their win and capture rates in the 80% range reflect the compelling value they're providing their customers. While this year is off to a strong start, a significant amount of uncertainty hangs over the market, particularly on the IT services side of the business as the administration establishes its own spending priorities. That said, our team has a great understanding of the government's emerging technology needs and is committed to innovating to solve the toughest technical challenges across the government at the best return for their customers. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of year. Apart from what I've already said about aerospace, I will continue with that practice. There is, however, no hiding from this quarter's performance and its implication for the year. Let me speak to tariffs for a moment. We cannot yet discern to what extent the defense businesses will be impacted over time. The more potentially impactful problem is in aerospace, where we are a significant net provider of export revenue to the U.S. We do not know the scope and breadth of the tariffs issue at the moment and will not for a while. Accordingly, anything I might say on that subject would be sheer speculation. So I do not intend to answer questions on the subject of tariffs because anything I say on that subject, given our lack firm of knowledge, will almost certainly be wrong. Rest assured that we are working the related issues diligently. This concludes my remarks about a good quarter and let me turn the call back to Nicole to take questions.
Nicole Shelton: Thank you, Phebe.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Peter Arment at Baird.
Peter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Phebe, Kim, Jason, Nicole. Nice results. Phebe, maybe just given in the spirit of everything that's going on, GD -- Technology Segment had a really good bookings quarter, kind of bucking the trend of the industry. Maybe could you talk a little bit about, I guess, any visibility or any discussions that GD is supporting kind of the GSA and their efforts and just, how are things looking from a bookings in a cost savings environment with the current administration?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, Peter, that's a good question. I asked Jason to join us on the call to provide us more color for those of you who wanted some. So I'll turn that over to Jason.
Jason Aiken: Thanks, Phebe, and good morning Peter. I think as you'd expect, along with a number of GDITs peers that I'm sure you've heard from, we've been in active conversation and actively working with the customer to identify opportunities for savings for increased value and so on from the services and the solutions that we provide. I think it's important to as a reminder that we are not strictly in the consulting business per se. We deliver mission driven solutions. We deliver solutions to the customer's most challenging technology issues. But the fact is we are in the conversation and as part of that conversation, we are going to partner with our customer and we are going to find the savings that they're looking for. At this point, the only thing I could comment in terms of what we're seeing in our results is you saw, you heard about the strong results in the quarter. First quarter was very strong, not only from a revenue and earnings standpoint, but also the order book was healthy. So on the one hand, we're seeing a little bit of sluggishness in the solicitation and the proposal and award process, no different than the rest of our peers. But we'll have to see how that plays out, how long that sustains and how much of that is just an impact of a new administration setting their priorities and no different than any transition we see with a new administration. So a lot still to be determined, nothing to change yet. The outlook for the year remains the same and I think we'll know a lot more by the midpoint of the year.
Peter Arment: Thanks, Jason. Thanks, Phebe.
Operator: We'll move next to Jason Gursky at Citi.
Jason Gursky: Hey, good morning. First question, Phebe maybe just get some comments from you and your take on the administration's desire to stand up, I don't know, Office of Shipbuilding inside the White House and all the efforts that we're seeing from them on supporting the industrial base here in the United States. We just look to get your take on what you're hearing.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So we've been in touch with the office. We're very happy to have the focus on shipbuilding across the enterprise. So consider that all goodness. And we've had productive conversations with multiple elements of the administration and we're working with them to see in some cases how we can accelerate throughput productivity and shore up how we can shore up the industrial base, particularly on the, on the defense side, and opportunities for more commercial shipbuilding where they may arise. So I think attention on a, on a subject of national import is always beneficial.
Jason Gursky: Okay, great. And then quick follow up question would just be on the executive orders that hit last week about the potential for seems like a rewrite of federal acquisition regulation. I just would love to get your take on, this administration's approach to procurement reform. Seems like every administration comes in and wants to reform how acquisition is done. Just curious if you think this one's going to be any different kind of potential opportunities and risks as we go through this process for the industrial base writ large. Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So I think that acquisition reform is always laudatory, and I think the extent to which it succeeds is understanding what works in the acquisition process and what doesn't. So I think that part of the dialogue we're all having is here's the good things, because there are an awful lot of good things within the process, but here are all the impediments, the cost drivers, the elements that tend to slow down or build bureaucracy. So I think that's a -- I think those are good conversations. And we've always been supportive of acquisition reform.
Operator: We'll move next to David Strauss at Barclays. Thanks.
David Strauss: Thanks, good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, David.
David Strauss: Phebe, has there been a change in kind of the order activity or customer interest, any noticeable change that you've seen at Gulfstream, post all the tariff announcements in early April, Any, any, any slowing or anything?
Phebe Novakovic: The pipeline remains good. I'd say everyone's a little bit cautious figuring out to the extent to which the tariffs will impact any one of their businesses, but the pipeline remains strong across the portfolio of products. So, so far, so good.
David Strauss: Okay. And a follow up on the marine side, can you give an update on getting the money, the significant funding that was in the CR under contract and maybe progression on, the larger Block 6, Virginia Class contract?
Phebe Novakovic: So we're working with the administration on getting the supplemental funding in the CR under contract. And so we've had very productive conversations and will continue those, so I don't think it's appropriate to talk anymore about that. But to the extent to which that we get those funds into the shipyards, into wages and additional throughput capacity, that's all beneficial in the big conversations that have to happen around Block 6 and the second build of Columbia. So the Navy intends for those to happen this year, but I think we need a lot of building blocks before we get there, including getting the supplemental under contract and starting to execute there.
Operator: Next, we'll move to Robert Stallard at Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Phebe, you said some positive things about the aerospace supply chain that you've experienced in the last couple of months, but I was wondering if in recent weeks this whole tariff thing has shifted the landscape here, particularly with regard to engines.
Phebe Novakovic: So let's just be clear about the supply chain. They've made very good progress, but the problems are not all behind us. And so we continue to work out of station work and continue to find some issues. I think it's a little soon to tell within the supply chain the extent to which we've got real concerns or their suppliers have real concerns. I would say that a lot of what we consume, internal consumption material, has a significant amount of U.S. content. So how all of this plays out is remains to be seen here.
Robert Stallard: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Kristine Liwag at Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Kristine Liwag: Jason. I want to focus on technologies a little bit. You mentioned that you're working on savings that you can provide the customer. It seems like the GSA was disappointed with the initial proposals from the industry about cost savings. So can you talk about what's the potential size of savings you could provide with the new approach and if we could size the potential effect on your revenue stream as this materializes, that'd be great. Thanks.
Jason Aiken: Yes. I'm afraid I'm going to give you an answer you're not going to be happy with. Kristine. The point is, as I said, we are in a good, healthy, active discussion with that customer. We are identifying savings. Some of that, as you might imagine, is from a conversation that's been discussed quite a bit around shifting the fixed price and outcome based type contracts, which we very much welcome. We have a good healthy portion of that in our backlog and portfolio already. But the fact is it's an ongoing dialogue with the customer. And so I think it'd be inappropriate to get out ahead of that in a public conversation and get ahead of them on that.
Kristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And then Phebe, if I could have a follow on Gulfstream. I mean you now have the G800 certified and you had previous had the G700 as well. At this point with the new products for Gulfstream coming out, it looks like there's a little uptick on the older G600s coming to market. I know you mentioned that there hasn't been significant change in demand, but I was wondering if you could provide color regarding customer behavior and how the deliveries of these newer jets are affecting the older pieces and how you expect that to play out regarding pricing.
Phebe Novakovic: It's interesting. Old is relative. He's a brand new aviator. I take your point, but a little bit of humor here. The interest in the 500 and 600 continued to be very strong. Each one has its market segment, fulfills different missions. Just so you know, an older airplane again though from a relative point of view is the 650. I think we deliver the last 650s this quarter. So that's kind of a seminal end to really an extraordinary airplane and I would say a real market changer for the last 12, 15 years. But demand remains good, the deliveries are on cadence, largely on cadence but again we still have some perturbations from the supply chain but we'll hopefully get some of those behind us as supply chain more fully recovers. I hope that answers your question.
Operator: Next, we'll move to Ken Herbert at RBC Capital Markets.
Ken Herbert: Hi Phebe and everybody, good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Ken Herbert: Nice Gulfstream deliveries in the first quarter. Phebe, sounds like supply chain is getting better. Sounds like maybe there's some incremental upside to full year expectations. But can you provide any commentary on cadence of deliveries as we think about second quarter and second half of the year from Gulfstream?
Phebe Novakovic: I think pretty consistent. We'll have some mixed changes quarter-over-quarter like we typically do, but pretty consistent. And we're sticking with our with the estimate that we gave you on the last call. As you all know, we never I think once in the last 12, 13 years have we once or twice have we ever updated in the second quarter or in the first quarter. We always wait till the second quarter. So we'll give you more clarity to the extent that there are any changes in that second quarter update.
Ken Herbert: Okay, great. And just as a follow up, you called out Middle East good order activity there. Are you seeing anything else geographically? Maybe any areas of softness or anything else that sticks out in terms of customer activity on Gulfstream?
Phebe Novakovic: Pretty much consistent with what we've seen recently. The U.S. is strong and Middle East is strong. So, so far I haven't seen any systemic changes here.
Operator: We'll move next to Scott Mikus at Melius Research.
Scott Mikus: Morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Morning.
Scott Mikus: Phebe. Quick question on Marine. General Cotton of U.S. Strategic Command recently stated that the Columbia programmer record may need to be increased given today's elevated threat environment. Considering the Navy's fleet of 14 Ohio class submarines carry 280 SLBMs, but each Columbia is only designed to carry 16 SLBMs. Is there interest from the DoD that you've heard about increasing the Columbia program to maintain a one to one replacement of SLBM launch capability?
Phebe Novakovic: That's an interesting question. That has been a national security question on and off I'd say for the last 15 years or so. So I haven't heard anything new particularly on that subject but it's frequently a question that comes up or a subject that comes up in extended conversations, so I'm sure it is on people's minds.
Scott Mikus: Okay. And then turning to Gulfstream, deliveries were very good this quarter. Were there any customers that tried to accelerate the deliveries to get ahead of the tariffs?
Phebe Novakovic: Not that I'm aware of.
Scott Mikus: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Gavin Parsons at UBS.
Gavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Gavin Parsons: Phebe, you mentioned the improvement in the G700 margin was 1Q better than your plan. And do you still expect a step down in the 2Q and 3Q margin?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, we're holding consistent for a whole series of reasons, including mips, among others, in the second quarter. Pretty much the progression that we gave you last call in January. So again, if that changes, we'll update you at the end of Q2, but so far that's still our plan.
Gavin Parsons: Okay, appreciate it. And you mentioned you expect G800 certification to drive a step up in orders there. Did you book any G800s in the first quarter?
Phebe Novakovic: We've had. Yes, I'm almost certain we did. And we've had certainly additional interest since the since the certification. It's a popular airplane. Let's recall that airplane is the replacement for the 650. 650s, as I noted, leave, it's out of production at the end of this quarter. It's already out of production actually largely, and we're in the delivery mode. So the last delivery will be this quarter, so that'll be an additional, I think stimulant to demand.
Operator: And we'll move to our next question from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning everyone.
Phebe Novakovic: Morning, Seth.
Seth Seifman: I wanted to ask in Marine, just starting off with the 7% margin kind of slightly higher than what was initially expected for the year and potentially, bringing those last two Block five boats, well, hopefully bringing those boats under contract this year, we'll see about the rest. Does that create maybe a little bit less risk when we think about the margin outlook for Marine versus the past two years?
Phebe Novakovic: I think to the extent that we can continue to stimulate through productivity in the supply chain as well as at the shipyard, that is always a risk reduction, so I think every time that we can facilitate that, that is a good thing. I will recall -- I'll just note on the 7% margin. We had a charge in the fourth quarter last year that didn't revisit and that was some mix driven. But we're staying by, you didn't ask this question, but I'll answer it anyway. But we'll stick with, as we stand today with our -- we're going to hover in the upper sixes in margin. But yes, as I said, any action on the part of the government to stimulate productivity always takes risk out of the profile.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow up on the capital deployment and balance sheet with the share repurchases in the first quarter, I guess will affect the share count for the year. I think, Kim, you mentioned maybe waiting potentially to refinance some of the debt that's due in the second quarter. Should we think about some incremental interest expense at all this year that maybe offsets some of the goodness from -- from share repo or how do I guess, how do those two things kind of net out? And then, Phebe, I think you've said over time that you're typically opportunistic on share repo and this was, a bigger quarter than we're used to seeing and so, what was kind of the thought process around that?
Kim Kuryea: Sure. I'll start with -- just to clarify, I didn't necessarily say we were waiting. We're just watching what's happening in the market in terms of the rates related to the refinancing of the debt. So just wanted to clarify on that. And as you stated, we did have significant share repurchase in the first quarter, and we continue to look at share repurchase throughout the rest of the year, depending on the facts and circumstances as they present themselves. And so I would say that we will likely have slightly more interest expense predicted for the rest of the year.
Phebe Novakovic: And I would say, too, our general attitude about capital deployment is unchanged, and our share repurchases are opportunistic, but the stock was a good buy a lot of instances this quarter.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andre Madrid at BTIG.
Andre Madrid: Good morning, everyone.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Andre Madrid: Given all the recent tension around trade, do you think there's a reluctance moving forward for allies to work with U.S. contractors? I mean -- you saw several Northern European nations kind of coming together and saying that they were intending to collectively buy a competing inventory combat vehicle. Like do we expect stuff of this magnitude kind of moving forward? And yes, like I said, do we expect trade to kind of linger and weigh on allies dealing with contractors like GD?
Phebe Novakovic: I think that we have to see how all that plays out. But we -- I think you know that we are a little bit different, and this is largely talking about combat systems because that's our preeminent business in Europe. But this is a European business run by Europeans with manufacturing facilities in Europe sourced in Europe almost exclusively. So these are long-standing 30-year in some instances companies in their home countries. So, I think we're a little bit different. I would say that the demand in the first quarter for European made sourced GD products was certainly there and European Land Systems has a superb portfolio of products to offer and we have seen increased demand and increased spending. So, that bodes well from our perspective for these businesses.
Andre Madrid: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then if I could just squeeze in one more. I think some of your peers pointed out a slower pace of contract awards in the first quarter. Did you see anything of this nature? Could you provide more color there?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. I'll not in the majority of the portfolio, but Jason, go ahead.
Jason Aiken: Yes. I think as it relates to the Technologies Group, as you saw in the results, it was actually a very encouraging quarter from an orders perspective. On a pretty meaningful uptick in revenue, we had a book-to-bill greater than 1:1. So -- so far, we're not seeing an impact through the end of the first quarter. And as Phebe said, the pipeline for the business remains very strong. The issue that I think most people are talking about, and we're seeing, frankly, the same thing is what I would refer to as perhaps a sluggishness, if you will, in the cadence of solicitations and award activity. But as a reminder, that's not necessarily something new for this business. In the GDIT side, in particular, we've talked for some time about dealing with these types of issues of protracted and drawn out adjudications and award activities, protests and other things that sort of extend that order cadence beyond what would be a regular order. So while this is something we're tracking and it's something everybody is talking about, I don't necessarily think it's something aberrationally different than what we've been used to dealing with in the past. And so we'll just have to see how it plays out as we go forward.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Phebe or Kim, maybe two follow-ups, if I can, both on margins, one on Aerospace and one on Marine. On aerospace, can you just update us on how we think about the last 650 being delivered in this quarter as the G800 grams [ph] and how we think about the different box with G700 aggressing throughout the year?
Phebe Novakovic: So we're continuing to improve G700 margins. We are not, however, at what I would call a normal cadence yet. And so once we hit that, then we will begin to progress margins even further. The 650 will deliver at high margins and the 800 will come in at higher margins than the 700 because it's not carrying as much burden as the 700 for a slot of 700. So these are all, I think, beneficial to us. And you had a question on the Marine margins?
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Yes, please. I just thought your prepared remarks mentioned the government and working with them a lot more. So I was wondering over the last quarter or two, what's really changed, whether it was the higher in cadence, the investment required from GD or is the government customer working closer with you to support the marine build-out.
Phebe Novakovic: I'd say there's a step-up in engagement on the civilian side of the government with us on building that cadence, getting the throughput up, getting productivity increases. Ensuring that we can continue to hire the workers that we have been hiring that the wage structure is appropriate and that the investments take us to the next level. And I suspect the next series of investments you'll see some investment in resiliency, a lot and, again, additional productivity and throughput with increased automation, even more increased automation. They have quite a bit that we've spent over the last decade and recently putting it in the shipyards and then additional fixtures for additional throughput so that we can really get our pace to where it needs to be, to deliver what the nation needs. And then, again, continued efforts on the part of the government to support the supply chain and get the supply chain stabilize, it's better in places, but we've got a ways to go.
Operator: We'll move next to Ron Epstein at Bank of America.
Mariana Perez Mora: This is Mariana Perez Mora, for Ron today.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Mariana Perez Mora: I wanted to do a follow-up on Combat Systems. Could you mind discussing what is the pipeline of opportunities in Europe, especially because we continue to see headlines on like increased commitment to build up their defenses?
Phebe Novakovic: So we've seen increased discussions and really throughout Europe. Eastern Europe as well as Central Europe now, and those conversations have accelerated. They started in earnest with the invasion of Ukraine, and they have picked up even more as each one of those governments has allocated an increasing amount of its resources to defense spending, so I would say it's across the board.
Mariana Perez Mora: Thank you. And my follow-up is going to be on tariff. What are your expectations for -- especially in this macro environment or evolving uncertainty? What are your expectations for book-to-bill on for full [ph] strength for the full year?
Phebe Novakovic: We are close to 1:1 for the year. I think we're actually 9, but why pick nit, that's very close to 1. So we continue to see that as achievable in the moment. Should that let you know in Q2.
Operator: Next, we'll move to Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Phebe, I realize you can't put precision on the tariffs from the step in the land mine here.
Phebe Novakovic: You're right about that.
Myles Walton: I know. I know. So your confidence that you alluded to in the full year outlook. Is that encompassing your assessment of what you're going to see?
Phebe Novakovic: We don't think the defense guys get hit much. There will be some Gulfstream impacts and nothing we see so far is extraordinary but we had a long way to go. And I think a lot of the supply chains have to assimilate these changes and see the impacts to the extent that they have them on them, but that's all I can give you. If I were any more specific, the one thing I could assure you is it would be wrong, and you all would be highly irritated that it gave you a wrong number. So I'm giving you really how we see it from our thought at the moment.
Myles Walton: And then a follow-up, we talked through the call about the administration fingerprints on the Marine business, with the Shipbuilding Act and technologies with some of their initiatives on government services. Is there anything you're seeing as it relates to your combat business and their view on the role of the Army and maybe the X30 and M10 as being prioritized or deprioritized in the framework?
Phebe Novakovic: So one of the things that is a truism about Washington that is now a truism on steroids is that rumor is rampant. So I want to see what the budgets actually show. But the CR did fund Stryker and Abrams at a lesser rate. I think the Army's plan had been on full brigade of Abrams third brigade of Strykers and they cut that request by about a third, so we need to find a little bit more stable funding profile, particularly for the supply chain. That really perturbate the supply chain badly. There is a great interest on the part of the Army, and we are working daily with them to accelerate the next-generation Abrams. So we consider that a very positive step in Army recapitalization and modernization.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Hey good morning everyone.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Noah Poponak: I just wanted to go back to technologies, Jason or Phebe, it's interesting you mentioned engagement with the customer and that this dialogue back and forth dialogue is going on. I wondered how much are they just asking for reductions versus how much are you showing them capability that can help them gain efficiencies while adding revenue to your business. And then additionally, I'm curious how much discussion is there around contract structure and how that could impact margins whether positively or negatively?
Jason Aiken: Yes. Look, in short, I'd say it's all of the above. Not to mince words, they are looking for reductions across the board, and we are actively participating in that and making recommendations to help them solve the problem they're trying to solve. But to your point, there are opportunities down the road because the fact is when you look at the types of efficiencies they're trying to drive the type of headcount reductions they're looking for, it is absolutely the very types of things that we provide in terms of these technology solutions and digitization and so on that enable those types of reductions. So there's going to be a period where it's a shorter-term conversation and then it's going to turn to a longer-term conversation. And to your point about opportunity in that, I think -- look, we talked about fixed price outcome-based type contracts. And again, I mentioned we're comfortable with that. We have a good bit of that in our portfolio and that should bring an opportunity for us. The fact is it's no different than any other contract geometry fixed price versus cost plus. When you take on more risk, there should be an opportunity for a little better margin. But all of it comes at a better price and a better outcome for the customer. I guess if I would add one other thing to watch out from a risk standpoint, we need to be careful from a mission perspective, that if there's dueling priorities of significantly reducing workforce within the government and at the same time, on a meaningful level in sourcing this type of work to the customer that can come at great peril and we need to be mindful of that in these conversations and make sure we don't compromise any mission capability.
Noah Poponak: I appreciate all that detail, Jason. And just one quick one, Kim, what's your updated thinking for full year free cash flow to net income conversion?
Kim Kuryea: I think we're sticking with the forecast that we gave you in January at this point in time. We're obviously always trying to improve upon that. But at this point in the year, we're going to stick to that forecast.
Nicole Shelton: Operator, I think now we have time for just one last question.
Operator: And we'll take that question from Gautam Khanna at TD Cowen.
Gautam Khanna: Yes, thank you guys. Jason, I wanted to just follow up on the prior question. Have you actually seen dose or whatever we want to call this book terminate contracts with GDIT? Has that happened? And if so, can you quantify what that aggregates to?
Jason Aiken: Yes. I'm sure if you look at the public information around DOGE, they list all the contract actually that they've taken action on. And we have been a part of that. There have been some stop work orders, some partial stop work orders and so on. In terms of impact of that, I'm not going to quantify that for the year. As I said, the outlook for the year for the business remains the same. If anything, I think I would remind you that historically, the way General Dynamics puts contract value into backlog is materially different and more conservative than most of GDIT's peers. We're very rigorous about that. And so from a color standpoint, I think I'll put it that way. But we're -- those things are going on, and it's going to be part of the conversation.
Gautam Khanna: Got you. And that's factored in. Okay. And then just a follow-up on Gulfstream, Phebe, could you remind us what percentage of the pipeline of opportunities on the large cabin side are with non-U.S. customers like a rough percentage? Is it half? Is it a quarter?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. No, it's less than half. I think it typically runs 60-40, something like that, 60 U.S.
Nicole Shelton: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the first quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Nicole Shelton: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter 2024 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Phebe.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Thank you Nicole. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning we have reported earnings of $3.35 per diluted share on revenue over 11.67 billion, operating earnings of 1.18 billion and net income of 930 million. Across the company revenue increased 1.1 billion, a strong 10.4% led by a 22% increase from our Aerospace segment and a 20% increase in Marine Systems. We enjoyed revenue increases at three of our four business segments compared to the year ago quarter, only Combat Systems is flat. This is strong growth by any reasonable standard. Importantly operating earnings of 1.18 billion are up 124 million or 11.7%. Similarly, net earnings increased 94 million or 11.2% and earnings per share are up $0.31 or 10.2% over the year ago quarter. When earnings are up at a greater rate than revenue in a growth environment, the business is demonstrating solid operating leverage. We are doing just that. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $34.4 billion is up $3.77 billion or 12.3% over last year. Operating earnings of $3.37 billion are up 14.1%. Net earnings of $2.63 billion are up 14% despite a higher tax rate. Nevertheless, we mistreat EPS consensus by a fair amount because we were able to deliver only four G700s in the quarter. So without further ado, let me move right into aerospace and give you as much insight into this issue as I can, and its implications for the remainder of the year. At the outset, let me give you some comparative numbers that are quite good despite the shortfall of anticipated G700 delivery. Then I will put all of this in some reasonable context for you. Aerospace had revenue of $2.48 billion and operating earnings of $305 million with a 12.3% operating margin. Revenue is $450 million more than last year's third quarter, a solid 22% increase. The revenue increase was driven by the four G700 deliveries, higher service center and special missions volume, and higher FBO and MRO volume, particularly in the Asia Pacific region at Jet Aviation. We delivered 28 aircrafts, including four G700s this quarter. This is 11 fewer G700s than we expected to deliver. We also delivered one less G600, G500 and G280 than we did a year ago quarter. The deliveries of these aircraft are at a reasonably steady state and the modest shortfall is a typical variance, having to do largely with timing and customer convenience. Operating earnings of $305 million are up $37 million or 13.8% over the year ago quarter. The 12.3% operating margin was 90 basis points lower than the year ago quarter for a host of reasons, including inefficiencies caused by supply chain deficiencies. So despite a very good quarter, we had planned to do better and sell side consensus reflected our expectations. You might recall that I told you we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year and that the deliveries would be more or less evenly divided over the last three quarters of the year. While we planned 15 for Q2 and delivered 11, we planned 15 to 16 for Q3 and delivered four. Three weeks before the end of the quarter, we still had a reasonable belief that we would deliver at least 11 in the quarter. So what happened? Whenever we miss our forecast so badly, it is almost always for a number of reasons that all play a part, so let me identify the most important and impactful ones. First, due to the timing of engine certification, aircraft engines arrived late to schedule. We painted the aircraft before the engines arrived and then painted and installed the engines. This led to a significant amount of repaint that resulted in increased cost and time spent. Second, many of the aircraft planned for delivery in this quarter have highly customized interiors. First of tight intricacies. These intricacies are considered to be major changes for regulatory purposes. This resulted in longer-than-anticipated efforts to finalize and achieve supplemental-type certificates. Related to this, the size and complexity of the G700 cabins has also elongated the customer reviews during final delivery of these planes. Third and maybe most important, late in the quarter, a supplier quality escape on a specific component caused the exchange of several components on each planned aircraft delivery up to 16 per aircraft. The supplier is fully cooperative and is providing components for all our needs, but this rework has increased the number of test flights necessary to obtain the final certificate of airworthiness for each aircraft. So the removal and replacement of these components has impacted labor costs and schedule adversely. We are nonetheless working our way nicely through this problem with the cooperation of the vendor. Finally, if that wasn't enough, we lost four days of productivity as a result of Hurricane Helene. Several customers who were in Savannah working with us to accept delivery left and went home to avoid the storm. So given that there is always risk and precise estimates, I will describe our delivery cadence a bit later and provide some monthly forecast so that you can monitor the quarter from publicly available data. Alright, back to some good numerical comparisons. For the year-to-date, aerospace revenue is up $1.63 billion, an increase of 27.7%. Operating earnings were up $146 million, an increase of almost 20%. I recite these figures, which will reflect even more growth by the end of the year so that we do not get lost in the third quarter delivery issue. This is still eye-watering growth. So what impact should we now expect for the fourth quarter and the year given the fewer-than-planned G700 deliveries in the second quarter and third quarters. You may recall that we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year, we now expect to deliver around 42 for the year with 27 in the fourth quarter. This number is not without risk, but there's also some opportunity to bring planes forward. The real issue here is supply chain support during this critical period. Let me give you some insight into the sequencing of the 27 planned deliveries in the quarter. We anticipate five in October, nine in November and 13 in December, recognizing there is some risk as these numbers could vary a little bit up or down through the quarter. You can, as I have said, follow this with fairly accurate but not perfect publicly available data. Turning to market demand, the interest level of buyers and the expiration of accelerated depreciation at year's end suggests a reasonably strong order intake in the fourth quarter, and that is what we are seeing. After some slowing in the U.S. during the second and third quarters, we are seeing improved interest across all models in the fourth quarter. Europe and Middle East activity is quite strong, but current activity in Southeast Asia and China has slowed. Interestingly, the overall number of prospects in all areas continues to increase. The overall number of prospects in our pipeline is at an all-time high, with the most active models being the G500, G600 and G700. We have a good cross-section of U.S. businesses in this mix. In summary, the Aerospace team had a very good quarter, albeit disappointing from the perspective of G700 deliveries. We look forward to a strong finish to the year in the fourth quarter but will fall somewhat short of our midyear forecast. So let's move on to the defense businesses. As a collective, we once again saw strong growth and good operating performance across the portfolio. I may walk you through each segment in turn. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems had revenue of $2.2 billion for the quarter, similar to a year ago. Earnings of $325 million are up 8.3% and margins at 14.7% represents a 120 basis point increase over Q3 last year. Each of the businesses increased earnings with particularly strong operating leverage in munitions and customer service businesses. On a sequential basis, while revenue decreased 3%, earnings rose almost 4%. Year-to-date, revenue of $6.6 billion is up almost 12% and earnings of $920 million are up $124 million or almost 16%. Combat saw robust order activity over $3.3 billion awarded in Q3, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5:1 for the quarter. Orders came from across the portfolio with notable orders in munitions and near defense vehicles for the U.S. Army. Overall, demand remains solid across Combat, particularly in our ordinance and international combat vehicle businesses. In the U.S., we are increasing production of 155-millimeter ammunition projectiles as well as expanding our support to the U.S. Army across several other areas, including final loading and assembly of artillery. Our Combat Systems backlog at roughly $18 billion reflects the strong demand. All in all, a strong performance quarter for Combat. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating strong revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.6 billion is up $597 million, 20% against the year ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume as well as Virginia-class volume drove the growth. DDG-51 revenue also increased somewhat. Just to put this in some context, this 20% growth follows 15% growth in Q4 2023, 11% growth in Q1 of 2024, and 13% growth in Q2 of 2024, impressive growth by any standard. Operating earnings are $258 million, up $47 million over the year ago quarter, with a 20 basis point increase in operating margin. However, margins continue to be adversely affected by additional delays from the submarine industrial base, partially offset by improved margin performance at NASCO. Sequentially, revenue increased 4.2% and earnings improved 5.3% in Q3 driven by volume at EB. Year-to-date, marine revenue of $10.4 billion is up 14.7% and earnings of $735 million are up 12%. So across the business, we have seen rapid growth of revenue and earnings but stagnant margin performance. As I noted last quarter, although the supply chain is improving in places, EB continues to be severely impacted by late deliveries from major component suppliers, which has delayed schedule and is continuing to impact cost. Our out-of-sequence work on modules weighing thousands of tons is time-consuming and therefore, expensive, sometimes up to eight times the cost of in-sequence work. The operating metrics tell us that we have, in fact, increased our productivity to somewhat offset cost. As I noted last quarter, throughput, a significant measure of productivity continues to improve. And while we will continue to work on improved productivity, there is no point hurting portions of the boat only to have to stop and wait increasingly extended periods of time for major components to arrive. It is not good for the bulk over time nor cost. Given the recent projections from the supply chain on deliveries, we need to get our cadence in sync with the supply chain and take costs out of the business if we are to hope to see incremental margin growth. Put another way, the supply chain is not getting better at a fast enough rate as we had hoped. Through our internal efficiency, we have now outpaced them. This is the reality of the post COVID environment for many of our most important suppliers. Finally, to be clear, current submarine delivery projections are not incrementally impacted since they already reflect the anticipated delays from the supply chain. We will, of course, carefully monitor supply chain performance and accelerate our work should their deliveries to us improve. And lastly, technologies. It was another strong quarter with revenue of almost $3.4 billion, which is up 2% over the prior year. Operating earnings in the quarter were $326 million, up 3.5% on a margin of 9.7%. That is a 20 basis point improvement year-over-year. The year-to-date comparisons are similar. Revenue at $9.9 billion is up 1.2%, but earnings of $941 million are up almost 5% on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. The growth for this quarter and the first nine months was driven by GDIT's investments in their digital accelerators. Mission Systems was flat year-over-year as they continue to transition from legacy programs to new franchises. Strong operating performance across the group more than offset the relative growth in services of GDIT compared to hardware at Mission Systems. Sequentially, the group grew 2.5%, spread relatively evenly over both businesses with margins steady at 9.7%. Order activity was particularly strong in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1, that resulted in backlog at the end of the quarter of $14.4 billion, up 13.5% from the year ago quarter. Through the first nine months, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1 more than keeping pace with the strong revenue growth across the business. GDIT and Mission Systems have shared in the robust order activity so far this year, demonstrating the strength of this portfolio and prospects remain strong with a large qualified funnel of more than $120 billion in opportunities they are pursuing across the group. That concludes my comments about the defense businesses. Let me now turn the call over to our CFO, Kim Kuryea, and then we'll wrap up with our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Kimberly A. Kuryea: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 for the company. This is particularly impressive with the continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. Combat Systems and Technologies led the way with book-to-bill of 1.5 times and 1.3 times, respectively. This order activity led to our backlog increasing to $92.6 billion at the end of the quarter. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at a record level of $137.6 billion. Moving to our cash performance, this was another good story in the quarter. Cash flow improved as anticipated over the prior two quarters. We produced $1.4 billion of operating cash flow. All segments contributed to the results with particularly strong cash generation in technologies. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the quarter, or 131% of net income. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting free cash flow to again be greater than 100% of net income, but we now expect the full year to fall short of our 100% conversion target as G700 deliveries pushed into 2025. As a reminder, total free cash flow generation between 2021 and 2023 was quite strong with a three-year conversion rate of 107%. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures were $201 million in the quarter or 1.7% of sales. We're still targeting to be around 2% of sales for the full year given the commitments that remain. We paid $390 million in dividends and repurchased a little over 150,000 shares of stock for $44 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $2.1 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $7.2 billion, down over $700 million from last quarter. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million of fixed rate notes maturing in the fourth quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Net interest expense in the quarter was $82 million, bringing interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $248 million, down from $265 million for the same period in 2023. Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 16.5%, bringing the rate for the first nine months to 17%. The rate was slightly lower than expected, principally due to increased U.S. and foreign tax credits and benefits and other timing items. As a result, for the year, we believe our full year tax rate will be closer to 17%. Now let me turn it back over to Phebe for some final remarks.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Thanks, Kim. In light of the things I have just discussed, let me give you some clarity for the remainder of the year. The figures I am about to give you are all compared to our July update, which will be posted along with today's guidance on our website. In Aerospace, we expect sales to be about $12.3 billion with a 13.2% margin. We are expecting 150 versus 160 deliveries with 10 of the deliveries slipping into next year. This will, of course, benefit next year. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat Systems and Technology remain unchanged from July. Marine Systems revenue should be about $13.9 billion with margins of 6.9% for all the reasons I've previously noted. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue of around $48 billion and margins of around 10.3%. All up, that indicates EPS guidance of approximately $14 per share, about $0.45 below our previous expectations. That concludes my remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions.
Nicole Shelton: Thank you, Phebe. As a reminder we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Seth Seifman at J.P. Morgan.
Seth Seifman: Hey, hi, thanks and good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning Seth.
Seth Seifman: Phebe, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about this year is kind of an unusual year in terms of the various things that have come up with the G700. But as we think about going forward and where the profitability can go in the Aerospace segment, I know it's early for 2025, but maybe even qualitatively talking about the things that are weighing down margin this year and how things can evolve taking into account also the introduction of the G800 and kind of what the progression looks like?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So I think as we've discussed through most of this year, we still have supply chain challenges that require -- at Gulfstream that require out of station work, and we still have late deliveries of material. The supply chain has gotten much better as evidenced by our ability to ramp up production, but they still got ways to go. And until we get that supply chain quality as well as delivery timing stabilized, we'll continue to have out of station work. That, however, should be behind us before too terribly long let's talk about the 700. So the 700 we've talked throughout the year about some of the margin pressures of the first lot, but when we look forward, as we've talked about before, we see gross margin improvement of about 600 to 700 basis points, that remains the same. As I look forward in the Aerospace Group, we see very, very strong margins going forward and we'll see good margins in Q4, not as high as we expected because a lot of 700s was into next year, but we'll have very nice margin expansion as we go through into next year. With respect to the 800, we expect it to come out of the blocks pretty good and have some nice margin impacts over the course of its year. So I would say that we're pretty optimistic over -- starting about next year and into the future of the margin performance at Aerospace.
Seth Seifman: Okay, thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on Combat, with the -- understand the growth trajectory kind of slowing down here in the second half, how much of that reflects kind of the end of the facilitization process for the 155-millimeter shells and how do we think about kind of the interplay of growth and margin going forward, it would seem that the backlog here would allow this to be, as we look across the industry, maybe one of the faster growing businesses across the industry, is that a fair assessment? And then have we -- has this quarter indicated that some of the margin pressure from facilitization is behind us?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So look, if we look at our backlog and the threat environment and the performance at Combat in general, over time, I think we expected in our market space we will continue to grow and perform very well. Facilitization for increased munition production is largely behind us. We're moving into production. We'll see increased revenue from our combat vehicle business and so we do see a pretty good solid growth pattern as we go forward. This year, we accelerated growth into the first half so we expect fourth quarter to be relatively flat but still have about 5.9% growth for the group in the year. And we expect to see very nice growth going forward. I would add this, in a high-performing organization like Combat Systems, variability in revenue and margin is almost always a question of timing, so just to give you a little context on that score.
Operator: We'll move next to Robert Stallard at Vertical Research Partners.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much, good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: First of all, a question on Marine, Phebe, you mentioned about the supply chain issues there. I was wondering if you could elaborate on why it's not improved as much as you would have hoped and also at what point does this start to negatively impact submarine schedules?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think that it already has impacted schedule and that's been pretty well publicized by the Navy. Until recently, we had a reasonable hope, and it was a reasonable set of expectations based on the indicators that the supply chain would continue to get better. But most recently, we've seen that, in fact, that's not the case. And they're not getting better at the rate at which we had hoped for a whole series of reasons. And I think that and some of those have been very well documented, the Navy and Congress have been well aware of that. So they've been pumping additional support into the parts of the supply chain and some parts are doing well, but others are continuing to struggle. And I'd say that it was not a typical number of manufacturing sectors. If you go back from December of 2019, the PPI for manufacturing has increased by 25%. Overlay that with the demographic challenges that we've had with the smaller cohort of new hires and wage growth that span and added pressure on some of our suppliers at the same time, almost quintupling the throughput on -- and the demand on submarines. So there's been a lot of pressure, parts of the supply chain. I think that's well understood by our customer and the Congress. So we're going to continue to work with them and help where we can. But in the meantime, we're going to control what we can control. And that is we're going to adjust our pace to align with what we now see as more predictable supply chain schedules that have elongated. It will take cost out of our business, and we'll continue to work productivity on the debt plates [ph] with an increasingly capable and skilled and experienced workforce. So you can control what you can control, and we're simply in the moment adjusting to what we see as the inability of the supply chain to improve at the rate that we had hoped and that frankly I believe our customer had hoped.
Robert Stallard: Yes. And just as a quick follow-up, do you think the supply chain issues jeopardize the aspiration to move back to two boats a year on the Virginia-class?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think that in the short term, there's going to be pressure on that, considerable pressure on that. So I think that's something for us to work through with our customer and, frankly, the customer to work with the supply chain. I think it's a well-known issue.
Operator: We'll go next to Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning. Phebe, if I could follow up on Rob's question there. The implied fourth quarter margin at mid-6% range for Marine, is there something in the third quarter positively offsetting to get to the low 7s, I don't know if there's a positive EAC you might have taken? And then looking to 2025, is the mid-6% margin, the right run rate that you're looking for now in that business?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So this quarter, we had some strong performance out of NASCO. We had some good performance at Electric Boat. But that's going to, in this environment, vary quarter-by-quarter. So we anticipate some more supply chain impacts in the fourth quarter. And as we project next year, and I'll give you that clarity about in our regular order in January but as we project next year, the ability to continue to drive incremental margins in the short-term is just how fast we can take our pace down at cost and improve our productivity. So we'll work through all that with the shipyard and give you a sense of what we're seeing in margins. I'd say they are going to be kind of lumpy probably through next year and maybe even beyond.
Myles Walton: Okay. And then one clarification. I know it's super granular and near term, so I apologize in advance. But in October to date, have you gotten more than one G7 out the door?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, I think I was -- yes, we have. And I think I've given you some pretty good clarity of what we expect for October. That's pretty much on schedule. And then November and December, I gave you that clarity as well. I'm trying to be as transparent with you all so that you can better understand where we anticipate and as you well know, you can follow some of that with publicly available data, which is directionally correct.
Operator: We'll go next to David Strauss at Barclays.
David Strauss: Thanks, good morning. Phebe, following up on the items that you highlight in terms of what's impacting the G700 delivery. I guess just to clarify, is roles from an engine perspective, are they behind, is that part of the issue? And then on the interior side, do you view this as kind of a temporary issue or could it linger just given a much larger cabin here, and I would assume a lot more in the way of complexity on the interior side on a go-forward basis?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So we control the interiors. So we're very comfortable in our projections on how we work those interiors. So I don't -- I'm not worried or even concerned about our interiors. Engines on stations have improved, so that is definitely a benefit. And I tried to give you some color around that particular issue in my remarks, but there's improvement.
David Strauss: Okay. And a quick follow-up. The [indiscernible] announcement with partnership with Lockheed in the quarter. Can you just give some color around that and how that might materialize over the next couple of years in terms of numbers? Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So we'll make some investment over the next couple of years. And then I think that -- and I don't have an exact start date off the tip of my tongue. But a lot of the number of motors will be driven by -- overall by the demand for the rock that itself, but we're pretty comfortable that this is well within our capability set, and we'll work through that with our partner.
David Strauss: Thanks very much.
Operator: We'll move next to Peter Arment at Baird.
Peter Arment: Hey good morning Phebe. Phebe, maybe just to focus on Combat, you guys have had really strong growth through the first three quarters of the year, and you're obviously -- your profit margins reflect a lot of really good execution. Just how are you thinking about just kind of the long-term visibility here, how big of a business do you see in terms of the bookings environment, you mentioned Middle East and Europe, maybe just describe, I think, how you're seeing the visibility on Combat?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So our book-to-bill and backlog supports nice growth. The unfortunate threat environment also continues to drive demand. And we see our pipeline is pretty robust, but domestically and outside the United States. So at least for the foreseeable future, we see nice steady growth in Combat. [Multiple Speakers] with good margin performance.
Peter Arment: Yes. Then my follow-up is on the margin front, I mean almost 14% for the first nine months. I mean, is there opportunities to further enhance margins, I know there are some limits here and mix is a factor, but you've got a lot of growth and a lot of us are just focused on kind of what actually this business can generate?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So historically, this -- when we've talked about this before in previous calls over the years, this tends to be a 14.5% margin business given some margin variability quarter-to-quarter, again, largely driven by mix. And I suspect that will continue in that range. Again, some margins will be better. Could we make long-term incremental structural improvement in that. I don't see that at the moment, but there's always opportunity. So we'll continue to pursue this. As I said, this is a -- this has always been a very high operating leverage company. So -- and groups of company, the three of them. So I think we'll continue to see both nice growth and good earnings expansion.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ron Epstein at Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein: Good morning. So maybe back to the supply chain. If we look at the supply chain for the shipyards, I mean, we all kind of know that's been an issue. And if we look at the land systems business, I mean it's growing. Do you worry about the supply chain there and I guess, broadly, what has the supply chain in your munitions business and the businesses that are growing in land systems doing better than the supply chain in the shipyards?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So I think it's a function of the type of material that we use in Combat Systems versus the scope, size of the material and inputs we use both at Marine Group and particularly submarine and Gulfstream. I mean, Gulfstream supply chain got perturbated by a lot of factors that have been well reported. But I think it's really a question of just the types of materials we use and the overall demand even outside of the Combat particularly vehicle business that tends to be a more robust supply chain on component parts given that there's other uses for a lot of that material. Materials, the inputs for Aerospace and for Gulfstream and the Marine Group are one of a kind. They don't replicate anywhere else in industry. So I think that, that explains why we've had fewer issues. I mean we had some issues with supply at Combat, but those are largely behind us. And I think that I tried to give you some color on what that is.
Ronald Epstein: Yes. And then maybe as a follow-on, back to Marine, sorry, I know it's what everybody is focusing on at the moment. When we look at Marine, you say supply chain, supply chain is a huge thing, right? And I think we all have a good understanding in Aero where the type points are. And what in Marine is the issue, I mean, what kind of component -- if you just kind of broadly want to understand if we peel back the onion, where are the suppliers not supplying, is it bearing -- what is it?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, we have a number of smaller parts that remain -- they get produced by single-source suppliers and often small ones, that remain a bit of -- remain an issue. I think it's a large component parts that -- and I think the navy has reported on some of that, that tend to be highly complex. Costs have risen significantly, and you've got green workforce in a lot of these areas. So those are -- it's a large group. I think that's all I'm about the most color I'm going to give you on where some of the challenges are because the navy has been kind of explicit in some instances about that. And I think that's just a better place to be.
Operator: We'll go next to Ken Herbert at RBC Capital Markets.
Kenneth Herbert: Yeah, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first, Phebe, on services within Aerospace, you had nice growth here again. You've sort of reset, it looks like at a sort of a much higher level. I know you've added capacity. Is this a good run rate to think about for the services business within this and maybe if you could talk about how dilutive this part of the business is relative to the aircraft side within this segment?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So we have long said that services is going to grow at the rate of the fleet expansion. And think about it this way, we gather -- we garner between 85% and 90% plus of all Gulfstream service. And so as the fleet expands, service expands. Its impact on overall margins tends to be rather lumpy, but it is in some instances in some quarters, it's about even, so it's certainly not any large dilution impact and hasn't been for some time. So this is a nice, steady growth business.
Kenneth Herbert: Okay. And on the quality escape, I guess, with how deliveries are trending in this month and your confidence, you feel good about that risk getting retired or is there anything -- it sounds like there is clearly still some caution into the back half of the year, but do you feel good about that particular supplier and getting back on schedule?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. They're working very cooperatively with us, but I think it's emblematic or at least descriptive of the fact that we don't have all of these risks behind us and that we're slipping airplanes into next year. So I've tried to give you my best estimate both on cadence and timing and of what we see, but for the remainder of this year and then as I said, some of these airplanes will go into next year. But we've worked well with the supplier, understand the scope. So that is not any particularly long-term issue, nor is it a complete anomaly just in terms of the type of thing that happened here. So we're just fixing that in the regular order. It was a timing problem, but not a systemic one, think about it that way.
Kenneth Herbert: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Doug Harned at Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: Good morning, thank you. Going back to Marine and Electric Boat. When you look at the supply chain issues there and the delays in the programs, how do you think of the Virginia-class and Columbia-class in a sense separately, how do you prioritize work or are you making decisions to prioritize one over the other?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, that is a national security decision dictated by the Navy. So Columbia has across the entirety of the industrial base priority, and it has since its inception. So yes, so by definition, Virginia gets behind in terms of priority Columbia. And that has ramifications for Virginia. It's well understood by our customer, particularly in an environment in which supply chain material is constrained. Columbia gets the first of the pick, again, given its national security imperative.
Douglas Harned: Well, given the importance of these programs, not just to Navy, but the overall Defense, you have got money in the supplemental for supporting the shipbuilding industrial base. But when you work with your customer, how is that helping and are there subsequent steps that can be taken within the budget to help build this industrial base better?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So the Navy and the Congress have recognized that there are portions of the industrial base that need help. And that's what the shipbuilding and submarine industrial-based funding is attended to address both expanding the capacity and shoring up the capacity. There has been significant cost growth, as I noted earlier, across manufacturing business in particular and by extension into the submarine industrial base. So costs are increasing. Back to life cost or economic realities. And the funding is going to have to adjust to these fundamental changes in inputs and that will need to happen over time.
Douglas Harned: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to Gautam Khanna at TD Cowen.
Gautam Khanna: Yeah, thank you. Good morning. So just to follow up on Marine. I know that you guys are in negotiations with the Navy on the Columbia-class, five of those, and I think it's 10 or 12 Virginia-class boat. I was curious what sort of your expectation is for the timing of when those contracts get agreed to and is there any cash or margin implications once those are signed to what's in the yard now and just if you could talk about that?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So cash, no. Margin impact happens over time as we begin to execute those programs. I don't have a good sense of timing. I expect that the FY 2024 ships that are not yet under contract maybe in the next few months. But I don't have a good sense of timing for the remainder of the negotiations on Block 6, the contract on Block 6 or Built 2 of Columbia. It's going to be hard to get those contracts under -- the ships under contract, given that we've had the kind of cost increases in inputs, frankly, throughout the economy. But as I noted earlier, manufacturing PPI high, and those costs have increased for inputs. So we're going to have to work that with our customer and Congress.
Gautam Khanna: Just as a follow-up, I guess what I'm asking is, do you -- is there any expectation that there would be relief provided for higher labor inflation you've -- that everyone's experienced on boats that are already in production as perhaps part of that negotiation?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I don't know if part of that negotiation, I wouldn't link it necessarily to those negotiations, but we are constantly in negotiation with our customer on a whole -- on any number of contracting actions and now is no different. We also have entitlements in our contracts for which we will seek remedy. So there's a lot of ongoing discussions with our customer about these costs these fact-of-life cost increases and labor cost increases. And that plus the remedy to which we're entitled. We're going to continue to work both of those issues with our customers.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gavin Parsons at UBS.
Gavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning. Phebe, you of course have delivered some G700s out of inventory this year and maybe some out of inventory again next year. Can you help us with what the underline…?
Phebe N. Novakovic: We are out of inventory. Help me with what you mean by out of inventory. I mean, we don't have 700 in inventory. And 700 that are in some stage of production, but just picking a nit there with you.
Ronald Epstein: Yes, fair. I guess can you help us with the underlying production rate?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So I try to be as explicit as I could be for the remainder of the year. Some of these airplanes will go into next year, that will help next year. And then we'll give you a lot of clarity around what next year looks like in our ordinary course when we give you our guidance in January. The airplane is performing very well. But we still, as I've noted, frequently, we still got out of station work, that needs to get behind us.
Ronald Epstein: Okay. And I'll try one more. I don't know if this is just an accounting question, but you called out all the elevated cost on paint interiors component replacement on G700. How does the 600 to 700 basis point margin step-up remain intact?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, that will happen. I don't have exact clarity on when those gross margin improvements will happen, but I think relatively soon and over the course of potentially the next year, we have to see some really nice margin expansion. We're seeing it in the fourth quarter right off the bat. And I expect to see that margin expansion continue throughout next year and beyond.
Operator: We'll go next to Jason Gursky at Citi.
Jason Gursky: Hello there, good morning everybody. I was wondering if you could just step back for minute and maybe talk a little bit about the things that you're most excited about and where you are kind of spending the most amount of your time as it relates to technology investments and the business development pipeline across...?
Phebe N. Novakovic: In technology?
Jason Gursky: In -- across the defense business as a whole.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So I would say that we need to continue to capitalize on the very strong growth profile we see going forward in the Marine Group. We spend an awful lot of time on improving our own capability within our own shipyards. I think the technologies group, in general, has shown nice growth and they have positioned themselves in faster currents within their highly competitive businesses. So we're pretty excited about what we see there. And then I think Combat Systems performance continues to be strong and how we then translate demand into revenue in the out years and continue the strong operating performance we've had there is sort of where we focus our time. There's a lot to be excited about in terms of performance of the company.
Jason Gursky: Yes, understood. Okay. It's helpful to understand the prioritization. And then maybe this is a question where we get Kim involved as well, but just kind of philosophically how you guys are -- how you all, excuse me, are approaching the balance sheet and the capital structure and leverage. I'm just kind of -- as we think about the future of the company, where you want to operate?
Kimberly A. Kuryea: Yes. Well, Obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet. We were recently upgraded in terms of our credit rating, and we have some debt repayments coming due that we expect to pay on schedule, and we'll consistently look at where we stand, but we feel pretty good about where we stand right now.
Jason Gursky: Right. And just philosophically, you want to keep your leverage under externs of leverage. I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. I don't think at this point in time, I think we're continuing to work the growth environment that we're in and determining in terms of where the cash is going to come out for 2025, especially. And I think it's a matter of time in terms of taking a look at where we stand. So Audrey, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take that question from Scott Deuschle at Deutsche Bank.
Scott Deuschle: Hey, good morning. Phebe, just to clarify your response to David's question earlier, do the certifications you're getting this year on those highly customized interiors for G700, do those derisk this as an item from being a constraint next year?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. I mean these are the first ones out of the block. So we don't see that as a constraining item next year. Does that answer the question?
Scott Deuschle: Yes, does Combat Systems have many products that are approved for export on a direct commercial sale basis and then are you seeing much traction for DCS sales, either in terms of the bookings you put up recently at Combat or in terms of orders that are in the pipeline?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Not out of the United States, but out of our European businesses, yes, those tend to be direct sales, and that's been true for 25 years. And the demand for those products in Europe, in Eastern and Western Europe remains very, very strong.
Scott Deuschle: Thank you.
Nicole Shelton: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Nicole Shelton: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2024 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.26 per diluted share on revenue of $11.98 billion, operating earnings of $1.16 billion and net income of $905 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our four business segments compared to the year ago quarter. Across the company, revenue increased a strong 18%, with a 51% increase in our Aerospace segment and a 10% increase across our defense units, strong growth by any standard. Importantly, operating earnings of $1.16 billion are up almost $200 million or 20.2%, demonstrating solid operating leverage. Similarly, net earnings are up 21.6% and earnings per share up 21% over the year ago quarter. You will note, we missed Street EPS consensus by $0.02 due entirely to the slip of 4 G700 deliveries from the last week in the quarter to the beginning Q3. One has since been delivered, three are imminent. From a different perspective, the sequential comparisons are also quite favorable. Revenue was up $1.2 billion and operating earnings are up $120 million on steady margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $22.7 billion is up $2.67 billion or 13.3% over last year's first half. Operating earnings of nearly $2.2 billion are up 15.4%. Net earnings of $1.7 billion are up 15.6% despite a higher provision for income taxes. In a few minutes, our CFO, Kim Kuryea, will provide you with free cash flow for the first half and remainder of the year, our strong continued order activity and backlog, as well as some additional relevant financial information. But first, I will take you through each of the segments. We'll start with Aerospace. Let me give you some comparative numbers that will show the front end of a tremendous growth surge for Aerospace that will progress favorably throughout the year. Then I will attempt to put all of this in some reasonable perspective for you. Aerospace had revenue of $2.94 billion and operating earnings of $319 million with a 10.9% operating margin. Revenue is $987 million more than last year's second quarter, a remarkable 51% increase. The revenue increase was driven by additional new aircraft deliveries, coupled with higher service revenue. We delivered 37 aircraft, including 11 newly certified G700s in the quarter. This is four fewer than we expected to deliver, but more about that in a minute. Operating earnings of $319 million are up $83 million, 35% over the year ago quarter. The 10.9% operating margin was 120 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was driven by G700 deliveries that carried more than expected costs from three things: First, retrofit; second, out-of-station work related to the late arrival of parts; and three, the extended certification period. This cost burden will affect 20 lot one aircraft, which includes five test aircraft that will not deliver this year. So we are through the lot one cost burden for this year within the next four deliveries. The good news is that margins on the G700 are expected to increase by 600 to 700 basis points in lot two and by a similar increment in lot three. By the time we reach lot three production and deliveries, we will have reached a steady state in terms of productivity and predictability. A few comments on predictability. You might recall that I told you we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year and that the deliveries would be more or less evenly divided over the last three quarters of the year. But we planned 15 for Q2 and deliver 11. So much for predictability. We actually had the remaining four completed and ready to go, but could not get through the preflight delivery testing in time. You might be surprised to learn that each G700 has flown about 30 hours of tests before delivery. Two of the planes also needed a supplemental type certificate because of a very different cabin configuration. That wasn't done by the end of the quarter. All right, back to some numerical comparisons. The sequential numbers are equally impressive. Revenue is up $856 million, a strong 41% increase, and operating earnings are up $64 million, about 25%, affected by 130 basis point degradation in operating margins for the reason I just mentioned a moment ago. You will see much stronger operating margins in the third quarter, followed by even better operating margin and related earnings in the fourth quarter. Separately, we still expect to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year. Look for about 16 in the third quarter and 23 to 25 in the fourth quarter. From an orders perspective, we had a respectable quarter at 0.9:1 book-to-bill in dollar terms. There is strong interest in a fair pipeline across the product mix. As I noted last quarter, bringing transactions to close has elongated somewhat, as there is some caution, while customers digest the impact of geopolitical events in general and U.S. presidential election in particular. The United States remains our strongest market, but the yield is improving. The Middle East shows very strong potential. And just very recently, we have seen some improvement in China. The interest level of buyers and the expiration of accelerated depreciation at the end of the year suggests a reasonably strong order intake in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. We are pleased to have both G700 FAA and EASA certifications behind us. The Aerospace comparative revenue and earnings numbers in the quarter are very good by any reasonable standard, but still behind consensus, largely attributable to deliveries that did not make it to the wire. In summary, the Aerospace team had a very good quarter. It is handling the rapid increase in deliveries and revenue on a methodical and disciplined fashion. We look forward to a powerful second half with increasing revenue and earnings quarter-over-quarter as we forecasted at the end of last quarter. Moving to the defense business as a collective. We once again saw strong growth and good operating performance across the portfolio. Let me walk you through each segment in turn. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems had revenue of almost $2.3 billion, up 19% over the year ago quarter, with growth at each of the three business units. Earnings of $313 million are up almost 25%, and margins at 13.7% represent a 70 basis point increase over the Q2 last year. In short, very strong operating performance from Combat Systems. The increased revenue came from facilities expansion and artillery work in our ammo business, coupled with increases in international tank and wheeled vehicle sales and U.S. Army programs of record. Each of the businesses increased earnings nicely, with particularly strong operating leverage in our international vehicle business. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 8.8% and earnings rose 11%. Year-to-date, revenue of about $4.4 billion is up 19.3% and earnings of $595 million are up almost $100 million, or 20%. Combat saw robust order intake with over $3.4 billion awarded in Q2, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5:1 for the quarter. Orders came from across the portfolio, ranging from ammunition to main battle tanks for the U.S. Army and wheeled vehicles for an international customers. Demand remained steady, particularly for the Abrams main battle tank and international wheeled vehicles. We expect demand for ammo to continue to rise for some time to come as we rapidly increase production of our artillery shells and components. All in all, a very strong growth and performance quarter for Combat Systems. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating strong revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.45 billion is up $394 million, almost 13% against the year ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth, while Virginia-class and DDG-51 revenue also increased nicely. Operating earnings are $245 million, up $10 million over the year ago quarter with a 60 basis points decrease in operating margin. Margins were impacted by continued delays to EB from the submarine industrial base, partially offset by improvement in DDG-51 performance of Bath and continued steady performance at NASSCO. Sequentially, revenue increased 3.7% and earnings improved 5.6% in Q2, driven by volume at EB, as we saw some quarter-over-quarter improvement in supply chain deliveries to the yard and continued positive performance at NASSCO. Year-to-date, Marine revenue of $6.8 billion is up 12.1% and earnings of $477 million are up 7%. As I noted a moment ago, although the supply chain is improving in places, EB continues to be impacted by late deliveries from the supply chain, which both delay schedule and impacts costs. At a sequence work on multi-ton modules is time-consuming and expensive. Our strategy, as you know, has been to increase our productivity to somewhat offset that impact. To that end, throughput, a significant measure of productivity, continues to improve, hiring is good and attrition is lower, so all good signs. In summary, we are starting to see some momentum build in our shipyards to meet the delivery and repair requirements of our customer, the U.S. Navy. We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow, but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations. Finally, Technologies. The group had another good quarter with revenue of nearly $3.3 billion, up 2.5% over the year ago quarter and operating earnings of $320 million, up 13.1% on a 90 basis point improvement in margin. This nice improvement in operating performance was across both businesses. GDIT margins increased 40 basis points, emission systems margins were up 130 basis points as they continue to recover from supply chain impacts experienced in 2023 and before. Sequentially, revenue was up $81 million or 2.5% and operating earnings are up 8.5% on a 50 basis points improvement in margin. And the story is much the same for the year-to-date with revenue of $6.5 billion, up about 1%, and operating earnings of $615 million, up 5.7% against the first six months of last year. As a result, margins for the group were up 40 basis points year-to-date to 9.4%. So all relevant comparisons this quarter show revenue and earnings growth and a margin expansion of both businesses, positioning them well going forward. In short, GDIT is holding its industry-leading margins, while consistently delivering year-over-year growth, while Mission Systems is delivering nice margin expansion as it transitions from sunsetting legacy programs. The group received $3.3 billion in orders in the quarter, bringing the total of $7.2 billion for the first six months. That results in a book-to-bill for the group of 1.0 for the quarter and 1.1 for the year-to-date. Total awards for the group in the first half were up 30% compared with the first six months of 2023. This is on the strength of win rates consistently around 80% for the group and capture rates at roughly 65%, both very strong for this industry. Backlog was down slightly from the end of the first quarter due to the removal of backlog associated with an international divestiture in the quarter, but was up almost $200 million from a year ago. As importantly, the qualified pipeline remains very robust at over $120 billion. So the group is well positioned to continue its growth trajectory. Let me now turn the call over to Kim.
A - Kimberly Kuryea: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective at $10 billion, with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 0.8:1 for the company. This was achieved in the quarter when revenue grew 18% over last year, and there were no significant shipbuilding contracts awarded. Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 0.9:1, while revenue grew over 40% sequentially with the initial deliveries of the G700. On the defense side of the business, Combat Systems did particularly well with a book-to-bill of 1.5:1, and Technologies was 1:1. We ended the quarter with backlog of $91.3 billion, essentially even with where we were a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at nearly $130 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We generated $814 million of operating cash flow. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $613 million for the quarter, yielding a cash conversion rate of 68%. Technologies led the segments with strong cash flow generation in the quarter. When you consider the free cash flow through the first half of 2024, we are slightly positive at $176 million and about $250 million ahead of what we had planned. After the planned slow start in the first half, we expect significant second half growth. With the majority of the cash generated in the fourth quarter, we are still planning a cash conversion rate around 100% for the year. So you may be wondering what's driving cash to be so backloaded this year. It's apparent from our balance sheet that we have been building up working capital in the first half of the year, which we expect to substantially unwind in the second half. One obvious driver of this is Gulfstream with the ramp-up for the certification and deliveries of the G700. The planned G700 deliveries in the second half are significant, which will reduce working capital. Another large contributor to the growth in working capital has been Combat Systems. They have several programs that pay at delivery. Thus, we are buying material in the first half of the year that results in product deliveries and cash in the second half of the year. Combat is also subject to the timing of deposits on international programs, and the first half of the year has been a period of liquidating deposits received in prior periods. Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $201 million or 1.7% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year and slightly above 2% of sales when the year wraps up. Also in the quarter, we paid $389 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 119,000 shares of stock for $34 million. Through the first half, we repurchased only a modest number of shares for a total of $139 million, driven largely by our 2024 cash profile. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.4 billion and a net debt position of $7.9 billion, down over $300 million from last quarter. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million of fixed rate notes maturing in the fourth quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $84 million compared to $89 million last year. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $166 million, down from $180 million for the same period in 2023 on lower debt balances. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $320 million. Finally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 17%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 17.2%. This rate is a little lower than our outlook for the full-year, which remains around 17.5%. For the second half of the year, we expect the rate to be lower in the third quarter and then a bit higher in the fourth due to typical timing items. Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you.
Phebe Novakovic: All right. Thanks, Kim. Let me move on to give you updated forecast for the year. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which will be posted along with today's guidance on our website. In Aerospace, we are sticking with our same earnings estimate, but we'll get there with higher revenue and about a 100 basis point drop in margins for all the reasons I mentioned to you a few minutes ago. We are still holding to our delivery estimate of about 160 airplanes. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat will have revenue of about $200 million higher than previously projected as a result of continued demand. So look for total revenue of about $8.7 billion. Margin should be about the same. All in, operating earnings will be up $30 million over the previous forecast. Marine Systems revenue should be up $1 billion of Electric Boat and somewhat at Bath. So we will have annual revenue between $13.4 billion and $13.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.4%, with operating earnings up around $45 million over the January forecast. For Technologies, we are not changing our earlier guidance to you. On a company wide basis, we see annual revenue up about $2 billion, with overall margins down about 30 basis points. So total revenue of $47.8 billion to $48.2 billion, and operating earnings up modestly. All up, that indicates EPS guidance of $14.40 to $14.50, $0.05 over prior guidance. I will note that normally, this time of year, we have solid insight into revenue and margin. In this growth environment, the upside has been difficult to predict with equal clarity. Should anything materially change in Q3, I will give you another credit guidance. That concludes my remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions.
Nicole Shelton: Thank you, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to our first question from David Strauss at Barclays.
David Strauss: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Phebe, on the G700, as I understand, there are some issues that you have to fix with these prebuilt airplanes. Can you just talk about what exactly the issue is, how far of the way you are through that? And whether this is still an issue in terms of airplanes that are on the line? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. So very late in the certification process, we had a requirement to bind together some wires in the tail of the airplane. So relatively simple fix. For those airplanes that we had already built, we took the tails off. For those that we were building, we just didn't put them on. So this is largely behind us. And contributed to a bit to the cost impact on lot one. But I would note that it's extremely hard to discern anything meaningful looking from the outside in here. This is, as I said, largely behind us and was pretty late in the process. And not particularly difficult to do.
David Strauss: Great. And so none of the slips relate to kind of supply chain issues? It was more about just fixing the certification issue?
Phebe Novakovic: Right. Think about the supply chain as more a question of cost than delivery.
David Strauss: Terrific. Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to Peter Arment at Baird.
Peter Arment: Thanks. Good morning, Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Peter Arment: Yes, it's really encouraging to hear about the 50 to 52 is still intact for the G700. Maybe you could just touch upon, I think expectations around bookings? I know you've talked about in the past about geopolitics and a lot of just volatility in the world. Just your thoughts on just bookings for the year? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So we tried to give you some color around that. In the remarks, I'd say that we typically see in any U.S. presidential election, a slowdown around the election. And I think this won't be any different. But we do expect, as I noted in my remarks, a more robust fourth quarter because we've got the expiration of the accelerated depreciation. And the pipeline is quite good. And I gave you also some color around the geographical distribution there. So all in all, there's quite a bit of interest in our airplanes.
Peter Arment: That's great to hear. Just as a quick follow-up. Just your latest thoughts on just the G400. Is that still tracking to meet your kind of original plan?
Phebe Novakovic: It is, and we ought to fly very soon.
Operator: We'll go next to Robert Spingarn at Melius Research.
Robert Spingarn: Hey, good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Phebe, maybe sort of a two-parter on Marine. I wanted to ask you, first, with the recent supplemental, there was money, a little over $3 billion to help support the submarine industrial base. And you did mention last time that there were a few sole-source suppliers of complex components that were causing some of the delays. So wondering if that money has gotten to them and is resolving the issue or if you had to qualify alternate sources? And then the longer-term question is, a decade ago or maybe a little bit longer, Marine was a 10% type margin business. And given the supply chain issues, the impact to the shipbuilding workforce in the aftermath of COVID, is that a realistic target at some point in the future? And what might be the timing on that? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. So let me take each part of your question in turn. So the Navy, working quite closely with the Congress, allocated significant funding for the industrial base, as you noted. That money has begun to flow, and it is intended for another, and it's targeted for a number of uses. One, increased throughput; two, some facilitization, some training, increased hiring. And so it's been really critical, and we've been pushing very hard to get that money as fast as we possibly can into the supply chain to help stabilize them. And let me put it to you this way. There are some supply chain providers who are improving and improving quite nicely. We still have some challenges out there that are pretty well publicized, but we're continuing to work with the U.S. Navy on how to the extent that those can be mitigated. So we continue to see cost impacts from late deliveries of out-of-sequence work, as I noted in my remarks. But we continue to be hopeful. We are hopeful that the additional funding that we're putting into the supply chain should help stabilize over time. So with respect to your 10% margin, that certainly is our goal. I think the supply chain has to stabilize. We've got to come down our learning curves on Columbia. Virginia throughput has to increase. So we will ultimately stabilize in the Marine group. And I will notice, by the way, I think you mentioned something about the workforce. We have, in the last year or so had no difficulty in hiring at our shipyards, and our training program has been pretty robust. So we've got shipbuilders coming out of that training program with a higher than typical level of proficiency. Our retention is also much better. So that gives us some confidence in the throughput and productivity capacity of the shipyards. But everything in shipbuilding is slow. So it's small, incremental improvement over time. But I think 10% is a reasonable goal over time, and there's no way to estimate that with any precision. Not going to speculate, but it is objective.
Robert Spingarn: Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Cai von Rumohr at TD Cowen.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much, Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Cai von Rumohr: Good morning. So the tail issue at Gulfstream, does the required rework extend beyond the first 20 units in the first block? And should we be looking for a sequential build in terms of unit deliveries, so that I would assume then you have less first block impact in the third quarter than the second and even less or none in the fourth. And therefore, you should see a strong lift in the margin sequentially. Is that the way to look at it?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So I tried to give you a lot of color on that in my remarks. But with respect to the binding of some of those wires in the tail, that's largely behind us. And with respect to the margin trajectory, we see nice margin improvement in this quarter and then again in the fourth quarter. Think about the fourth quarter as mid- to high-upper teens.
Cai von Rumohr: Okay. And because of this rework, should we assume that the profitability on Block 2 for the G700 that the sequential step-up from 1 to 2 will be somewhat bigger than one might normally look for?
Phebe Novakovic: I tried to give you that in my remarks, but this is really a Lot 1 issue.
Cai von Rumohr: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky at Citi.
Jason Gursky: Hey, good morning everybody. Phebe, I just wanted to spend a few minutes talking about the services business in Aerospace. And just some of the trends that you're seeing there with the fleet utilization and what you're seeing in the competitive environment in that business as well?
Phebe Novakovic: So on the service side, services, as we said before, will grow with the expansion of the fleet. Our objective is to get as much of the Gulfstream worked as possible, and we've got the vast preponderance of that already. Services is growing this year. As is, by the way, special mission, which is driving a lot of the revenue increase this year, but we should see nice steady growth over time in the service sector. And there's no real -- with respect to services, there's no real difference in any of the competitive environment.
Jason Gursky: Okay. Great. And then turning to Technologies and maybe using a bit of your crystal ball on the pipeline and the outlook for bookings and book-to-bill there. What's the environment look like there for you all over the next, I don't know, 12, 18 months on the pipeline and the outlook for book-to-bill for the Technologies business?
Phebe Novakovic: So we continue to see a very active pipeline. I think the available market at the moment is over $120 billion, it's pretty robust. And we've been winning our fair share and a little bit more than our fair share. So we believe that over time, that will continue as it has in the last couple of years drive services growth and frankly, at Mission Systems as well. So I think technology is positioned for a nice steady slow growth, which is exactly what we have promised in the past and what we're delivering. So pretty steady.
Operator: We'll go next to George Shapiro at Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, George.
George Shapiro: Phebe, I just wanted some clarification. You had said that the pretty much all the costs were, incorporated yet you delivered 11, five you said won't be delivered until next year, but there's still four left. Is that the four that you just delivered in the first week or so of the second -- of the third quarter?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So the Lot 1 consisted of about 20 or so airplanes. All five are test airplanes, they'll deliver next year. But this year, the Lot 1 costs are going to be behind us imminently. We've delivered one of the four. And I tried to give you some color on the delivery process. And the other three imminent here. So I think we're in pretty good shape on that. Does that help you?
George Shapiro: Yes, that helps. And then just a quick follow-up on the usual question. If I look at the gross bookings versus the net bookings from your backlog, it's like a $171 million difference. Was that just forfeiture cancellation, currency-related? Do you have any comments on that?
Phebe Novakovic: Nothing that I can put my finger on, to be quite honest, in the moment.
George Shapiro: Okay. And one last one and aftermarket growth in the quarter at Gulfstream?
Phebe Novakovic: Pretty good for us. The service business, and we expect it to continue to grow this year, which is driving a lot of the revenue increase, along with special mission.
Operator: We'll go next to Ken Herbert at RBC.
Kenneth Herbert: Yes, hi, Phebe. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Kenneth Herbert: I wanted to see if you could make some comments on Combat. And specifically, the outlook for bookings in Europe and other regions. But also, how should we think about with the orders you're booking today, the impact on the backlog and to what extent are they accretive to segment margins? Or how accretive could they be as some of the more recent bookings flow into the backlog of revenues?
Phebe Novakovic: So the bookings continue to reflect the threat environment. Both that they were driven in the quarter, both by international vehicle orders and U.S. ammunition and Army programs of record. And I think we'll see as we're going forward, I'd say that Combat Systems is typically, as we talked about in the past, probably a mid-14% margin business, but it will have quarter variability, sometimes up around 15%. So it's really a question of mix. In the moment, we see increased what we call sustainment, think about repair and support, which tends to carry a little higher margin. And you didn't exactly ask this question, but I'll sort of answer it. As we move from the lower margin facilitization work to the higher-margin throughput on -- that's generated like the throughput on ammunition, you'll see a little bit of margin expansion there.
Kenneth Herbert: And just can you quantify the cash impact in the second half and the fourth quarter from the timing of some of the cash receipts on Combat?
Phebe Novakovic: I don't think we've broken out cash for you by business group. I think Kim tends to give you a fair amount of color on what was going on in the third and particularly the fourth quarter of unwinding some of the prebuilds in Combat with the deliveries of those vehicles and material.
Operator: We'll go next to Doug Harned at Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Doug.
Douglas Harned: If we look at Gulfstream and kind of look through the current margin issues, and when you get out to 2026, you should be at a point where you've got a full portfolio of maturing aircraft, commonality. And if we go back to the days when you could get to those 18% to 20%-type margins, is there a way to think about the progression here? There are clearly near-term issues. You've got the G800 to 400. How do you see working through those, the implication for margins? And where you would come out when you're what I would say, more of a normalized mode?
Phebe Novakovic: I'd say there's good potential for higher margins along the lines that we had seen in the past. But exactly when at this point, it's hard to pinpoint. But I think we're pretty confident and pleased with long-term margin trajectory at Aerospace for all the reasons that I think you quite potently listed.
Douglas Harned: And then just changing gears. When you look at munitions, I know you're expanding capacity substantially. A lot of people look at the situation in Europe. We've got an election coming up. And when you look at the demand for munitions, if you run that out five, six, seven years, how do you see that? Because others are -- Rheinmetall and others are also ramping up here. How do you see that extending over time?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, it's hard to look into a crystal ball much past a planning period. But we anticipate for the next couple of years, increased munitions orders as dictated by the threat environment. And we're pretty confident in that. So that's kind of how I look at it. It's awfully difficult to predict the threat environment with any kind of clarity other than pure speculation outside the next couple of years.
Douglas Harned: I was asking because as you think about this build out. And for what period of time are you looking at is kind of what I was getting at in terms of growth?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, a couple of years. I wasn't clear on that. I apologize. Yes, I'd say a couple of years of this. I'd say three, four years max, somewhere along those lines. And then we'll see. I think there have been some profound lessons learned about the criticality of munitions, ammunition. So I expect those to be incorporated in force is thinking.
Douglas Harned: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, Phebe, you increased the sales at Gulfstream, but no change in deliveries. Is that an ASP or a services-driven higher revenue base?
Phebe Novakovic: A couple of things, including services, as I had noticed, increase in services and also an increase in special mission which are kind of lumpy, as you know, and we've talked about in the past.
Myles Walton: Okay. Got it. And then just another detailed question. Thanks for the color on the unit improvement in margins. Are the unit quantities about 20 aircraft is Lot 1? And then secondarily, when you move to the 800, the G800, should we anticipate a similar profile of profitability? Or do you think you'll be at higher profit sooner on the 800 out of the gates? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: Planning purposes is the latter. But that's probably all the clarity we've got at the moment. It all depends on the certification process, but we anticipate, I think and reasonably anticipate that they'll come out of the gate very strong.
Myles Walton: Okay. And where that lost quantity is about [indiscernible]?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes.
Myles Walton: Okay, thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: It's typical lot quantities.
Operator: We'll go next to Scott Deuschle at Deutsche Bank.
Scott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Scott Deuschle: Phebe, can you characterize the ramp-up of this new munitions facility in Texas you opened up during the quarter? I guess, are you likely to exit 3Q at a relatively full run rate? Or is the ramp more gradual from that? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: So we opened up the facility. The first line is running and producing as we anticipated. We are standing up lines 3 and 4. So that's a material increase in the throughput of that facility, but it's a modern facility with a very strong and good workforce. So we're pretty encouraged that we will quickly come down our learning curves and produce at or above our plan.
Scott Deuschle: Great. And Kim, just to clarify your earlier comments, are you expecting working capital to be a source of cash in 3Q?
Kimberly Kuryea: Yes. But I would say that when you look at the cash profile for the rest of the year, most of that cash does come in the fourth quarter. So most of that working capital will unwind in the fourth quarter, not the third quarter.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. So modestly positive in 3Q?
Kimberly Kuryea: Yes.
Scott Deuschle: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move to our next question from Robert Stallard at Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Phebe, a couple of physical questions for you. First of all, on the U.S., if the Ukraine supplemental were to be 0, what sort of risk could that present to GD in the future? And then second, in the U.K., a change of government over here, whether there's any implications for AJAX down the line? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: I will take that in the inverse order. Don't anticipate any particular changes in AJAX. The vehicle is performing extremely well. The U.K. Army is pleased with it. So I think that, that's a standard piece of kit for the U.K. Army. With respect to the U.S., I think it's -- the Ukrainian supplemental certainly helped, but was not the only source of funding for munitions. And frankly, the munitions demand is a reality independent of, I think a lot of other things based on the lessons learned that most land forces, I believe have incorporated at this point. So we expect that to continue.
Robert Stallard: Okay, thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman at JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: One quick specific one on Gulfstream. The out-of-station work you talked about due to late supplier deliveries, is that behind us now as well?
Phebe Novakovic: The supply chain has improved, but it is not completely healed yet. So I suspect we'll continue to have some out-of-station work.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Okay. And then more broadly, the comment you made at the end of the prepared remarks about potentially revisiting the guidance with the Q3 earnings. Is that because of uncertainty in any particular area or just kind of broadly across the businesses?
Phebe Novakovic: I think that in this growth environment, revenue has been harder for us to predict. And just the input of contract executions and the impact of contract execution. So that's why we have a little less clarity than we typically do at this point, as revenue is a bit harder for us to identify with the kind of certainty that we typically can.
Seth Seifman: Okay, very good. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ellen Page at Jefferies.
Ellen Page: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just starting on the G700. You mentioned Block 3 was at a steady-state margin. How do we think about that relative to the G650? When would that kind of peak margin?
Phebe Novakovic: I don't have that exact comparison, but these are going to be very healthy margins, as you can imagine, on these airplanes.
Ellen Page: Okay. Thank you. And then just moving to Marine. As we think about the high growth this year, how do we think about that continuing into 2025? Or should we assume?
Phebe Novakovic: So this is -- we continue to see a strong growth profile for the Marine Group for the foreseeable future. In fact, for some time to come. Driven by, as I noted before, the threat environment. So growth is continuing. Some years, it will be a higher rate of growth than others, but it is a growth trajectory.
Ellen Page: Thank you. I'll leave it there.
Operator: And next, we'll move to Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Good morning everyone.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Noah Poponak: Phebe, I guess if I look at the funded backlog at Gulfstream, it's been relatively flattish over the last kind of year, 1.5 years. I know you have overall good demand for the new products. But how are you thinking about matching supply to demand as you're going to ramp deliveries here? Do you have visibility that the orders will keep pace with that? Do you have any concern about taking the revenue run rate above the order rate?
Phebe Novakovic: So I think we've got a very balanced plan through this year and the way we think about the market. Certainly, the pipeline supports that and has supported it. There's an awful lot of interest in these new airplanes. So I think we've planned accordingly. And I think as I tried to give you some color in the remarks, the pipeline remains strong, and that's the best indicator of near-term future growth.
Noah Poponak: Okay. How far out into the future does the pipeline go in terms of your level of visibility and confidence in what the order flow will look like?
Phebe Novakovic: It doesn't stand to reason that the further out you go in the future, the less your confidence is? It's actually, I think a truism. But for what we can see, we're -- we like what we see in the pipeline.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And Kim, did you -- I apologize if I missed it, did you provide a new free cash flow to net income conversion goal for the year? And then, I guess just any comment on how to think about that next year if there are some abnormalities this year that reverse next year?
Kimberly Kuryea: So in terms of for this year, we're still targeting the conversion rate of approaching 100%. Obviously, a lot of that cash is going to come in the fourth quarter of this year, based on our profile this year. And honestly, we are still in the planning process for next year. So we're not at the point that we're ready to give any cash flow guidance for next year.
Noah Poponak: Okay, thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: So Adra [ph], I think we have time for just one more question.
Operator: Thank you. That question comes from Matt Akers at Wells Fargo.
Matthew Akers: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Matthew Akers: There was a fire at the Camden, Arkansas facility. Can you guys comment if that was material at all and if that is back online at this point?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, that was a tragedy for the individual, the family and for us. From a business perspective, it's a very small line.
Matthew Akers: Got it. Thanks. And I guess if you could comment on maybe the outlook at NASSCO? Just between the repair work and you guys recently won the sub tender work there, just kind of how you see the outlook for that yard?
Phebe Novakovic: So NASSCO learning and performance on the T-AO, the oiler is going quite well. We're delivering the seventh of the A-class ESB, and repair continues to be pretty strong as the demand from the U.S. Navy is increasing.
Nicole Shelton: Thank you, everyone for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3152.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. 
 And I would now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Nicole Shelton: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. 
 We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. 
 On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer. 
 I will now turn the call over to Phebe. 
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.88 per diluted share on revenue of $10.7 billion, operating earnings of $1.036 billion and net earnings of $799 million. These results compare quite favorably to the year ago quarter. Revenue is up 8.6% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up 10.4%. Net earnings are up 9.5%. As a result, earnings per diluted share up $0.24, or 9.1% more than the year ago quarter. The operating margin for the entire company was 9.7%, a 20 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. 
 Overall, these numbers represent a very strong quarter and a good start to 2024. However, we fell below our own expectations for the quarter and below analyst consensus, which is predicated at least in part on our forecast. The rather obvious explanation is that we forecast 15 to 17 G700 deliveries in the quarter, which did not happen. 
 We received FAA certification for the G700 at the very end of the quarter, too late to make any G700 deliveries. This obviously impacted revenue and earnings in the Aerospace group in the quarter. The good news is that we now have certification, and the delay in deliveries does not change our outlook for the year. Gulfstream still plans to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year. So our Aerospace forecast for the year remains unchanged. I'll give you a little more color on this later in my remarks. Another good news, as you can see, was strong performance across the defense portfolio. In short, we performed very well in the quarter over those things within our control. 
 At this point, let me ask Kim Kuryea, our CFO, to provide details on our order activity, solid backlog and cash activity before I come back with segment observations. 
Kimberly Kuryea: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders and backlog. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1:1 for the company. Order activity was particularly strong in the Combat Systems group with a book-to-bill of 1.6:1 and in the Aerospace and Technologies segment, which each had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $93.7 billion, up slightly from year-end and up 4% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at approximately $134 billion, up 1.5% from year-end. 
 Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We had an expected slow start to the year, absent the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700 and continued G700 inventory build. 
 So let's start with Technologies. We continue to see strong cash performance from that group in the quarter. As anticipated, Combat Systems and Marine Systems both built working capital in the quarter based on their unique mix of contract timing versus expected payments. 
 Finally, moving to Aerospace. The lack of G700 deliveries drove us to use cash in the quarter. As a result, our free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $437 million. Since all of what I described is timing related, we still have an expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate around 100%. We expect most of the negative free cash flow to reverse in the second quarter, followed by substantially improving free cash flow in each of the third and fourth quarters. 
 Now to discuss our capital deployment activities. Capital expenditures were $159 million, or 1.5% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year, as we anticipate spending between 2% and 2.5% of revenue on CapEx this year. Over 50% of that expected spend will be for infrastructure at our 3 shipyards as we continue to invest to support the Navy submarine and shipbuilding plan. 
 Also in the quarter, we paid $361 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 390,000 shares of stock for $105 million at just under $269 per share. When you add it all up, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of around $1 billion and a net debt position of $8.2 billion. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $82 million compared with $91 million for the same quarter last year. The reduction in interest expense was attributed to our lower debt balances. 
 Finally, turning to income taxes. We had a 17.5% effective tax rate in the quarter, right in line with our full year guidance, which reflects higher taxes on foreign earnings. 
 Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you. 
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Kim. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace did very well in the absence of the G700 delivery. It had revenue of $2.1 billion and operating earnings of $255 million with a 12.2% operating margin. Revenue is $192 million more than last year's first quarter, a 10.1% increase. 
 To give you a little detail here, the increase was driven by an increase in new aircraft deliveries and an increase in services at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation, partially offset by significantly lower special mission aircraft activity, which is always lumpy. The 24 deliveries in the quarter are fewer than planned but 3 more than the year ago quarter. The mix in the quarter favored large cabin and the 650 in particular, which helped both revenue and earnings. Operating earnings of $255 million are up $26 million over last year's first quarter, an 11.4% increase. Earnings on both new aircraft and aircraft services enjoyed good increases, offset in part by lower earnings on special mission, higher G&A and net R&D. 
 While Gulfstream will continue to experience part shortages that cause significant out-of-station work, which is inherently less efficient, the supply chain is clearly improving and much more predictable. As is now apparent, we plan to deliver a considerable number of G700s in 2024, the first 20 to be delivered or fully built, and deliveries have begun. By the end of this month, the next 7 to 8 will be ready. We plan to deliver these 50 to 52 planes over the quarters in relatively even numbers, with improving margins quarter-over-quarter as we go along. The first one, what we call the lot 1, carries some cost and retrofit burden that will not affect subsequent aircraft deliveries. So expect margins in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter with significant improvement in Q3 and Q4. 
 Aerospace had a decent quarter from an orders perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.2:1 in dollar terms. Sales activity and customer interest is evident this quarter, but concerns over persistent inflation and monetary policy in the U.S., together with concerns about conflict in the Middle East, has slowed the consummation of transactions to some degree. It is also worth noting that a significant portion of the demand we see is fleet replenishment for corporations. These multi-aircraft deals usually proceed at a slower pace. 
 The G800 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature. We continue to target certification of G800 for 9 months after the G700 certification, although I'm increasingly reluctant to give estimates about these things that are ultimately out of our control. In short, the Aerospace team had a good quarter. G700 FAA certification is in the rearview mirror, and we hope EASA certification is hard on its heels. And we expect nicely improving margins, particularly in the second half. 
 Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $2.1 billion, up almost 20% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $282 million are up 15.1%. Margins at 13.4% are down 60 basis points over the year ago quarter. It is interesting to observe that this very strong increase in revenue is in comparison to last year's first quarter, which enjoyed a 5% increase over '22. 
 We saw increased revenue performance in each of the 3 businesses. The increase came from higher volume on new international tank programs, higher artillery program volume and higher volume on PIRANHA's programs and bridges. We also experienced very strong order performance. Orders in the quarter drove total backlog to $15.6 billion, up $1.5 billion from this time in the year ago quarter. 
 Demand for Combat Systems and products continues to increase, particularly in Europe and in some lines of business in the U.S. Orders for wheeled and tracked combat vehicles are up significantly, reflecting the heightened threat environment. In addition to several new combat vehicle starts, demand for Abrams also continues. We've seen tank orders from new users, and a number of countries will be introducing Abrams into their combat fleets for the first time. 
 Since Q1 last year, we have received almost $1 billion in orders from both U.S. allies through FMS and the U.S. Army. In the U.S., we are rapidly increasing ammunition production with the opening of our Texas facility, which will increase current 155-millimeter ammo capacity by 83%. As the year goes on, we will continue to work with our Army customer to further increase ammo capacity to meet their requirements. 
 Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me repeat the recent history that I gave you last year at this time with respect to growth in this decade. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against Q1 of 2019; Q1 '21 was up 10.6% over Q1 '20; Q1 '22 was up 6.8% over Q1 '21; and Q1 '23 was up 12.9% over Q1 '22. Finally, this quarter at $3.3 billion is up 11.3% over Q1 '23. 
 This is an impressive growth ramp by any standard. However, growth ramps of this character bring with them supply chain and operation issues that are challenging. This particular quarter's growth was almost exclusively Columbia-class construction. 
 Operating earnings are $232 million in the quarter, up 10% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin is basically the same as last year's quarter. We anticipate that this will improve as we progress through the year. 
 As we have talked about in previous calls, the story at the marine group is efficiently managing the growth propelled by the U.S. Navy's need for ships, particularly submarines. As a labor-intensive heavy manufacturing industry, the shipbuilding industrial base was hit hard by the demographic impacts of COVID. This, coupled with a number of sole-source suppliers of highly complex components, has made it difficult for the industrial base to keep pace with increasing demand. 
 The significant financial investments we have made in our shipyards over the last 12 years, particularly at Electric Boat, has mitigated the impact on us, but we are still hit by schedule and quality problems in the supply chain. Our job is to minimize the efficiency and schedule impacts of late material by increasing our throughput. And we are doing that each and every quarter. In Q1 alone, our productivity increased 11%, but there is more to do. Finally, the Navy's investment in the supply chain has helped and will continue to help as we move forward. 
 For Technologies, we're off to a solid start. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion is down less than 1% from the prior year but up 2% over the fourth quarter of last year, and modestly ahead of our expectation to the start of the year. Operating earnings of $295 million are consistent with last year, yielding a margin of 9.2%. As we have previously discussed, margins will continue to be driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volumes. 
 The group received $4 billion in orders during the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1. Both businesses experienced strong order activity, in GDIT's case, the highest book-to-bill since mid-2019. This led to a total backlog of $13.5 billion, an increase of over 5% from a year ago and total estimated contract value of $42.7 billion. 
 The story in Technologies is one of steady growth, particularly at GDIT and increasingly at Mission Systems as they transition from legacy programs to new programs and faster-growth lines of business. Both businesses have robust pipelines driven by their respective investments in different technologies. The group's continued focus on margin performance will result in sequential margin expansion throughout the year as they continue to build their backlog and grow. 
 As you know, we never update guidance at this time of year. Apart from what I have already said about Aerospace, I will stick to that custom. We do, however, confirm the guidance we gave you at the end of last quarter, and we'll update it at midpoint of the year, as we typically do. 
 This concludes my remarks with respect to what was, in many respects, a rewarding quarter. Let me now turn the call back to Nicole to take your questions. 
Nicole Shelton: Thank you, Phebe. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. 
Scott Deuschle: Kim, can you clarify the G700 delivery expectation for the second quarter? Is it the 20 that are ready to go plus the 7 to 8 that will be ready at the end of this month? 
Phebe Novakovic: So let me kind of tackle that. I alluded to it in my opening statement. But we're -- we have 50 to 52 airplanes that are going to deliver in about equal amounts of the 700 in the second through the fourth quarters. So think about it that way. So I think that will help you. 
Scott Deuschle: Okay. And then, Phebe, I was hoping you could spend a moment maybe talking about the growth that Combat Systems is currently seeing in Europe and perhaps how you expect that to trend over the coming quarters. 
Phebe Novakovic: So the growth in Europe is clearly driven by the threat environment. We've seen increases in orders for combat, wheeled and tracked vehicles and significant bridge orders. We're also seeing increased orders coming out of various countries in Europe for Abrams through the FMS process. So we see that demand signal continuing until the threat environment, frankly, improves. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. 
Seth Seifman: Looking to marine. When we think about the expectation for the profit margin for the year and kind of where we started, are there kind of visible milestones that you see through the remainder of the year that bring that number higher? Or kind of is it a change in mix? Or kind of what drives the underlying margin improvement through the year? 
Phebe Novakovic: So two things. One is the increase in productivity at each of the shipyards, and we see that and we've been seeing that for the last few quarters. And it's also fewer disruptions from the supply chain. So those are the two primary factors. 
Seth Seifman: Right. Okay, okay. Great. And then just when we think about -- I think you mentioned some of the headwinds to demand at Gulfstream from here in terms of monetary policy, geopolitical issues. Just to kind of affirm the expectation for 160 deliveries this year and the way that the backlog will trend through the year, the expectation is that, that's a very sustainable number with potential for that to grow in the years beyond. 
Phebe Novakovic: So let me clarify a bit. I don't see concerns about inflation or monetary policy impacting demand. It really is just impacting the time from the initiation of a potential interest to the closure of an order, which is also impacted somewhat by large fleet -- airplane fleet orders from corporate customers. So think about it that way, more of a timing issue with the completion of the deals and not a headwind to overall demand. So I think that's an important nuance. And we're still sticking to our delivery guidance for the year. And I think on a going-forward basis, as we've intimated before, we see that those deliveries increasing over time. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. 
Robert Stallard: Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the recently passed or soon to be signed supplemental and what implications that could have for the combat business, but also on the submarine side, what sort of additional funding could come from the U.S. Navy? 
Phebe Novakovic: So let me take them in the inverse order. On the submarine side, the preponderance of the funding in the supplemental is to help stabilize the industrial base, ensuring that we continue to drive order activity on a consistent and repeatable basis. So that is really on the submarine side. In combat, I think you can see there's a fair amount of ammo funding, and we had fully anticipated that. 
Robert Stallard: Okay. And then just secondly, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the AJAX program in the U.K. 
Phebe Novakovic: So it is proceeding extremely well through test, continue to work with that customer, but they are very pleased with the performance of the vehicle. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. 
Sheila  Kahyaoglu: I wanted to ask one about Aerospace, and I'm sorry for putting you on the spot with the mental math. But last year -- or last quarter, you talked about the G700 profit contribution being around 25%. So when we think about the Q1 performance, it was actually really good relative to our number of 12.1% margin. It would imply you see a deceleration in the underlying business for Aerospace just given G700 comes in at 50 units. So I guess, how do we think about the mix movement throughout the year for Aerospace? 
Phebe Novakovic: Well, let's talk about the first predicate in that question. I don't believe we've ever disclosed any margin on a particular airplane, and we haven't there. I think we can't -- it can't take and discern revenue and earnings in any given quarter as attributable to one airplane. So I think you need to think about it holistically.
 But we see the -- we don't see any real changes in the mix throughout the year. And we'll do a detailed bottom-up review in Q2. But for right now, we're sticking with both our mix, our earnings, our margin and revenue expectations. So we're off to a pretty good start, I'd say. And we're very encouraged at how the outlook looks for the rest of the year. 
Sheila  Kahyaoglu: Can we assume that G700 is accretive to the 15% full year guidance? 
Phebe Novakovic: So think about it this way. This is ultimately going to be a very profitable program. But as I explained in my remarks, the first lot of 20 or so carries with it additional cost. We'll see those in -- largely in Q2. So think about Q2 as an increase in revenue of about $1 billion to $1.1 billion and in earnings of about $100 million to $110 million, and then progress nicely thereafter. And again, that's all impacted by the multiplicity of factors in our Aerospace business that drive margins. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from David Strauss with Barclays. 
David Strauss: Phebe, so Rob's question on the supplemental and the submarine industrial base money, so there's money there. There's a lot of money in the base budget, it appears. You're spending additional CapEx today that you'll eventually recover through working capital, profit. How does -- I mean, it's a lot of money. I mean how does that manifest itself in your numbers as we think about over the next couple of years? 
Phebe Novakovic: So for the supply chain support, it has minimal impact on us. It's, however, extremely important because the stabilization of the supply chain is critical to the resumption of full cadence on Virginia and the increased cadence on Columbia.
 So funding is also robust for submarines. We've got one we projected in '25. And then it would be extremely helpful to get a full ship set of Virginias also appropriated because that, again, helps stabilize the industrial base with repeatable revenue that they can plan around. 
David Strauss: Okay. Last quarter, you made some more kind of positive comments regarding the potential for share repurchase to step up. Obviously, you did a little bit this quarter, but not that much. How are you thinking about that now? Did that have to do with the fact that you ended up burning cash in Q1? Just how you're thinking about share repo and the balance sheet from here. 
Phebe Novakovic: So the way we think about share repurchases, and this will be true going forward, is really in the regular order. Recall what we were facing in Q1. And that was we're looking down the throat of a potential, and at some point looked very likely, government shutdown. And so I think that prudence and conservatism in the face of that kind of uncertainty is really key. But the cash performance for the remainder of the year is going to be very strong, and we will act accordingly. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. 
Noah Poponak: Phebe, what's the framework for the pace of G700 deliveries beyond this year compared to this year? Not asking for quarterly numbers or anything like that, but just given this year's had some abnormalities compared to a recurring airplane. And then, Kim, just what's the updated view on free cash flow to net income conversion for the year? 
Phebe Novakovic: Well, so let me talk about 700. We never, except I think, on 1 or 2 occasions about 5, 6 years ago, give the future year expectations. But 700 is a very, very successful program, and it will continue to execute well.
 I'll turn it over to Kim on cash. 
Kimberly Kuryea: On cash. Thank you, Phebe. So with respect to cash and the expectation, we still anticipate achieving about 100% of free cash flow conversion in 2024. We had expected the first quarter to be negative even before considering the fact that we didn't deliver any G700. So we had planned for a negative free cash flow in the first quarter, and that was mostly driven by some contract timing in the Combat Systems segment and some in the Marine Systems segment. But we expect that most of that negative cash will reverse in the second quarter with a stronger third quarter and then a steeper ramp in the fourth quarter. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. 
Myles Walton: Phebe, could you comment on -- or Kim, could you comment on the margin expansion implied at Combat Systems as you move through the rest of the year? I think it has to be 80 to 100 basis points on average up year-on-year for the rest of the year. And maybe the underlying dynamics of given the volume, why we didn't see more of a drop-through margin in the first quarter? 
Phebe Novakovic: So what drove margin in the first quarter were two things: mix as we came off of older legacy programs, particularly in the vehicle world and in the U.S. and then -- and began ramping up newer programs, vehicle programs in the U.S.; and then a significant amount of the revenue growth came from facilities investment which, by definition, carries a lower margin than production. So both of those things will reverse throughout the course of the year, and combat margins will increase. Our expectation is quarter-over-quarter. Remember, this is a high operating leverage group. So they ought to do quite well here. 
Myles Walton: Okay. And one clarification on Gulfstream's backlog, if I could. I think that there were some adjustment downward in the backlog. Were those cancellations or ForEx, maybe 6 large jet cancellations or thereabouts? 
Phebe Novakovic: I don't think that's the way to look at it. But why don't Nicole get back to you on that? But we didn't have any particular notable cancellations. So let us unpack that one with you a little later. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. 
Ronald Epstein: So Phebe, with the increased demand on munitions and so on and so forth, I mean, what are you doing to mitigate any of the issues that could arise from growth in those markets, just like we've seen in the Navy markets given all the demand and growth? There's been supply chain issues. Are you expecting... 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So in the combat world, it's a little bit more of a robust supply chain in general that we typically have not had difficulty with, typically. We know our priority. The suppliers who could conceivably cause issues, and we've been working with them to ensure that they can manage this growth. But we're pretty comfortable that we can execute the growth. Our focus is really on operations and execution. And those will be the  two key drivers of the profitability in that group. 
Ronald Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then maybe back to the kind of the naval side of the house and the supply chain. Could you give us any color on where there are actual weaknesses in the supply chain where investment has to be made? 
Phebe Novakovic: So I'd say in the large -- in the single-source, sole-source suppliers who are, by definition, critical. And the Navy has focused quite intensely on those particular products and supply chain items. And I think they've been pretty explicit about where some of that might be. And I think it's best to think about it that way. But we do believe that working with the Navy customer, the continued infusion into that supply chain will help stabilize. But they are the pacing item now for Electric Boat. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Doug Harned with Bernstein. 
Douglas Harned: On marine, the Navy recently described some shipbuilding delays really across programs. And the one that really stood out was Columbia-class delays reported on the turbines and the bow. Can you give us a sense of changes you've seen in schedule that affect you kind of across the program base and particularly on Columbia? 
Phebe Novakovic: So I think you've articulated what the Navy has said. I will tell you, our throughput and productivity has been strong on Columbia. It enjoys the highest national security priority. So we have done pretty well on Columbia and are increasing our throughput on Columbia. So then it's really those pacing items that are out there. And we're working with our Navy customer to see if there are additional things we can do to recover some schedule and if there are any workarounds. But this is going to be a bit of a slog for the supply chain. 
Douglas Harned: And then also on shipbuilding, inflation has affected shipbuilding costs a lot over the last few years. We've seen pricing on new awards go up. And when you look forward in the budget, is there a concern that you're basically, if you're going to -- if the Navy's budget is really going to be able to afford the kinds of inflation increases that may come along with the continued ramp in shipbuilding? 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So I think you've known over the years, I tend not to comment on individual service budgeting. But inflation certainly has been a factor. And to the extent that we can increase throughput to offset some of that, we will. But the Navy is well aware of the inflation impact and I think is working hard with the whole shipbuilding industrial base to adjust some of that. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. 
Kristine Liwag: Phebe, following up on the marine question. In addition to the delay in the Columbia class, the DoD did request one less Virginia class for the fiscal year '25 budget request. So I mean, if we take all this into perspective, can you provide some context on what this means for marine revenue growth over the next few years? And does the margin with a 7 handle on it, is that more the new norm for this business? 
Phebe Novakovic: So let me address that in the inverse order. Margins will be improving at our shipyards. We have every expectation all of our shipyards, NASSCO, Bath and Electric Boat. One of the things, as we've talked frequently about, is the margin impact of quality and schedule problems coming out of the supply chain. And as the supply chain stabilizes, that will help as well. And what was your first part of your question? 
Kristine Liwag: The revenue cadence, including the just one Virginia class for fiscal year '25. 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. Okay. So it has no impact in the short term for Electric Boat because we've got plenty of work in front of us. It could have an impact in the outer years outside of our planning horizon. But critical here is, in fact, the additional ship set of funding. We have long lead material on Virginia. That is very important to the supply chain. And to the extent that we can ensure that we get a full second Virginia ship set so that we're buying it to a year, I think, is very important for the overall health of the industrial -- submarine and industrial base. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Ken Herbert with RBC. 
Kenneth Herbert: If we look, Phebe, at your comments around timing in Gulfstream, is it still fair to assume that you should be looking at a book-to-bill at 1 or greater for Gulfstream in '24? 
Phebe Novakovic: So it's a good planning assumption. It is how we are thinking about our internal planning. But let's see how we do as we start to significantly ramp up production and deliveries. So -- but as I said, that's a good planning assumption. 
Kenneth Herbert: Okay. Great. And just a clarification for Kim. The comments sound like the free cash flow ramp really sort of accelerates in the second half of the year. But with all the 700 deliveries expected this quarter, free cash flow should be positive in the second quarter, correct? 
Kimberly Kuryea: Yes. That's pretty much what you should assume. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. 
Robert Spingarn: Phebe, you said recently that with the -- even though the aerospace supply chain is improving, your ramp this year could challenge that improvement. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit. 
Phebe Novakovic: So we still have -- look, it's definitely improving. Quality is improving and schedule reliability is improving. But make no mistake, we still have a lot of out-of-station work. And that impacts the profitability and margin on airplanes that are experiencing that. So we definitely see improvement. We are optimistic that they can keep pace, but it's not without its margin challenges. 
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then also, I think you commented you had good bookings in Aerospace in the quarter, reflecting strong demand. But I think you've said the U.S. has been very strong. How is aircraft demand elsewhere in the world? 
Phebe Novakovic: So there's no real change, I think, from the previous quarters, U.S. corporations, private and public, high-net-worth individuals, both U.S. and outside the U.S. So no real changes, no real surprises. Sort of the typical customer base that we see is I think the way you should think about it. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Peter Arment with Baird. 
Peter Arment: Phebe, the Army wants to reach 100,000 155 shells by, I think, October 2025. Can you update us on how your ramp is going? You've discussed that, that supply chain is a little more robust. 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So our ramp there is more about increasing the facilities that we have. And as I noted in my remarks, the opening of our Texas facility, which we worked very, very hard to expedite and frankly did it in almost record time, was very important because it increased the throughput and the productivity of the number of shells by 83%. So we're on track with the Army to get where we need to be, and our objective is to move even faster. And so far, we have been. But the Army has been a critical and extremely important partner here in what is really a national security imperative. 
Peter Arment: Yes. And then just if you could make any comments on the G280 program just given the conflict that's going on in the Middle East. 
Phebe Novakovic: So we had anticipated the impacts on the 280 in our guidance too, but I will tell you that they are doing quite well and are slightly ahead of our schedule. We're still sticking to our deliveries, but I think it's notable that they're managing pretty well in this tough environment. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. 
Cai Von Rumohr: Good quarter. 
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Cai. 
Cai Von Rumohr: So could you update us on the status of the G400? How is it doing? And is it fair to assume that it might have a gap of approximately 12 months between its certification and that of the G800? 
Phebe Novakovic: I think I said last quarter, I'm done predicting process over which we have little control. We've tried in the past to give you indicators of our internal -- or actually, our internal -- our dates. So I'm kind of out of the detailed predicting mode. I will say the program is doing extremely well. And it's -- it will fly in the third quarter, and I think we'll be flying a pretty mature airplane. 
Cai Von Rumohr: Excellent. And then your R&D was up a fair amount in the first quarter. Could you give us some color of the pattern of the R&D at Gulfstream this year and looking forward? How should we think about that? 
Phebe Novakovic: Well, pretty much steady as she goes, particularly this year. We've got a number of, as you know, programs in the certification process. And so I'd see that at least through this year is pretty consistent. No real surprise this year, steady as she goes. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jason Gursky with Citigroup. 
Jason Gursky: Phebe, I wanted to just quickly go back to your comments on Aerospace and what, I guess, you described as an elongation of your sales cycle. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the overall size of the pipeline and how that is evolving. I understand things are taking longer to close, but I'd also be kind of curious to know whether there are an increasing number of people that are interested. 
Phebe Novakovic: So the pipeline remains robust. And I look to that as encouraging, a good sign. It's been that way for a while. People want our airplanes, and that's driving demand. 
Jason Gursky: Okay. Great. So good metrics going on there, it sounds like. Then just really quickly on -- maybe this is a question targeted at Technologies. But I'd love to get some updated thoughts from you on artificial intelligence, AI, the adoption that you're seeing with your customers. How you see this kind of playing out and affecting your business. And then maybe, as I suggest, focused on Technologies. 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So we have been investing in AI to support our customers, and particularly at GDIT and somewhat at Mission Systems. And I would say that there, we're working closely with our customers. They define what the art of the possible is for them in AI. And as you all know, there are some government -- governance challenges around that. But the more sophisticated we get and our ability  to tailor AI solutions, I think the more comfortable our customer becomes and will ultimately drive some increased revenue.
 I haven't seen too much of that yet because I think the government is not like -- unlike other industries where its adoption is. People are careful, and I think properly so. And I would argue that would be true across the entirety of our business. 
Operator: Our final question today comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS. 
Gavin Parsons: Phebe, you highlighted the stronger second half Aerospace margins that's a more normal volume and G700 production. Is that more of an appropriate starting point for 2025 than the full year 15%? 
Phebe Novakovic: Nice try. So look, yes, I think once you get through the first lot, our performance from a margin standpoint will continue to improve. And you'll see that, third quarter will be significantly better than second quarter, and fourth quarter will be even better still. But we will update you on our regular order. We kind of keep our discipline, as you well know, around updating guidance, and I think that, that's appropriate. 
Gavin Parsons: Yes. I appreciate that detail. And then just in terms of the 100% cash conversion for the year, what's the opportunity to exceed that given last year, you were well above and you built a lot of G700 inventory? 
Kimberly Kuryea: I think right now, we're just focused. Given the steep ramp in the second half of the year, we're really focusing on trying to hit that mark at this point in time. 
Phebe Novakovic: And we should get there. 
Nicole Shelton: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the first quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3152. 
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Nicole Shelton: Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I’ll turn the call over to Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.64 per diluted share on revenue of $11,668,000,000, operating earnings of $1,288,000,000, and net earnings of $1,000,000,000. Revenue is up $817 million, a strong 7.5% against the fourth quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $61 million, and earnings per share are up $0.06, or 1.7%. The year-ago quarter had $52 million more of other net income, which helps explain the more modest earnings per share growth. In short, the quarter-over-quarter results compare quite favourably, particularly revenue and operating earnings. The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $1,097,000, a very strong 10.4%, operating earnings by $231 million, or 21.9%, net earnings by $169 million or 20.2%, and EPS by $0.60, a 19.7% improvement. As we promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest of the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, revenue, earnings per share, operating earnings, and net earnings improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $42.3 billion, up 7.3%, and operating earnings of $4.25 billion, up 0.8%, and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.02, down $0.17, a 1.4% decrease, mostly as a result of below-the-line items like other income, which was higher, and the tax provision, which was lower in 2022. The fourth quarter in the year are $0.04 and $0.09 respectively, below consensus. It is important to note that consensus lowered during the two weeks before this earnings release, as the sell side became aware of Gulfstream's deliveries from public sources. This miss was exclusively because the G700 did not certify before year end. As a result, Gulfstream was unable to deliver 15 G700s as we and the sell side had anticipated. I will have more to say about this in my segment remarks. While we miss consensus and our own expectations for reasons beyond our control, it should not distract from an otherwise good quarter and year. Let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong cash performance for the quarter and the year, overall order activity, and backlog, and any other items you might like to address.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phoebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were a strong story for us in 2023. We finished the year with total backlog of $93.6 billion, up $2.5 billion over last year. Total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, was nearly $132 billion. In terms of orders, the aerospace segment led the way with a 1.2 to 1 book-to-bill ratio in both the fourth quarter and full year, and they ended the year with total backlog of $20.5 billion. The defense segments had a book-to-bill of 0.7 times in the fourth quarter and one-to-one for the full year. Overall, the company had a book-to-bill of 1.1 times for the year, and all four segments were one-to-one or better. Turning to our cash performance, it was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, which brings us to $4.7 billion of operating cash flow for the year. As discussed on previous calls, this level of cash flow was achieved on the strength of Gulfstream orders, additional payments on Combat Systems international programs, and continued strong cash performance in technologies. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was $3.8 billion, a cash conversion rate of 115%. This was nicely ahead of our anticipated cash flow for the year, notwithstanding the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures, as I noted on the last call, were higher in the fourth quarter at $304 million, which brings us to $904 million for the full year. The lion's share of these investments are of course, in our shipyards to support the Navy's submarine and shipbuilding plan. At 2.1% of sales, full year capital expenditures were a little lower than our original expectation due to timing, so some of that naturally pushes into next year. As a result, we expect CapEx to be between 2% and 2.5% of sales next year and closer to 2% thereafter. We also paid $360 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.4 billion. There were no shares repurchased in the quarter, so we finished the year with two million shares repurchased for $434 million at $215 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $106 million in 2023, which included a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, and we expect to contribute approximately $75 million in 2024. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $7.3 billion, down approximately $1.9 billion, more than 20% from last year. We have $500 million of debt maturing in 2024. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $78 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $343 million. That compares to $85 million and $364 million in the respective 2022 periods. We expect interest expense in 2024 to continue to decrease to around $320 million. Turning to income taxes, we had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16.8%, slightly below, but generally in line with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17.5%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings. That concludes this portion of my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe for segment comments.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. First, aerospace; the story in aerospace is found in sequential and year-over-year improvement, continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, the overall strength of Gulfstream service business, and the continuing growth of jet aviation. In the quarter, aerospace had revenue of $2.74 billion and earnings of $449 million. This represents a 12% increase in revenue and a 33% increase in earnings on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The sequential numbers are even stronger, with a 35% increase in revenue coupled with a staggering 68% increase in operating earnings. The important point here is the dramatic increase in the delivery of in-service airplanes in the quarter, 39 versus 27 in the third quarter of 2023. A strong mix favoring large aircraft, strong pricing in the backlog, better overhead absorption, and improved supply chain response, leading to less out-of-station work, all contributed to a 16.4% margin in the quarter. For the full year, revenue of $8.62 billion is up only $54 million from the prior year, and operating earnings of $1.18 billion, improved by $52 million on a 50-basis point improvement in operating margin. Nevertheless, aerospace revenue and earnings are less than we anticipated for the quarter in the year because, as I mentioned earlier, we did not receive the certification of G700 in the fourth quarter and did not deliver 15 aircraft we had ready to go. That deprived us of slightly over a billion dollars of revenue and close to $250 million in earnings. These, of course, are orders of magnitude figures. We were also unable during the course of the year to increase production of in-service aircraft as planned because of well-known supply chain issues that began to resolve in the fourth quarter. So, where are we in our journey toward G700 certification? We are almost complete with the final technical inspection authorization. FAA function and reliability flight testing is almost done, and almost all of the paperwork associated with the process has been submitted. In the meantime, we are asking customers to schedule their pre-delivery inspections contemplating delivery this quarter. All that having been said, let me turn to the demand environment. The book-to-bill was 1.2 times in the quarter and 1.2 times for the year. Backlog increased $395 million sequentially and $938 million for the year. So, aerospace demand remained strong for both aircraft and services at Gulfstream and jet aviation. I should add that strong order intake was interrupted for a two- to three-week period twice during the year, once for a macroeconomic event and the second for a geopolitical event. I refer to the regional bank failures earlier in the year and the conflict initiated by the Hamas attack on Israel and the resultant conflict in Gaza. In each case, order intake resumed after a brief pause. As we go into the New Year, the sales pipeline remained strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. Aerospace backlog is up 72% since the first quarter of 2021 when we first detected a measurable uptake in order activity. In summary, aerospace results are in line with our original forecast, excluding the G700 certification delay. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2024 and improved operating margin, but I'll say more about this as we get to guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet Aviation to perform well in the year. Next, combat systems. Revenue in the quarter of $2.36 billion is up 8.5% from the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $351 million are up 5.7% on a 40-basis point decrease in operating margin, but still a very good 14.8%. The majority of the growth in the quarter was at ordnance and tactical systems and European land systems. It was largely driven by higher artillery and propellant volume, including programs to expand production volume, higher volume of piranhas, bridges and eagles in Europe, and new international tank programs. Not surprisingly, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $140 million or 6.3% and earnings are up $51 million or 17% on the strength of 130 basis point improvement in margins. From an order perspective, combat had a very good year with a 1.1 times book-to-bill, driven by very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank, growing demand on the munitions side of the business, and particular strength in Europe. By the way, combat's performance for the year significantly outperformed our expectations. 2023 revenue was up 13% against a flat forecast provided earlier in the year. Operating earnings are up $72 million or 6.7%, with operating margin at 13.9% for the year. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter and a year with strong revenue growth, strong margin performance, good order activity, and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Turning to marine, the powerful marine system's growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $3,408,000,000 is up 14.8% over the year ago quarter. Revenue is also up 13.5% sequentially, and 12.9% for the year. This was driven by Columbia class construction and engineering volume, TAO volume, and service contracts at bat. Operating earnings are down 8.4% over the year ago quarter on a 160 basis point reduction in operating margin attributable to EAC rate decreases at electric boats. These rate decreases similarly impact the sequential and annual comparison with respect to operating earnings. The EAC decreases were primarily driven by two factors, later than promised material to EB [ph], which drove additional out of station work at EB, and quality problems from several vendors. On the positive side, we are continuing to work with the Navy and the Congress to help further stabilize the supply chain with additional funding for work. We are also working with certain suppliers to set up process improvements where we can. EB also needs to continue to improve its productivity to help offset some of the financial impacts from the supply chain. Marine Systems had a one-time book-to-bill for the year, a good result for a group of shipyards that began the year with a total backlog of nearly $46 billion. Jason will now give you some color on the Technologies group for which he has responsibility, and then I'll return for our outlook for 2024.
Jason Aiken: The Technologies group had a solid quarter and a very strong year. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was down 3.1% compared with the prior year, while operating earnings of $305 million were down 10.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year, however, the group's revenue of $12.9 billion was up 3.4%, with both businesses experiencing nice growth. The results exceeded our expectations on strong demand for the group's products and services. GDIT fared particularly well with increased volume across each of its customer-facing segments; defense, intel, and federal civilian. Operating earnings of $1.2 billion were down by 2% versus the prior year on a 50-basis point contraction in operating margin to 9.3%, and that's solely a function of the revenue mix as IT services grew faster than the defense electronics portfolio. Turning back to the quarterly performance, to break it down between the two businesses, GDIT's revenue was up in all four quarters compared with 2022, and they've now grown their top line in each of the past three years. The same is true for mission systems' quarterly revenue performance, with the exception of the fourth quarter. If you recall, last year's fourth quarter saw us break through a logjam in the supply chain and deliver an unusually high number of products, lifting both revenue and margins. Barring that anomaly in 2022, the group's comparisons on a quarterly and full-year basis are quite favorable. With respect to order activity and backlog, the technologies group had a very good year, notwithstanding the continuing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. The individual businesses and the group as a whole achieved a one-to-one book-to-bill on solid revenue growth. GDIT received awards totalling $13.5 billion, far exceeding their previous annual record set the year before. They've got another $15 billion in awards pending adjudication and just shy of $2 billion in awards under protest. Mission systems had a great year as well, with a total value of submitted bids almost triple the level they saw in 2022. Of course, many of the group's awards come in the form of IDIQ contracts with potential value that doesn't initially hit the backlog. So much of these positive results will continue to manifest in the reported numbers over time. To that point, we ended the quarter with a total estimated contract value for the group of nearly $41 billion, and the group's combined qualified pipeline exceeds $130 billion; so all in all, a great year for the technologies group.
Phebe Novakovic: So let me provide our operating forecast for 2024 with some color around our outlook for each business group and then the company-wide roll-up. In 2024, we expect aerospace revenue of about $12 billion, up around 40% over 2023. Operating margin is expected to be up 130 basis points to 15%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 160, materially over the 111 delivered in 2023. This is about 10 fewer deliveries than we anticipated in the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of '22. The mix will include about 50 G700 deliveries and fewer G280s as a result of the Gaza conflict's impact on our Israel-based supplier. As I just noted, we anticipate a 15% operating margin for the year, weaker in the first half, particularly in the second quarter, and then well over 15% in the third and fourth quarters. While the ramp-up is slightly less than previously anticipated, it is not without supply chain challenges. In combat systems at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be flat in '23. With a changed threat environment, we had a 13% increase in revenue. For '24, we expect revenue to be up about 3% to $8.5 billion, coupled with a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin to 14.4%. The outlook is the result of the strong order activity we saw in '23 and the demand signals we see in Europe. To the extent that these demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue later in the year, particularly in our armaments and munitions business. As I noted earlier, the Marine group has been on a remarkable growth journey. In 2023, revenue came in much stronger than expected, almost $1.6 billion against a flattish forecast. Our outlook for this year anticipates revenue of about $12.8 billion, with operating margin improvement to 7.6%, which should result in a meaningful improvement in earnings in 2024. In technologies, 2023 revenue was stronger than anticipated in both businesses. 2024 revenue is expected to be up about 1% to $13 billion. Within the group, GDIT will be up low single digits, emissions systems will be down slightly due to a transition from legacy systems and a slow ramp up on new programs. Operating margins are expected to improve 20 basis points to about 9.5%. We see long term low single digit growth for the group and continued industry leading margins. So for 2024 company wide, we expect to see revenue of approximately $46.3 billion to $46.4 billion, an increase of around 9.5%. We anticipate operating margin of 11% up 100 basis points from 2023. All this rolls up to an EPS forecast of around $14.40. A reasonable range would be $14.35 billion to $14.45 billion. On a quarterly basis, the first two quarters look a lot alike with very strong third and fourth quarters. In summary, as we go into this year, we feel very good about the demand environment across all of our businesses. It has been some time since I have seen stronger demand signals and better promise of organic growth. We also have some very good opportunities across the business to improve operating margins. All we must do is execute. It almost goes without saying that we will be laser focused on operations. Nicole, back to you.
Nicole Shelton: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, I was hoping you could touch on the 700, not a surprise. How many do you have ready for pre-delivery inspection from your customers and also, relative to confidence of when the deliveries could take place, I mean, this is pretty much out of your control. The FAA has published a few rules last week that are pending and have to go through their process. I'm just curious, your confidence level for first quarter delivery versus, say, where you were in the fourth quarter expecting deliveries by year end? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So we have 15 airplanes ready to go and the hope is that we deliver them this quarter. The notifications that Gulfstream made earlier, I guess, this week, are in the regular order and really have no material impact on the certification process. I tried to give you as much clarity as I could around the certification and where we are.
Myles Walton: Is there an 800 delivery assumed in the guidance for '24?
Phebe Novakovic: So we're not going to go into what we've assumed for any given airplane in our guidance. So let me give you guys some perspective about this. For the last about eight years, we've tried to give you some clarity about a process over which we have no control and it's kind of like sticking your fingers in a light socket to predict a process that we just don't control. So I think we're going to be silent as we go forward about any specificity around certification timing because then we hear words like slip and miss and these planes are going to get certified, but get certified on the FAA schedule.
Myles Walton: All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to Ron Epstein at Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning, Phebe and Jason. Maybe just circling back on your remarks, Phebe, around EB, but maybe more broadly, just kind of the ship industrial base, the DOD has been making some big investments. Now, where do you see Virginia-class build rates ultimately getting, Columbia, too, because it just seems like the supply chain and maybe just also from just a capacity perspective, we're just under-capacitized. So, any thoughts on that?
Phebe Novakovic: So let's step back a minute and talk a little bit about the shipbuilding industrial base in general and the submarine industrial base in particular. These are very heavily manpower-driven businesses and industry and an entire supply chain and manpower availability was impacted significantly as a result of COVID in two respects. First, we had a really stunning increase in the timing and the number of retirements of seasoned workers throughout the industrial base. That, coupled with the post-COVID labor shortages, caused considerable perturbation in the supply chain. Those will begin to remedy. We've already seen some stabilization in the labor market. Those won't remedy, but there's clearly learning that has to happen throughout the supply chain. I'd say with respect to capacity, at Electric Boat, we are nicely sufficient capacity at the moment to deal with the demand that we have -- we see at the moment, but should that demand signal increase in the near term, we'll work closely with our Navy customer. I think key to the stabilization of the supply chain is improved delivery and improved quality and that happens as new workers come down their learning curves. We've benefited from Electric Boat because they have a very robust training system in which our new workers come out at a higher level of proficiency, but still they need to come down their learning curves and they're doing so nicely. I think to add a little bit of perspective to that, Electric Boat, we increased our velocity and throughput on Virginia by about 10% this year in '24% and about 30% on Columbia. So Electric Boat is continuing to do well. They just need to continue to improve their productivity, so we can continue to offset some of these financial impacts that we're seeing from the supply chain. But I would finally mention the Navy has been a very good partner in recognizing these challenges and working hard to get orders and certainty of demand into the supply chain and that helps the entire supply chain plan.
Ron Epstein: Got it. And maybe just one quick follow-on. Are we capacitized enough to meet the demand that AUKUS would require, having an extra Virginia class every three years?
Phebe Novakovic: So I think we're going to look at all of that with the Navy, but let me tell you, the best thing we can do for AUKUS in the moment is get back to two-a-year production. That's one step at a time.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jason Gursky at Citigroup.
Jason Gursky: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the G400 and how that plane seems to be performing from a market acceptance perspective and kind of the pipeline that you're seeing for that aircraft. I'm just kind of curious how that segment of your market is shaping up there as we come into the New Year.
Phebe Novakovic: So the plane is performing very nicely in excess of the design parameters. We see considerable interest in that end of the market and so we are quite positive about that airplane when it enters into service.
Jason Gursky: Okay, great. And then your comments on combat and the potential for some orders converting into revenue coming out of Europe in the second half of the year, that doesn't sound like it's implied in your guidance, but I'm just kind of curious that how far into the year can we go to get those orders and actually convert them into revenue?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, it depends on what the orders are for. On faster transaction material like service and munitions, they can move a little more quickly. Longer lead orders on combat vehicles take a little bit longer. So we factored to the best of our ability the known demand signals and the velocity of contracting into our plan. So the extent that there is upside, it'll be I think largely on the armament munition programs that execute at a faster rate and to the extent that we can speed up even further the installation of additional jigs and fixtures for productivity as well as our increased scope on delivery of munitions, that should help as well. But we think we had -- look in all cases, we give you a very balanced I'd say, 50-50 plan with opportunities and risks and we're quite comfortable with the estimates that we've given you at the time.
Operator: We'll go next to Davis Strauss at Barclays.
Davis Strauss: Phoebe, any thoughts on how the budget process for '24 might actually play out here given that we're quickly approaching, the potential for a sequester?
Phebe Novakovic: So we have factored in all known funding into our plan and should we see an extensive and continuing resolution, we'll have to see what impact that has on our faster transaction businesses because every CR plays out a bit differently and to the extent that we have a sequester then we have factored some of that, but apparently, clearly you can't do all of it into your plan. So we'll adjust accordingly, but we are hopeful that the Congress is able to pass a critical defense bill, particularly in these times given the threat environment.
Davis Strauss: Okay. Jason, I wanted to ask about free cash flow and capital deployment. Maybe help with some of the big movie pieces, obviously inventory was a big drag, but advances helped a lot. Your cash taxes have been really high. How do those all factor in, in '24 and I assume your guidance includes nothing as usual for capital deployment. How should we think about that given you have very little in maturities this year? Thanks.
Jason Aiken: Yeah, so when you think about free cash flow, we are anticipating to continue in the 100% conversion range in '24 and beyond. Obviously, we outperformed that a bit in 2023, but that doesn't affect what we expect in '24. So, the good news is a lot of the larger scale moving parts around cash flow are starting to settle down a little bit. We've experienced some big headwinds and then some corresponding tailwinds over the past several years, but right now if you look ahead, I think you can expect for the aerospace group a fairly steady conversion at or slightly above 100% conversion. When you think about it, we got a pretty big tailwind when they were building the significant backlog over the past few years and all the deposits were coming in. So that more than offset any effective inventory build. So as you transition into a period where you're starting to deliver off that inventory, but then you assume a steady one-to-one book-to-bill, you should be in a pretty regular burn rate at 100% conversion plus or minus for that business. Combat systems, on the other hand, should continue to see tailwinds as they work through some of the receivables and work in process on the international programs that we've made some great progress on in recent years. So that'll continue for a couple of years. The technologies group is a steady provider, well above 100% conversion and the marine systems group, as we noted, is still finishing up some of the large capital projects. We're coming through that now and we'll see what the future holds as Phebe alluded to in terms of Navy investment. But when you kind of net all those together, we're right about 100% for the coming year. If you look at capital deployment, as you noted, there's not a lot in terms of commitment. We've got $500 million in notes that mature out in November of this year. So we've got plenty of time to kind of see how things play out and decide what we want to do with that maturity. No rush on that decision and we'll look at all options as we always have. I think we've got great opportunity for stepped up share repurchases as more, I should say, as uncertainty sort of moves out of the environment. We looked at the last half of last year, the last quarter of last year, and the significant threat of a government shutdown sort of hung over the environment and that factors into our thinking as we think about how we preserve cash and deploy capital. So if we can get past that in March, then I think it provides a lot of optionality for us as we look ahead on the capital deployment front.
Phebe Novakovic: If you think about it, the demand signals we see and our expected growth make share repurchases increasingly compelling. Hey, one thing that Jason talked about, just mentioned tangentially, and I want to focus a little bit on and just give you guys some perspective, when we talk about a one-to-one book-to-bill in our businesses, that's really for planning purposes. It's not a forecast. So just keep that in mind.
Operator: We'll move next to Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Phebe, Jason. Thank you for the time. Phebe, great color on Gulfstream. You gave some numbers around the loss of revenues and profit that slipped into '24 from the G700, which would imply, north of 20% margins for the G700, and given you have quite a few built up already, any color you could give on profit profile of the G700 relative to maybe the G650 and the G500 and 600?
Phebe Novakovic: Hey, can you repeat the last part of your question? It was kind of coming in.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Sure, sorry. It was more just the profit profile of the G700 relative to G650 and the G500 and G600 as it entered service, just because you gave the revenue.
Phebe Novakovic: Yeah, the G700 comes in at accretive margins, but as you all know, and many of you are quite expert in this, we've talked about over the years, including on this call, the margin performance at Gulfstream is driven by a host of issues and as I noted in my remarks, mix, pricing, out of station work, all impacted. So I think, again, as I mentioned earlier, the way to think about our plan is a really balanced plan. Not quite the question you asked, but I'd stick with that and I'd think about it that way. But these new airplanes are coming in at very nice margins.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, and then if I could ask one more on the defense side of the business, just given a lot of what your peers are talking about as well, and you have pretty robust demand in Marine and combat, but earnings growth tends to be below revenue growth. So just given inflation and mix, how do you think about GD's ability to continue to grow defense profits? It seems like combat is seeing some of that.
Phebe Novakovic: Combat is seeing some of it, but I tried to give you some perspective earlier on the impacts of what happened to the industrial base in the Marine group, and it also impacted Gulfstream as a result of COVID. So for us, it's really a question of operating excellence, operating excellence, operating excellence. We're going to focus on that very heavily. So we drive increased profitable growth. That's the value proposition that we're looking at right now.
Operator: We'll move next to Seth Seifman at JP Morgan.
Seth Seifman: Okay, thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to start off asking about combat and just the 3% growth guide. I guess even if we adjust for some seasonality, I might have thought that the activity levels that we're seeing here in the earlier, what we saw in the second half of '23 would lead to some really quite robust growth in the first half, perhaps even double digit, and then being at 3% would imply something like flat or down in the second half. Am I not thinking about that cadence properly, or is there some reason for the growth to really step off or come down in the second half?
Phebe Novakovic: No, I wouldn't look at anything macro with respect to that. In a quickly growing environment, contracts tend to come in a little bit more lumpier, and so this is simply a question of timing. I think we see mid to upper single digits over and toward the higher upper single digits over our planned period, but we've given you the plan that given the faster execution of contracting that we saw last year, we may have a bit of a slowdown in the first couple quarters and then acceleration as the year goes on, but the demand is there.
Seth Seifman: Sure, sure. Okay, excellent. And then on aerospace, I guess it's probably about two years ago that you gave us a multi-year look at the aerospace business and the expectations there as the demand started to gather. Since that bunch of stuff has happened, I think demand has probably been a little stronger than expected. We've also seen some supply chain issues, some certification pushouts. As we think about a multi-year outlook for aerospace in terms of deliveries and profitability, is that something you can update at this time?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, so we're going to deliver 160 airplanes that's in our plan this year. I will say that '25 will be more deliveries and '26 even more deliveries, but at this point given the issues that you mentioned, we're not going to be any more granular than that. We owe you additional fidelity as time goes on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everyone. Phebe, maybe just following on that, but a little bit bigger picture, I was curious to hear you talk about how you're managing supply versus demand in this pretty unique business jet market because if you go to $12 billion in revenue, that's run rating $3 billion a quarter and based on the change in backlog, I know that's imperfect, but directionally, the order rate had made it to $3 billion a quarter, but it's now slowed a little bit and we're trying to figure out where this market settles out. And so you want to get customers airplanes and you want to grow, but I know you also want to maintain backlog and that you're more focused on pricing and margins than units and so if you're going to $12 billion and then as you just said to Seth, you're going to go higher, I guess you'd be burning backlog. So how do you think about managing that multi-year supply versus demand in that market?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, look, I don't see us particularly burning through backlog given the robust backlog we have and given the robust pipeline that we have. We're off to a good start this year. So I don't see anything that particularly drives an unhealthy burn through the backlog. We have believed for some time and it is turning out to be the case that new clean sheet airplanes drive incremental demand and we're certainly seeing that and we don't see much of an abatement in that.
Noah Poponak: Okay. So it sounds like you potentially expect the quarterly order rate to pick back up moving forward as your new airplanes are more entrenched in the market?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, look, our order rate has been quite healthy and quite wholesome and we would expect additional orders supported by the pipeline to come in this year. So we're not going to give you any real granularity around orders per quarter, but we see nice demand, continuing interest, and a very solid pipeline. To me, those are the sort of foundational elements that we rely on for looking on a going forward basis, looking at what production can ultimately be.
Operator: We'll move next to Cai von Rumohr at TD Cowen.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much, Phebe. Good, good numbers. So Gulfstream, two issues. First, you mentioned the Hamas attack and the impact on the G280. Maybe tell me the status of that and what that means in terms of your ability to get deliveries. And secondly, I think the bigger question is, by my quick math, it looks like your guidance for '24 implies an 18% incremental margin at Gulfstream, which seems low given the good margins you should be getting on the G700.
Phebe Novakovic: Okay. Right. So look, let's agree that we shouldn't in any given moment infer something from an implied margin. I think as you know probably better than most that the margin performance in any given quarter is driven by a myriad of factors that we have gone over multiple, multiple times and I think in this environment where we are encouraged by the supply chain, but we've got more ways to go, we think that we have given you a very, very balanced plan and I really stick to that plan. That's how I think about it. With respect to the G280, we have properly adjusted our plan to deal with the realities of what they are facing there. They are continuing to perform with retirees and management and as I say, we factored all of that into our expectations for the year.
Cai von Rumohr: So is that, I still don't quite understand, the 18% margin, is that sort of a P&L drag, the fact that there's -- they can't get enough or the timing?
Phebe Novakovic: I wouldn't say it's a P&L drag. It's just a reality of the multiplicity of factors that are impacting us. '24 is a pivotal year. We saw a significant improvement in the supply chain during the course of the year that frankly allowed us to increase production in the latter half of the year. If you recall, we were delivering between 24 aircraft and 25 aircraft and we delivered 39 aircraft in the fourth quarter. That makes us pretty optimistic that we can continue to increase production, but we are cautious about the ability of the supply chain to keep up. All indicators are that they're doing quite well, but this is one step at a time and there's more risk. As I say, we're optimistic, but we've got a ways to go.
Operator: We'll move next to George Shapiro at Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Just following up a bit on Cai's question, the incremental margin was like 38% here in this fourth quarter, which is pretty extraordinary. So, what changes to really knock that down to the point that Cai's comment?
Phebe Novakovic: Hey, you guys are reverse engineering incremental margin and it's almost impossible to deal with in the complexity of this business. I would infer nothing from it. Look, let's talk about the underlying capabilities. Gulfstream has a lot of operating leverage. They've always been a good since we acquired them at GD years ago. They have been strong operating performers, with very good margin performance and gross margins coming out of their operations. That won't change, but the mix of business, the level of any given quarters, timing around supply chain and its impact on out-of-station work and mix of service, jet aviation, all of those things are contributing. So, there is nothing systemic other than those issues that you know, and they are temporary and we will work through the supply chain issues, but there's nothing systemic that should concern you about where we stand on Gulfstream and its ability to increase margins, earnings and revenue over time here.
George Shapiro: And one for you, Jason. The unbilled receivables were down like $450 million in the quarter. Is that just Ajax catching up?
Jason Aiken: It's a little bit Ajax and it's a little bit of the ongoing payments on our other large international program of combat systems. Those are the two big pieces. Yes, George.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Robert Spingarn at Melius Research.
Robert Spingarn: Phoebe, Phebe the marine guide implies about $340 million in sales growth and in the past, you've talked about Columbia driving $400 million to $500 million of growth per year. So, could an economic price adjustment for Virginia-class be a meaningful source of sales and operating income for Marine in 2024?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, EPA adjustments can always be a good source of income. Look, I think the way that we've always talked about Marine growth being somewhat lumpy, $300 million to $500 million in any given year, but in the next two years, we expect between $600 million and $1 billion in per annum growth. So the growth is there. It just comes in on a lumpier basis than one might want, but it is there. So with respect to Virginia and any EPA adjustments, we're continuing to work with the Navy. We had contemplated the impact of Columbia prioritization, as had the Navy, on Virginia and that's just a work in progress as we work through all the particulars with the Navy, but we think we've given you a pretty good indicator of this year's revenue and we'll adjust it accordingly if anything changes on the upside.
Robert Spingarn: So just to be clear, there's nothing in there for an adjustment yet?
Phebe Novakovic: No. I think it's premature to put numbers in before you've got an agreement with your customers.
Robert Spingarn: Fair enough. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: And Audra, I think we have time for just one more question.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take that question from Peter Arment at Baird.
Peter Arment: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Hey, Phebe, maybe just to add and just speak on Marine, you've given us a lot of details on what some of the pressures were, but we've seen throughout the industry, the Defense Production Act has been used to kind of improve some capacity at rocket motors and munitions. Is there an opportunity? I know the Navy's a really good partner and customer. Is there an opportunity for to get some relief and free up some additional resources for you at the yards?
Phebe Novakovic: So we have been pretty well resourced by the Navy and for many, many years in anticipation of particularly the Columbia and Block 5. So I think from our perspective where we really need some assistance and continued assistance from the Navy is stabilization of on-time delivery and quality coming out of the out of the supply chain. So I think that as we go through this year, I'm sure there'll be additional opportunities for us to work with the Navy and find some ability to relieve those pain points that remain in the supply chain.
Peter Arment: Appreciate the color. Thanks, Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Hey, and listen, before we leave, I just wanted, this is for many of you may know, this is Jason's last earnings call, and I wanted to thank him for his excellent years of service as a CFO. He will be missed, but his work will continue at Technologies. So I'm sure all of you will join me in congratulating Jason on a superb CFO job well done over the years.
Nicole Shelton: Okay. Well, thank you all for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the fourth quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Please go ahead.
Nicole Shelton: Thank you Operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings.  We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer, and Bill Moss, Vice President and Controller. With the introductions complete, I’ll turn the call over to Jason.
Jason Aiken: Thank you Nicole. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. The first thing I’ll note is that our Chairman and CEO, Phebe Novakovic, is under the weather today, so I’ll be conducting today’s call along with Bill.  Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.04 per diluted share on revenue of $10.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.06 billion and net income of $836 million. Revenue was up $596 million or 6% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $41 million or 3.7%. Net earnings were down $66 million and earnings per share were down 6.7%. The quarter-over-quarter results show significant growth in revenue but a 100 basis point contraction in operating margin. On the other hand, sequential results are quite good across the board. Here, we beat last quarter’s revenue by 4.1%, operating earnings by 9.9%, net earnings by 12.4%, and EPS by 12.6%. From a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.13 per share on higher revenue and better operating earnings than anticipated. Operating margin is about the same as expected. The beat came almost entirely from operations. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up 7.2%, operating earnings were down less than 1%, and diluted earnings per share were down 2.6%. We had another very strong quarter from a cash perspective. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $1.32 billion and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, which is 131% of net earnings. This follows very good cash performance in the first half. Order performance was good in the quarter in all segments and particularly strong at Gulfstream and the marine segment. You’ll hear more detail on cash and backlog, as well as some of the other financial particulars from Bill in just a minute. In short, we enjoyed a strong quarter, particularly so in light of the supply chain and program mix headwinds that time will cure, so let me move right ahead with some color around the performance of the business segments. First, aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $2.03 billion and operating earnings of $268 million with a 13.2% operating margin. Revenue was down $315 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by fewer deliveries at Gulfstream due to supply chain constraints. Operating earnings were down $44 million on lower revenue and a 10 basis point contraction in margin. The sequential comparison is much better - revenue was up $79 million or 4%, and operating earnings were up $32 million or 13.6% on 110 basis point improvement in margin. There were 27 deliveries in the quarter, three more than in the second quarter. To provide some additional color here, Gulfstream has made 72 aircraft deliveries through the end of the quarter. We are on track to deliver between 40 and 45 currently in-service aircraft in the fourth quarter. All-in including G700s, we anticipate in excess of 60 deliveries in the quarter, assuming we’re granted FAA certification before the end of the year. That said, as you can tell, there’s a considerable amount of uncertainty as we get closer to certification. Moving to the demand environment, this was yet another positive quarter reflecting continuing strong demand. Aerospace book-to-bill was 1.4 to 1, and Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.5 to 1. We continue to have vibrant sales activity going into the fourth quarter and expect strong orders. It would, however, be a stretch to get to 1 to 1 in the fourth quarter, given our expectation of over 60 deliveries. A wildcard in the quarter will be the conflict in Israel and its impact on demand, if any. The period of significant increased aircraft demand began in mid-February of 2021, over two and a half years ago. In 2021, Gulfstream’s book-to-bill was 1.7 to 1, in ’22 it was 1.5 to 1, and year-to-date 2023 it’s 1.3 to 1. This includes the first quarter of 2023, when there was a three-week hiatus in orders as a result of the failure of several regional banks. In that quarter, we still managed a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill.  All of this leads quite naturally to an astonishing build of the aerospace backlog. It grew from $11.6 billion at the end of 2020 to $20.1 billion at the end of the third quarter 2023, an increase of over 70% in two and three-quarter years. This all speaks to me of the underlying strength of the market for our products. The G700 flight test and certification program continues to move closer to its ultimate conclusion. We continue to plan for certification in the fourth quarter of this year, largely dependent upon the availability of FAA resources and a credit the FAA may allow for company flying. We currently are spending most of our engineering time on final reports and data submission. Operationally, Gulfstream continues to make good progress under difficult circumstances, but as a result of the supply chain issues that we’ve previously discussed, we plan to deliver 10 to 12 fewer aircraft this year than the 145 we had originally forecast in the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we continue to expect more service revenue than initially predicted. Next, combat systems. Combat systems had revenue of $2.22 billion, up a stunning 24.4% over the year-ago quarter with growth at each of the business units, but particularly at OTS and European land systems. Earnings were $300 million, which was up 10.7%. Margins at 13.5% represent 170 basis point reduction versus the year-ago quarter, so once again we saw powerful revenue performance coupled with more modest operating margins in large part attributable to mix and new program starts. Some of our revenue increase is a result of facilities contracts to increase our artillery production capacity taken at lower margin. As you’d expect, these contracts will result in additional production at accretive margins over time. On the subject of munitions, we’re working very closely with our government customer and have accelerated production faster than planned. The large capacity expansion that we’re putting in place today will further increase production. We have a ways to go, but we’re making progress. The increase in combat revenue also came from new international vehicle programs, the ramp-up of the M10 Booker, higher artillery program volume, and higher volume on Piranha and Eagle vehicles in Europe. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $300 million or 15.6%, and earnings were up $49 million or 19.5% on a 50 basis point improvement in margin. Year-to-date, revenue was up $775 million or 15.1% and operating earnings were up $53 million or 7.1% over last year, so the numbers are quite impressive quarter-over-quarter, sequentially and year-to-date. Combat systems experienced very good order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in a one-to-one book-to-bill, a very strong performance given the increased revenue and evidencing strong demand for munitions and international combat vehicles. Year-to-date, the book-to-bill is 1.3 to 1, which fully supports the growth outlook. Turning to marine systems, once again our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine systems revenue of $3 billion was up $233 million or 8.4% against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering drove the growth. Operating earnings were $211 million, down $27 million versus the year-ago quarter with 160 basis point decrement in operating margin. The year-ago quarter had a number of favorable EAC adjustments which did not repeat this quarter. Sequentially, both revenue and operating earnings were down somewhat. Importantly, year-to-date revenue was up $982 million, 12.2%; however, earnings were essentially flat on a 90 basis point contraction in operating margin.  The real driver of the margin difficulty has been the late deliveries at Electric Boat from the supply chain, which causes out-of-station work and internal scheduling disruptions. Electric Boat has continued to improve its throughput, but not fast enough to offset the cost of late material. We continue with the help of the Navy to work this issue. At Bath, while we’re seeing signs of improved productivity, it has yet to manifest in the business’ financial performance. All that said, we’re looking for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time. Importantly, marine systems enjoyed a very good quarter from an orders perspective with a 2.3 to 1 book-to-bill. This is a very large enduring backlog. Lastly, technologies. It was another strong quarter with revenue of $3.3 billion, which is up 8% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong first half of the year. That growth was spread pretty evenly between GDIT and mission systems; in fact, each business grew both year-over-year and sequentially. At GDIT, we’re seeing particular strength in the defense and federal civilian portfolios as our technology accelerator investments and capabilities like zero trust, artificial intelligence, digital engineering and 5G are really resonating with customers and driving increased demand.  At mission systems, the cyber and naval platform markets have been particularly strong. The production and delivery cadence on the hardware side appears to have stabilized, so we expect their results to be somewhat more predictable despite the lingering fragility in the supply chain that will continue to be the new normal. Based on the strength of the first three quarters, the group is on track to achieve our increased sales forecast of $12.7 billion for the year. Operating earnings in the quarter were $315 million, up 10.5%, yielding a margin of 9.5% - that’s up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 70 basis points sequentially, so a very solid performance on strong revenue growth in the quarter. This is a drumbeat we expect to see continue in the fourth quarter. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $12.7 billion. Through the first nine months, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1 to 1, keeping pace with the strong revenue growth across the business. Prospects remain strong with a qualified funnel of over $125 billion in opportunities they’re pursuing across the portfolio. Let me close with a review of the defense units in aggregate. As a whole on a quarter-over-quarter basis, defense had revenue of $8.54 billion, up $911 million or 11.9% over the year-ago quarter. On the same basis, earnings of $826 million were up $32 million or 4%. On a sequential basis, the pattern is similar - revenue was up $340 million or 4.1% and earnings were up $57 million or 7.4%. Year-to-date against the same period last year, revenue of $24.7 billion was up 10.2% and operating earnings were up $60 million or 2.6%. In short, our defense businesses are experiencing significant growth in revenue and to a lesser degree in earnings; however, we need to continue to work with our supply chain in order to achieve appropriate operating leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Bill.
Bill Moss: Thank you Jason, and good morning. We had another very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 to 1 for the company. This is particularly impressive with the strong revenue growth in the quarter. Marine systems and aerospace led the way with book-to-bill ratios of 2.3 and 1.4 respectively. For the second quarter in a row, this led to record level backlog of $95.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up 4.6% from last quarter and up 7.6% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter just shy of $133 billion. Moving to our cash performance, this was another strong story in the quarter with over $1.3 billion of operating cash flow. This brings us to $3.5 billion of operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.1 billion for the quarter and $2.9 billion year-to-date, or 126% of net income through the first nine months. This conversion rate was achieved on the strength of the Gulfstream orders, additional scheduled progress payment on combat systems international programs, and continued strong cash performance in technologies. We are well positioned to achieve our target for the year of a cash conversion rate over 100% of net income. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures were $227 million in the quarter, or 2.1% of sales. For the first nine months, we’re at 2% of sales. We’re still targeting to be slightly below 2.5% of sales for the full year, so that implies an uptick in capital investments in the fourth quarter. We paid $363 million in dividends and repurchased a little over a quarter million shares during the quarter, bringing the total deployed in dividends and share repurchases through the first nine months to $1.5 billion. We also repaid $500 million of debt that matured in August and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.3 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $7.9 billion, down nearly $1.4 billion from year end. Net interest expense in the quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $265 million, down from $279 million for the same period in 2022.  Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 15.6%, bringing the rate for the first nine months to 16.2%. This is consistent with our guidance last quarter to expect a lower rate in the third quarter and a higher rate in the fourth, so no change to our outlook of 17% for the full year, which again implies a higher tax rate in the discrete fourth quarter. Now let me turn it back to Jason for some final remarks.
Jason Aiken: Thanks Bill. As far as year-end guidance is concerned, we’re holding at $12.65 for the year. There will be a number of puts and takes from what we published last quarter, but it should all come about the same place. Nicole, that will conclude our remarks, so I’ll turn the call back to you.
Nicole Shelton: Thanks Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate.  Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Yes, thank you. [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.
Peter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Jason and Bill. Jason, it sounds like there’s just obviously a lot of moving parts for Q4 at Gulfstream. Is there a cut-off date, you know, if certification happens in December versus November, about your ability to kind of push out those deliveries, and then any commentary on just--I know you’ve had a long term forecast of 170 deliveries for ’24, whether you still think that holds. Obviously if certification slips, there would be more potentially, but maybe just some commentary there. Thanks.
Jason Aiken: Yes, thanks Peter. As it relates to certification, I think what we’ve said for some time now is that if we can achieve certification in the, call it early to mid December time frame, then we’ve got a good shot at getting the planned deliveries of G700s out the door this year. Obviously if that pushes further to the right, that puts that a little bit at risk. To your point about 2024, it’s probably not appropriate to get into specifics about next year until we go through our plan period, which we’ll engage in coming up here in the next month or two, but I think the way to think about this is a lot of what we’ve been talking about this year between the supply chain challenges, as well as the G700 cert timing, is really timing issues, and to your point, to the extent some of the deliveries that we anticipated this year don’t happen, that really just pushes into next year, so that naturally is an adder to the outlook for 2024.  But what we can’t do yet is declare victory on the supply chain issues and say that by early next year, they’re going to be completely solved, so a lot remains to be seen as to the timing of how that ultimately works itself out. I think it’s that that will determine the net impact to 2024, so I think a little bit more time is going to be needed to see between what pushes out of 2023 into 2024 and the timing of the supply chain fix, what the net impact is to that ’24 outlook. I think we’ll have a better sense of that when we come back to you with guidance in January.
Peter Arment: Appreciate the color, thanks Jason.
Operator: We will take our next question from David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open.
David Strauss: Thanks, good morning.
Jason Aiken: Good morning David.
David Strauss: Hey. Jason, at the beginning of the year, you guys had forecasted marine and combat to be relatively flat. At this point, we’re looking at probably double-digit growth for both of those businesses this year. Does any of that--as we start thinking about how those businesses could look next year, does any of this represent any sort of pull-forward that would potentially moderate the growth that we could see out of those two businesses next year?
Jason Aiken: Yes, so I think as it relates to marine systems, David, nothing has really fundamentally changed from the narrative that we’ve talked about for some time, which is to expect roughly $400 million to $500 million on average per year, year-over-year growth in that business. Obviously this year has turned out to be quite a bit different than we originally anticipated, and that’s largely attributable to the increased throughput that we’ve seen at Electric Boat in particular as the hiring and retention dynamics have really improved faster than we thought, so that’s really driven a lot of the revenue acceleration into this year. That backlog is so large and so long term, I don’t really see that having a direct effect on next year or any given year, but obviously again we’ll have to go through the specific planning period that we’re about to engage in before we get too specific about next year, so we’ll be back with more on that, but not a direct correlation in my mind from that marine systems increase in throughput. On combat systems, to your point, we had been expecting sort of flat to down-ish revenue before the threat environment really took a turn in the opposite direction, and as you’ve seen through the first part of the year, up 15% so far year-to-date, almost 25% in the quarter - that certainly was well beyond what our original expectations were, and frankly we don’t see that demand signal slowing down. When you think about the munitions side of the business as well as the international demand we’re seeing, along with the new program starts in the U.S., I don’t necessarily see that as being a pull forward or something that creates a headwind into 2024. Again, not being specific about that outlook because we’ll get into the planning period and get back to you in January.
David Strauss: As a follow-up, the IRS came out with updated guidance on Section 174 R&D. What impact does that have on your cash flow outlook?
Jason Aiken: Really, nothing other than what we’ve told you before. We’ve actually been pretty consistent on this throughout the drama on this issue over the years. We didn’t originally anticipate the law to be changed, so our guidance was predicated on the law as it is. It turned out not to be changed, and our expectation of what that would mean for us, ultimately you can call it lucky or good, we expected the net impact from a cash perspective to be right on course with what we’re seeing right now.
Operator: We will take our next question from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Ken Herbert: Yes, hi. Good morning, Jason and Bill. Maybe just to start, Jason, again on Gulfstream. Last quarter, you called out sort of 19 as the expected 700 delivery number, depending upon cert timing this year. Is that still a number we should expect into the fourth quarter, assuming you get certification in time, and can you just comment on any potential risk around 280 production levels, considering some of the uncertainty in the Middle East?
Jason Aiken: Yes, so far as the G700 is concerned, 19 is the number that we have targeted and are still striving to get to. Again, as you note, that is predicated on timing of cert. What I can tell you in terms of a little bit of color behind that is we’ve got 15 of those 19 that are ready to go and are in good shape, and we’re working toward the others, so again predicated on when the cert comes, we should be in good shape to be somewhere in that range for deliveries this year. As it relates to the 280s, what I would tell you is the modest down-tick that we--that I talked about earlier this morning in terms of our overall 2024--excuse me, 2023 deliveries, that five or six aircraft reduction from our previous guidance in July, that is largely related to G280s. I would tell you that what we planned to deliver this year, we now have in hand at our Dallas facility for completion, so there’s really not any incremental risk to 2023. We will have to see, obviously, how the events in Israel play out and what impact that may have in 2024, but a little premature to get into that at this point.
Ken Herbert: Okay, great. Thanks Jason.
Jason Aiken: You’re welcome.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Robert Stallard: Thanks very much, good morning. 
Jason Aiken: Morning Rob.
Robert Stallard: Jason, on the supply chain, maybe I’m just reading too much into this, it sounds as if it actually got a bit worse than what you talked about last quarter, so I wonder if you can elaborate on what you’ve been seeing, whether there are any specific pinch points that are causing you trouble.
Jason Aiken: Rob, I’m going to guess you’re talking about supply chain in aerospace, and if so, I would tell you that actually we’re seeing modest signs throughout the quarter that things are actually getting better. It’s not, as you’d imagine, a straight line to the finish line on this issue, so there will be some bumps in the road and some curves along the way, but things are starting to trend better. What we saw here was a specific issue in terms of, as I mentioned, G280s in terms of the reduced in-service aircraft production, but on the large cabin aircraft, we are starting to see things trend in the right direction, so I think it’s a little bit maybe in the other direction of what your intuition is pointing you to.
Robert Stallard: Okay, good to hear. Just as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could elaborate on where you stand on supply chain in, I think, mission systems had a few issues, and also in the labor situation at marine, that that seems to have improved.
Jason Aiken: Sorry, it broke up there, Rob, at the end. You said mission systems supply chain and then labor--?
Robert Stallard: At marine.
Jason Aiken: Oh, labor at marine - okay. On the mission systems side, I feel very good about what they’ve done. The supply chain, to be completely candid with you, remains, and I think we expect it to remain what I’d call fragile. I don’t think that that’s going to get back to what we saw pre-pandemic for the foreseeable future, but the fact is the team at mission systems has fully incorporated that new reality into their outlook, and so I expect their future to be a lot more stable and predictable as they’ve incorporated the new normal, if you will, on supply chain on the electronic side for them. In terms of the labor side on marine systems, as I mentioned earlier, I think we’ve seen stabilization in both attraction and retention of labor in the shipyards at a faster rate than we anticipated, so that’s an encouraging sign. That drives the throughput in the yard, and over time as those new shipbuilders become more tenured, more experienced, more proficient, we would expect at that point, that’s one of the factors that will really drive over time the margin improvement in the shipyard, so it’s an encouraging start for them. We’ve just got to see that play out, because as you know, shipbuilding is a long term venture.
Operator: We will take our next question from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Scott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.
Jason Aiken: Morning.
Scott Deuschle: Jason, can you walk through some of the high level puts and takes for aerospace incremental margins next year, and I guess maybe to ask another way, are the right things to focus on from our perspective the G700 mix, less out-of-sequence work, the learning curve on G700, and then presumably R&D either leveling off or coming down, or is there anything else here that we should be considering? Thank you.
Jason Aiken: I’d say you nailed most of the high level items there for next year, and again the G700 is a bit piece of it. Obviously we’ve talked about how that will come into service with favorable entry level margins, accretive entry level margins for the group, so that’s a big driver. I think the other major one, and you alluded to it, really is the resolution and straightening out of the supply chain issues. One of the things Gulfstream has really worked towards here and planned towards, I think very effectively and we’ll see it over time, is driving the efficiency of the operation with this new family of aircraft. Between the facilities that have been built, the commonality between the airplanes, the ability to service those airplanes efficiently, that is really what we are driving towards and one of the major underpinnings behind the long term trajectory back to the mid to high teens margins for that group. Obviously timing of when those things get straightened out in the supply chain will be important, because that’s really what’s sort of inhibiting us getting to that point of efficiency.  We will see a little bit of modest down-tick in R&D - I wouldn’t call that a major factor, but you should expect to see that tick down a little as we finish up the 700 this year and get through the 800 next year, but again, have 800 and 400 to go, so we’re not out of things yet from an R&D standpoint there. Those are the major puts and takes, I’d say. All in all, we would expect to see revenue--or excuse me, margin continuing on its trajectory again toward that mid to high teens rate. We’ll see improvement here in the fourth quarter, and I expect to see good improvement in 2024.
Scott Deuschle: Okay, great. Then as a follow-up, are there any major company-funded growth capex projects still underway in ’24 and ’25, or is most of that complete this year? If it does complete this year, does the nearly billion dollars of capex included in current Bloomberg incentives for ’24 and ’25 make directional sense, because that’s basically still in line with ’23, I think? Thank you.
Jason Aiken: Yes, the major internal capex projects are done this year. We’ve got a little bit of trailing cost and activity going on in the shipyards as we finish out that capacity expansion, particularly at Electric Boat, but that will wrap up next year. The investments we’re making on the Army side from an artillery perspective, that’s being funded by the customer, and so bottom line, we ought to see our capex level trend back towards 2%. We’ll be below 2.5% this year, which is directionally headed the right way, and we’ll be back toward--if not at 2%, headed toward 2% next year.
Operator: We will take our next question from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kristine Liwag: Hey, good morning Jason and Bill. Maybe first on the president’s $106 billion supplemental request, it includes $3.4 billion for the submarine industrial base. With this request out there now and with respect to AUKUS, can you talk more about what this means for GD? Does this change timing at all?
Jason Aiken: Bottom line, Kristine, I think the short answer is no. Obviously any additional support that can be provided in terms of that supplemental or other funding to shore up the industrial base is helpful. There’s a lot of talk around AUKUS and obviously we’re going to do everything we can to support our customer in that regard, but the fact is this supply chain still remains very fragile.  We’ve got a lot of work to do to get this whole industry back to--from a submarine perspective, back to two per year. We’ve got to get to that point on Virginia while delivering Columbias, and I think we’ve got some more work to do to get there, and so any additional funding and support, whether it’s through the supplemental or other Navy support, would be extremely helpful, but that’s our focus today, is to get to that two per year plus Columbia, and then we’ll look to AUKUS beyond that.
Kristine Liwag: Following up on your comments on the fragile supply chain, has there been changes in your contracting terms with the customer to reflect this, and how do we think about long term margins?
Jason Aiken: I think the main way this has been reflected in our contracting with the customer is to recognize the impacts that we’ve had and to price that in, and accommodate what is this current state of affairs in our contracting. One example of that is the DDG multi-year that we just saw awarded in the quarter - we feel like that’s been appropriately considered there, and we’ll continue to consider the state that the industry is in as we go forward. I wouldn’t point to necessarily any other macro or overarching contract structures or other terms that have changed. In terms of margins, we expect them to get better, frankly. My expectation is that this quarter would be the trough for the group. We expect to see improvement in the fourth quarter and we expect to see modest sequential incremental improvement over time in this group. That said, this is a challenging task. Shipbuilding is a challenging endeavor and so it’s not going to be straightforward, but our expectation, to be completely straightforward, is to have gradual increasing margins in this group over time as we march back toward that 8% to 9%-plus margin range.
Operator: We will take our next question from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Seth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much, and good morning everyone. Maybe just a follow-up on that last topic. The Q3 margin in marine, similar to Q1. In Q1, we know there were some charges on Virginia, I believe Block 4 and Block 5. Were there significant negative EACs on Virginia in the third quarter that drove the margin that we ended up seeing, and I guess any--I know you talked about supply chain at Electric Boat, but any additional color about what assumptions have really changed there, and with the new assumptions, how that affects your ability to expand margins?
Jason Aiken: In the quarter, Seth, nothing material in terms of EACs in the quarter. What you’re seeing there, obviously we are still experiencing pressure from delayed material coming out of the supply chain that’s affecting Electric Boat’s schedule and delivery and man hour in the yard. But the other implication that you’re seeing is having reduced the margin rates through the earlier EAC adjustments, we’re now seeing the aggregate impact of that in the booking rates that we are recognizing on the programs today, so it’s sort of the aggregate confluence of all those factors are driving the margin rate that you see in the quarter. But again, as we start to continue to improve the throughput and improve the efficiency in the yards, we do expect to see incremental improvement in the margin, starting in the fourth quarter. In terms of supply chain changes, I don’t know that it’s anything changing. I think it’s as we go to contract, we have 2020 hindsight, or full visibility if you will, into the current state of affairs, and so we’re working through that with our customer and they understand the situation we’re in, so we’re basically incorporating the current state of the supply chain, as well as the implications of increasing cost of skilled labor as you’ve seen with a lot of the labor negotiations going on out in the market. It’s those types of factors that are being incorporated, that we’re putting into the new contracts and that we feel like will put us in a good position to perform from a margin perspective as we look ahead.
Seth Seifman: Okay, okay, thanks. Then just for clarification, when you talked about at the overall company and despite some changes, the EPS outlook being unchanged, was that sort of--that was based on that new Gulfstream delivery outlook that you talked about with the 60-plus in Q4. If the G700 wasn’t to be certified this year, I assume that that’s kind of a different story, and what’s the last date roughly that you could see that certification happen and still deliver, I don’t know, double-digit G700s?
Jason Aiken: Yes, so the EPS reaffirmed at $12.65 is based on the updated Gulfstream delivery number that I mentioned earlier. As I said, that’s mostly--the reduced number from the July outlook is mostly associated with G280s, so not as significant an earnings impact to that. As you can imagine, some puts and takes, none of which are particularly material, across the rest of the portfolio, including some upward pressure across the defense businesses from a revenue perspective, as you might imagine, improved, customer service revenue at the aerospace group and so on, some below-the-line things like lower interest expense and share count, net-net kind of putting us in the same place, so that’s sort of why the guidance stays where it is. In terms of the 700 outlook, I think the key issue is, and the question so many people around why the uncertainty, is we don’t have a date certain. This is the FAA’s process. We need to let them go through that process. We are supporting them in that process. They’re going through flying now and we’re doing the necessary paperwork and reporting to support that, and so we have a path, we have an expectation to get there in early to mid-December, but there’s not a red line or a date certain on the calendar that we’re looking at, at this point.
Operator: We will take our next question from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Doug Harned: Good morning, thank you.
Jason Aiken: Morning Doug.
Doug Harned: I wanted to go back to marine because when you look at Electric Boat, and your backlogs have been--have built way up, as you mentioned, the Navy wants to be at two VCS deliveries per year, can you describe, like, what scenarios you can even look at here? I mean, my understand it’s about 1.2 now, it’s way off what clearly Congress wants, what the Navy wants. Are there scenarios that you think about in terms of how soon in a good situation we might get to that two per year, or what would be a negative scenario? What’s the range of outcomes here?
Jason Aiken: No, you point out the landscape appropriately, Doug. I think the way I think about that is prior to COVID, if you look at the couple quarters leading up to 2020, we were--as a team, we were right on the threshold of getting to two per year on the Virginia-class program, so it is imminently doable in terms of the industrial base and the team that’s working that program. Obviously COVID set us on our heels, as well as the generational changeover in shipbuilders in terms of retirements and new hires. I think the way to think about that now is there’s a number of factors that are going to help us get back to that point. One is, again, the maturing and tenuring of that new workforce to get the efficiency in the workforce, to get us back to where we were. The investments that the Navy is making in the industrial base, which are extremely helpful to stabilize that, and then other initiatives like what we call strategic sourcing, where we’re trying to take bottlenecks out of the shipyards and move subsystem construction and capacity into other facilities and other yards around the country, so that we can take some of the pressure off of the two main production and assembly yards. Those are the types of things that are going to drive us back toward two per year. I’d be remiss to try and give you a timeline on when it’s going to be to get there - this is long term, challenging stuff, but I think with us and our partner and the Navy all working in the same direction and in a very strong partnership, I feel optimistic about our path to get there.
Doug Harned: Then as a follow-up, if you add one more factor into this, which is Columbia class, obviously in a very different stage in the program, but also you’ve got an overlapping supply chain. How does progress on the Columbia class right now look, and how does that affect your ability to push forward on this VCS ramp?
Jason Aiken: Yes, Columbia, as you know, is the Navy’s and the DoD’s number one priority, so that’s going to continue to be the case. I don’t see that being a trade-off necessarily to get to two per year for Virginia. Right now, we’re a little over 40% complete on the first boat, and we’re right on schedule for the targeted completion of that first boat. We’ve still got obviously about four years to go before delivery, so a lot of the way to go and a lot can happen between now and then, but all the resources that can be brought to bear are on that priority. I think the way to think about it is because of its priority position, it is essentially a headwind to those other factors that I gave you about what we’re trying to do on Virginia class, and we’ve got to be able to manage both of those within the yard and within the team arrangement and with our customer, but those are some of the puts and takes. Columbia will be the priority, and it’s our job to make Virginia happen notwithstanding that priority.
Operator: We will take our next question from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much, and good quarter. Jason, you said you’re still looking for 12.7 in technologies, but when I look at all of your defense numbers, you really beat in revenues across the board, so maybe if you can--you know, if I look at where the model was before, it looks like we have a softer fourth quarter to get us home, but that doesn’t seem realistic given the spectacular revenues you had here in the third quarter, so maybe update us, if you could, on where you’re looking for revenues in each of the defense sectors for the year, and should we feel a bigger step-up next year?
Jason Aiken: I think the way to think about the fourth quarter, Cai, is as I alluded to earlier, there is obviously some upward pressure on the revenue on the defense side, nothing to get too specific about and I don’t know that it’s particularly material with just a couple months to go here in the year.  But one way to think about this is this year, let’s talk group by group, in technologies you may remember, last year we had a significant surge in the fourth quarter because we had had a big back-up on the supply chain side at mission systems through the third quarter, and a lot of that flowed through in the fourth quarter, so really a big hockey stick or upswing in the fourth quarter. That’s not the pattern this year. As I mentioned before, they’ve been on a more regular order and a more regular drumbeat, and so we’ll see a more steady state revenue pattern for technologies in the fourth quarter. In combat, likewise it’s historically for some time now been the traditional seasonal pattern for combat to rise throughout the year and have its biggest quarter in the fourth quarter, and we saw that again last year. In this case in 2023, it’s a much more steady drumbeat - again, steady demand, strong volume, but not the traditional seasonal fourth quarter uptick in combat.  In marine, again we’ve already seen tremendous volume well in excess of our expectations. We’re up a billion dollars almost through the first nine months, which is roughly what we expected for the year, so again I’d say more stable quarter to quarter. To summarize, we’re seeing more stable volumes across all three of the defense segments from first quarter to fourth quarter, whereas in the past they’ve risen from first to fourth, so a little bit of an aberration in the pattern. I do expect--again, not to get ahead of the planning process we’re going through, but I expect each of the businesses to show growth going into next year. Can’t get too much more specific about that at this point, but you should see growth in the defense business across all three of the segments going into 2024.
Cai von Rumohr: Very helpful, and then maybe a quick comment on Israel - Hamas has created additional demand, we have this $106 billion request from the President. Can you give us some general color in terms of areas where you think you could see incremental acceleration in demand?
Jason Aiken: You know, the Israel situation obviously is a terrible one, frankly, and one that’s just evolving as we speak. But I think if you look at the incremental demand potential coming out of that, the biggest one to highlight and that really sticks out is probably on the artillery side. Obviously that’s been a big pressure point up to now with Ukraine, one that we’ve been doing everything we can to support our Army customer. We’ve gone from 14,000 rounds per month to 20,000 very quickly. We’re working ahead of schedule to accelerate that production capacity up to 85,000, even as high as 100,000 rounds per month, and I think the Israel situation is only going to put upward pressure on that demand, so that’s the biggest stick-out that I can see.
Nicole Shelton: Abbie, I think we have time for just one more question.
Operator: Excellent, thank you. We will take our final question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning. 
Jason Aiken: Morning Ron.
Ron Epstein: Maybe just two. On land systems, given truly the surge in demand relative to where everybody thought it would be, from a capacity point of view, from a labor point of view, how are you guys set up there to handle it all?
Jason Aiken: You know, I have to give a hand to the guys in the combat systems group in general, and land systems specifically. You’ve really not heard us talk about supply chain bottlenecks, labor capacity or other issues in that group, and that does not mean they have not faced them, they are just--they stand out amongst even a spectacular crowd in the way they’ve handled it. I don’t have any expectation that we’ll see any issues as we look ahead, even as the demand for their product, both domestically as well as internationally, continues to grow.
Ron Epstein: Then maybe just changing gears a bit, nobody really asked a heck of a lot about GDIT. 
Jason Aiken: Thank you for that - finally!
Ron Epstein: Let’s talk about that, it’s a big piece of the company, right? You know a lot about it in particular.  When we think about a path to double-digit margins, how do we get there, and then maybe from an operational point of view, why does not integrating mission and GDIT together kind of make sense, because there’s this bigger demand for software-driven solutions and software and hardware, and you’re seeing this synergy coming out particularly with the application of AI to legacy systems, and so on and so forth. 
Jason Aiken: On the margin side, just to be clear, as I think about double-digit margin for the group, not specifically GDIT - it’s the mix of the two of them together, I absolutely expect this group to be on the march back to low double-digit margin. It’s where they’ve been historically. I think if anything I could articulate as a headwind to that, it’s to the extent that the GDIT side grows faster than the mission systems side, that obviously creates a bit of a macro mix issue that could be a little bit of a headwind in terms of how long it takes us to get there. But frankly, I expect to see us get back into the double-digit margin range here in the fourth quarter, and we’ll see how quickly we can get there in the outlook as we look at ’24 and beyond, but I do expect them to get back on the trajectory toward low double-digit margin. In terms of integration, the way we see this is while they’re very symbiotic businesses and they are dealing with a market that’s dealing with a convergence, to your point in terms of their capabilities, we think that having them separate is appropriate because the investment thesis and the way you run an inherently people business versus an inherently technology development, hardware and production business, are fundamentally different and take different leadership, different priorities and sort of different investment theses.  The good news is that by having them together in the same group and in a coordinated way, we are making investments and addressing the evolving technologies jointly as a group, and we are making sure we are being efficient at that and effective at that, not duplicative, not missing anything, and bringing the requisite skills, to your point, from end to end, whether it’s the hardware side, the services, the software capabilities, solutions as a service, software services and so on, together in joint capability. I think we get the best of both worlds that way in terms of the way we manage and run the businesses, but also the way we can bring combined capabilities to the customer set.
Nicole Shelton: Great. Everyone, thank you for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company’s 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I turn the call over to Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Before I discuss the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the loss of our long-time Board member and Lead Director, Jim Crown. Jim has a record of distinguished service on the GD Board for over 35 years. Throughout that time, Jim provided guidance to more than five different management teams. We mourn his passing, and our prayers are with his family. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $2.70 per diluted share on revenue of $10.2 billion, operating earnings of $962 million and net income of $744 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our four business segments. Importantly, we had a 12% revenue increase across the Defense segments, with a more modest 4.6% increase at Aerospace. While revenue is up by $963 million or 10.5%, operating earnings are down $16 million and net earnings are down $22 million against last year’s second quarter. So, we had significant revenue increase but lower operating margin against the year-ago quarter. From a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.14 per share on significantly higher revenue and modestly lower operating margin than anticipated by the sell side. The earnings beat was exclusively operations-driven. We enjoyed very nice sequential improvement. Revenue was up $271 million, and operating earnings are up $24 million on identical operating margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $20 billion is up $1.45 billion or 7.8% over last year’s first half. Operating earnings of $1.9 billion are up less than 1% and net earnings are down $22 million, largely as a result of below-the-line items, including a higher provision for income taxes. As Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after capital expenditures in the quarter continued at a very good pace. For the first half, free cash flow was 123% of net income. Obviously, we are off to a very good start from a cash perspective. As is clear from the press release, we also had a powerful order quarter across the business, extending our already large backlog. Jason will provide full color around that item as well. In summary, this is from a revenue perspective, a very strong quarter and a good first half. Supply chain issues and past COVID labor issues have impacted operating margins, but there is relief in sight. We expect improvement as we progress. At this point, let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong order activity, growing backlog and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the Technologies group in the quarter.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1 for the Company. Order activity was strong across the board, as each segment had a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater in the quarter. This is quite impressive in light of the strong revenue growth. Combat Systems and Aerospace did particularly well with book-to-bills of 1.4 times and 1.3 times, respectively. This led to record-level backlog of $91.4 billion at the end of the quarter, up 1.7% from last quarter and up 4.3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $129 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We generated $731 million of operating cash flow, which, following our strong first quarter performance, brings us to $2.2 billion for the first six months of the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $519 million for the quarter and over $1.8 billion year-to-date, yielding a cash conversion rate of 123% for the first half. This conversion rate reflects continued strong cash performance in Aerospace and Technologies and a particularly strong start to the year for the Combat Systems group from payments received on our large international vehicle programs. The year-to-date results are consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%. Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $212 million, or 2.1% of sales in the quarter, which brings us to 1.9% of sales for the first six months. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be higher in the second half of the year, but in line with our expectation to be just under 2.5% of sales for the year. Also in the quarter, we paid $360 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of stock for $288 million. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 1.8 million shares for $378 million. We also repaid $750 million of debt that matured in May and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.1 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down nearly $700 million from year-end. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million maturing in the third quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $89 million compared to $95 million last year. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $180 million, down from $193 million for the same period in 2022. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $360 million. Finally, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 16%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 16.5%. There’s no change to our outlook for the full year of approximately 17%. But of course, that implies a rate in the mid-17% range for the second half of the year. To shape that for you, we’d expect the rate to be somewhat lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth due to typical timing items. Now turning to operating performance in Technologies. It was another solid quarter with revenue of $3.2 billion, which is up 7% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong start to the year we saw in the first quarter. In fact, each business grew year-over-year, both in the quarter and the first half. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect. So we feel good about their prospects for the balance of the year. GDIT had another solid quarter, in fact, their highest second quarter revenues since before the pandemic as they continue to deliver on their steady year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings in the quarter were $283 million, yielding a margin of 8.8%. As you know, margins are driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume, and in this case, were further impacted by the mix of new start programs that are driving the strong growth trajectory. Backlog grew during the quarter, with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1:1 on solid order activity that outpaced the strong revenue growth across the business. In fact, GDIT booked the highest first-half orders they’ve seen since mid-2019, and their pipeline remains robust with $20 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $81 billion in qualified opportunities identified. Now, let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments and give an update on our guidance for 2023.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. Now, let me continue to review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide color as appropriate and guidance for the full year. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.95 billion and operating earnings of $236 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue was $86 million more than last year’s second quarter on the strength of additional new aircraft deliveries, coupled with higher Gulfstream service center volume, partially offset by less volume in Jet Aviation’s completion center. The 24 deliveries are modestly fewer than planned and are a result of supply chain issues. On the good news side of the equation, supply chain conditions are improving. We still have a significant backlog of late parts, but processes are in place to catch up, deliveries are trending positive and we have greater transparency. In short, the suppliers are more predictable and are complying with catch-up schedules. This will help both revenue and margins as we do less out-of-station work. Operating earnings of $236 million are $2 million behind last year’s second quarter as a result of a 60 basis-point reduction in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was off largely as a result of the supply chain issues and higher R&D expense. The shortage of parts continues to cause significant out-of-station work, impacting efficiency. As mentioned earlier, we see improvement here, and that should help as we go through the second half. Sequentially, Aerospace had a 3.2% increase in revenue and a 3.1% increase in operating earnings on identical operating margins. Moving to the demand environment. Aerospace had a very good quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 in dollar terms and even higher for Gulfstream aircraft alone. Vibrant sales activity and strong pipeline replenishment were evident in the quarter. The U.S., particularly large corporations, led the way with the Mid East and Asia participating to a lesser degree. The 700 flight test and certification program continues to progress. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature. However, we now target certification in the fourth quarter and see no major obstacles in our path. To give you a little more insight, we will complete our FAA Type Inspection Authorization in September. This is a flying we are required to do pursuant to FAA requirement and plan. When we are finished, the FAA will fly some confirmatory flight tests to verify portions of our results. That will be followed by a brief period of paper submission, followed by FAA review. As most of you know, we had planned to deliver considerable number of G700s in the third and fourth quarters. That has now flipped into the fourth quarter. We now expect to deliver 27 aircraft in the third quarter, with a rapid increase in the fourth quarter deliveries. In short, we are making good progress under difficult circumstances. However, we expect to deliver 5 to 6 fewer aircraft than the 145 we forecast at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we expect more service revenue than initially anticipated. I’ll have more on this later in my remarks. Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.92 billion, up a stunning 15.5% over the year-ago quarter with growth in each of the business units. Earnings of $251 million are up 2.4%. Margins at 13% represent a 170 basis-point reduction over the year-ago quarter. So, we saw powerful revenue performance, coupled with more modest operating margin, in large part attributable to mix. The increase in revenue came from international vehicle programs at both Land Systems and European Land Systems. OTS has also enjoyed higher artillery program volume, including programs to expand production capacity for the U.S. government. These programs carry dilutive margins, but will result in more production at accretive margins over time. On a sequential basis, revenue is up $168 million or 9.6%, and earnings are up $6 million or 2.4% on a 100 basis-point reduction in margin for the reasons described. Year-to-date, revenue is up $339 million or 10.1%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 5.1%. We also experienced very strong order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in a 1.4:1 book-to-bill, evidencing strong demand for munitions and domestic combat vehicles. International programs also contributed to the strong book-to-bill. So, a very exciting first half for Combat. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.1 billion is up $408 million, a robust 15.4% against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth, and to a lesser degree, TAO growth. Operating earnings are $235 million, up $24 million over the year-ago quarter, with a 30 basis-point decrement in operating margin. We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $67 million or 2.2%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 11.4% on a 60 basis-point improvement in margin. For the first half, revenue was up $749 million or 14.1% and earnings are up $24 million or 5.7%. So, a good quarter and first half. So, let me move on to give you our updated forecast for the year. The figures I’m about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won’t repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to all of this, will be posted on our website, which should be helpful. In Aerospace, revenue will be down almost $200 million due to the 5 or 6 fewer aircraft deliveries, offset in part by stronger service activity. So look for revenue of $10.2 billion. We also expect margins to be down from a projected 14.6% to 14.1%. This implies operating earnings of $1.4 billion. With respect to the Defense businesses, Combat Systems will have revenue of $400 million to $500 million higher than previously projected due to new program starts and an increased threat environment. So look for the total revenue of around $7.75 billion. Margins will be down 50 basis points from 14.7% to 14.2% on mix. All-in, operating earnings will be up $25 million over the previous forecast. Marine Systems revenue should be up $900 million or $1 billion on acceleration of work throughout the yards. This is a leading indicator of improving efficiency. So, we will have annual revenue around $11.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.6% for the reasons I have previously described to you. Operating earnings for the year should be up $20 million over the previous forecast. Technologies revenue will be $100 million to $200 million better than previous guidance, but operating margin will be 9.4%, 10 basis points lower than previously forecast. So for the group, we expect annual revenue of about $12.7 billion, with operating earnings around $1.2 billion, steady with prior guidance. There is some opportunity here to capture 10 to 20 basis points of margin. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue higher than our initial guidance and an overall operating margin about 40 basis points lower. So look for total revenue to be around $42.45 billion, about $1.2 billion up from previous guidance. Operating earnings should be down modestly from prior guidance, but below-the-line items and lower share count will leave our EPS guidance the same. One final note before I conclude my comments. Howard has informed the Company that he intends to retire later this year. So, this will be his last earnings call. We are grateful for the excellent work that Howard has done since joining our team. I hope many of you will join me in congratulating Howard on a job well done. Nicole Shelton, whom some of you know already, will be taking over the mantle with the third quarter call. That concludes my remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions.
Howard Rubel: Thank you for your kind words and friendship. It’s been a pleasure and a great experience to have had the opportunity to represent General Dynamics to the investment community these nearly six years. I have grown working side by side with many of the talented people of this tremendous enterprise. I look forward to working with Nicole over the next few months to ensure there are proper introductions and a seamless transition. There will be time ahead to say goodbye, but today, I want to say thank you. Now, let’s turn to the question-and-answer period of this call. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JP Morgan.
Seth Seifman: Hey. Thanks very much. Good morning, and congratulations, Howard. Thanks for everything. Just on the new Aerospace guidance, I guess, maybe if you could walk through how you thought about the setup for that. And I appreciate that this is mainly a timing issue and that any airplanes that don’t get delivered in ‘23 can kind of move to ‘24. But just kind of the way we get level set. With 27 deliveries in the third quarter, we’re talking about something quite high to get to 140-ish for the year. And also, I mean, with 27 deliveries, I assume we’ll be looking at a margin in Q3 that’s probably still in the 12s and so also getting to 14.1% for the year. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the margin -- the initial margin accretion from the new aircraft and what that contribution will be to the total deliveries.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So, I think you’ve put your finger on a nub of an issue. So, what we have given you with respect to Aerospace is Gulfstream’s plan, and the guidance that we gave you reflects their plan. Our January guidance, just for context, contemplated a very high Q4 delivery rate. That rate increased with the certification delay on the 700. 700 will be fully built and ready for delivery. Remember, too, our new planes are all built in purpose-built facilities. We’ve expanded our wing line. In short, we’ve facilitized for increased production. And finally, the fact that we have planes -- and you can see this from the increase in inventory that are awaiting parts, we now have a schedule, and all of that taken together allows us to -- will give us the ability to deliver. With respect to margin, we’ve got a number of higher-margin airplanes, as you would expect, delivering in the fourth quarter. So, that provides significant uplift. So, we kind of explained how we intend to get the revenue through the deliveries, and the margin is really a question of mix of higher deliveries of higher-margin -- greater deliveries of higher-margin airplanes.
Seth Seifman: Okay. And just a follow-up real quick on this topic. The 27 deliveries in Q3 would be down year-on-year. And so in terms of -- there’s the issue of the G700 certification, which we’re all kind of looking at and it’s hard to analyze. But just for the non-G700 deliveries, is there any risk around what the plan was there and what Gulfstream expects to do?
Phebe Novakovic: So, as I noted in my remarks, our supply chain is increasing its transparency, improving its processes. And we have reliable -- increasingly reliable schedules. That said, they’re more likely -- likely to anticipate more catch-up in the fourth quarter, which will allow us to complete a number of those airplanes, but they’re still impacting the third quarter deliveries.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: I can’t believe Howard’s retiring. He’s so young.
Phebe Novakovic: That’s what we say.
Robert Stallard: Anyway, I’ve got a couple of questions for you, Phebe. First of all, on the revised Aerospace guidance, you mentioned that you’ve increased your expectations for services for the full year. I was wondering if you could square this with what we’ve been seeing in Biz Jet flight hours year-to-date, which have been down year-on-year. And then secondly, a great Combat Systems order quarter, but how do you expect these orders to flow through to revenue growth over the next couple of years? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: So, our flying hours are not down. But I think, too, the way to think about our service business is we expect service to increase as the fleet of airplanes -- new airplanes in the market increases. So, we expect steady growth in service. And we haven’t seen any impact so far on any change in flying hours. I said that mostly other people flying hours. With respect to Combat, the world has become a less safe place, and that’s reflected in the increased demand, both internationally and in the United States. So we expect the -- this year to be considerably higher than last year. And we’ll give you clarity around 2024 in January. But as you may recall, we had anticipated flat to down growth in this business segment. Clearly, that trajectory has changed. We won’t be able to -- we can’t quantify it right now, but we’ll give you more clarity on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays.
David Strauss: So, back on the G700, would you expect to make up the missed deliveries this year? Would you expect them to make those up next year? So does the -- I think, what was -- 170 go higher in terms of what you’re expecting for deliveries next year?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, we’ll get into next year, next year. But the deliveries are lower, are -- 5 to 6 deliveries that won’t deliver this year are not 700s. So, it’s other airplanes.
David Strauss: Okay. Got it. And then as a follow-up -- quick follow-up. Combat Systems, you’ve mentioned this during the prepared remarks, the lower margins in the quarter, and then it looks like you’re forecasting a bit of a snapback in the second half of the year, but still a fair amount lower than what you were initially forecasting. Could you just give a little bit more detail on the mix and how that’s impacting? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So mix in this instance is comprised of two elements. One is the capacity expansion, which I noted carries lower margin. And then it’s really the transition from more mature programs to newer programs, and those margins will improve as we come down our learning curves.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.
Cai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thanks so much. So -- and Howard, let me say, you’ve been terrific to work with and a great friend, and I wish you all the best.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Cai.
Cai von Rumohr: So, Phebe, how many 700s are you assuming to deliver in the fourth quarter? And what kind of margin for error is there in terms of timing in terms of...
Phebe Novakovic: We will deliver 19 G700s, and we’re not going to tell you margins will be accretive. Nice try. Well, have we ever given you margins by airplane?
Cai von Rumohr: No, no, no. I just -- so -- and next -- I didn’t mean -- I meant how much time-wise, a cushion you have in the schedule if the certification slips.
Phebe Novakovic: You mean the schedule for the 700 certification?
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. I mean, is your best guess that you certify in the middle of November, in middle of December, which could impact the amount number of planes you get out…
Phebe Novakovic: So, what we’ve told you is our best estimate right now of the certification process. Clearly, if it comes very late in the year, we’ll deliver airplanes, but we won’t necessarily be able to deliver all of them. That will bleed over into the best first quarter GD has ever had in its history. But we’re not anticipating that at the moment. So, I don’t have real good clarity because we don’t know yet with precision on when in the fourth quarter. But our best estimate, what we’re planning for right now is that we will be able to have sufficient time to deliver these airplanes. Remember, they’re built -- the pilot training will start, and that will help significantly with deliveries.
Cai von Rumohr: Got it. And with all of these deliveries in the fourth quarter, maybe, Jason, can you give us some color in terms of the cash flow profile? I mean, do we have just a momentous fourth quarter cash? And is there any upside to the 105%?
Jason Aiken: The way I think you need to think about that, Cai, is when it comes to Gulfstream, we have a sequence of progress payments that occurs from the time of the initial order through delivery and entry into service. So, the vast majority of the cash receipts associated with an aircraft order and aircraft delivery are in-house before the actual airplane is delivered. So, while there’s obviously an implied set of progress payments, final delivery payments would occur at that point. When those aircraft enter into service, it’s not an outsized level of cash, one way or the other. So, the bigger issue is you’ve got an ongoing sequence and series of progress payments associated with all of the orders in the order book. And with the significant order volume that we’ve had over the past 2, 2.5 years, that is sort of a machine that’s just churning those progress payments over time as we continue to make progress on each of those airplane builds as well as the certification process.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. And congratulations on retirement, Howard. Miss you. In terms of the -- the outlook for Aerospace orders, could you just comment, Phebe, what you’re seeing for the rest of the year? Obviously, the second quarter was probably helped a little bit because of the anomaly you mentioned in March around the banking crisis. And then also if you can comment on churn in the backlog, I think your net book-to-bill was a couple of hundred million lighter than your gross book-to-bill. So maybe just talk about any cancellations.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So, the demand in the second quarter was at the same level as the demand in the first quarter. It felt very, very similar. As you quite rightly note, we had a three-week hiatus coincident with the banking -- many banking crisis. But the demand levels have remained about the same. And as we enter Q3, we have a very strong pipeline. And so far, activity is quite good in Q3. We had six defaults in the quarter, but nothing that is notable to us. And the backlog is holding up very, very well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup.
Jason Gursky: Congrats, Howard. I look forward to getting some postcards from our in distant places. Phebe, just sticking with Gulfstream for one last question, hopefully here. On the pipeline and kind of what you see from a bottom-up perspective, can you give us a little flavor from a geographic perspective and customer type? How is high net worth doing versus corporate? And are we beginning to see some green shoots in geographies outside the United States?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So, the United States was strong, has been strong, particularly with the Fortune 500. I would say that high net worth is about the same. And the Mid East is pretty good, as is Asia, but it’s really the Fortune 500 that are really driving the demand. These are long-established customers as well as new Fortune 500 customers.
Jason Gursky: Okay, great. And then, Jason, over to you on Technologies. It sounds like you’ve got a robust pipeline of opportunities in front of you. Can you talk a little bit about the mix of that? We had some margin degradation here in the quarter. I’m just kind of curious, as you look out at that pipeline, do you see anything that would suggest we’re going to see a departure in any -- either higher or lower from a margin perspective as you bid on this work and bring it in?
Jason Aiken: I think bottom line, the short answer to that is no. We don’t see any fundamental change, as we’ve talked about. You’re going to see some level of aggregate margin perturbation between the two businesses, the IT services side being somewhat lower obviously than the hardware side. I think in this quarter, we saw it a little more pronounced because as we’re seeing this turn for the group to a stronger growth level, a lot of that is driven by not only new starts, but it’s actually replacement contracts, or I should say, recompetes that we’ve won. So, you had in the prior year the trailing off of very mature-level legacy contracts that were closing out at higher margin rates as compared to the entry-level margin rates we’re seeing now. So, that’s sort of the driver of the year-over-year delta that you’re seeing. But barring any major structural shift between the percentage contributions of the IT services versus defense hardware parts of the business, we continue to expect this to be a low double-digit margin business over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: Yes. Hey. Good morning. And ditto Cai’s remarks, Howard, you will be missed. It’s been a pleasure working with you. So quickly, a couple of questions. On Technologies, what should we be looking for? I mean, sometimes the contracts there aren’t as obvious in the horizon. So, Jason, what should we be looking out for in the second half of the year as potential things you guys could win?
Jason Aiken: Ron, it’s always tough in this business to point to a singular event or a contract that is going to drive the overall business. As you know, it’s a wide portfolio of literally thousands of contracts. I think -- the thing I would tell you is, when you look at Mission Systems on the one hand, they are really seeing strong support in their -- what I’d call, their Navy platform support businesses, whether it’s the strategic side or the mission computing side. They’re also seeing really great support in their cyber portfolio. So, those are two areas I would expect to see continued growth in particular out of that business. When you look at GDIT, they’re seeing strength in all three of their customer segments: the defense, the intelligence community and the Fed SIV side. So, really good across-the-board support in GDIT. And I think if I could point to any one thing in particular on that side of the portfolio, we’ve talked for the past few weeks, a couple of months about some selective technology investments they’ve been making to accelerate their growth, and we’re seeing that really start to take hold. And of course, we’re talking about things like artificial intelligence, machine learning, hybrid cloud, Zero Trust and so on. And that’s really starting to bear fruit. We’ve seen already several hundred million dollars worth of award wins as well as organic growth on existing contracts that’s resulting directly from those investments. They’ve got some $7 billion in change in post-submittal submissions that are awaiting award decisions. And they’ve got another 20-plus, I think, between $20 billion, $25 billion of opportunities in the pipeline that are directly tied to those targeted investments. So, I think some really intelligent capital allocation over there at GDIT to try and drive that growth, and we’d expect to see the results of that continue in the second half of the year and beyond.
Ron Epstein: Okay, great. And then maybe one follow-on for Phebe. When we think about Aero, when things start to normalize, right, supply chain kind of gets back to a normal cadence and all that, what should we be thinking about broadly as like a realistic margin target?
Phebe Novakovic: We’re thinking in the higher teens when we get on a steady state with upside potential.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair.
Louie DiPalma: Howard, thank you for your deep aerospace-defense expertise in your current position and your former position on the sell side, your high standards raised the level of those around you. For Jason, for the Army’s CHS-6 $8 billion recompete that should be announced, I think, very soon. GD Mission Solutions is teaming with GDIT. Do you feel these synergistic joint bids between IT and Mission will become more common and a significant strategic advantage for you? And could it help return the overall Technologies segment to mid-single-digit growth over the long term?
Jason Aiken: Yes. And bottom line answer, you kind of hit the nail on the head there. We absolutely expect the synergistic benefits of these two businesses working together to be to our benefit over the long run. It’s -- the predicate for all that is that what we’ve seen both in the customer demand environment, what they’re requiring in terms of end-to-end solutions, including both software, services and the hardware elements of what we provide. We’re seeing the peer group migrate that way with some of their M&A activities that you’ve seen in the market. And so, we believe that is the thesis that we’ll see play out. You noted CHS-6, we’re obviously participating in and anticipating that -- resolution to that competition. We’ve seen that program migrate over time from one that was traditionally very much focused on high-end, customized, ruggedized hardened-type defense hardware to one that is a combination of that type of capability as well as a more traditional, sort of off-the-shelf catalog-type product. And so, we believe that having the attributes of both GDIT and Mission Systems involved in that program would be the best suited to serve our customer there. So, that’s just one good example of it. But absolutely, we see that over time. And as far as long-term growth rates, we’ll have to see where this leads. Right now, we continue to track low- to mid-single digit, but we’ll see if we can’t get some juice out of that over time.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Howard, exactly what Louie said, and then, thank you for being such a great colleague and a teacher to me and all those around you, so thank you. Phebe or Jason, whoever, on the Defense business, when you look at your 2023 guidance, Defense growth is up solidly up 5% for the year versus the 9% growth you did in the first half. But this is not necessarily leading to operating leverage with margin contraction of 40 bps and flat operating profit. So, how do you think about the return to operating margin expansion either on a total company level or a segment basis? It seems like Technologies is more temporary, Combat mix maybe continues for some time.
Phebe Novakovic: So, Technologies and Combat are simply a question of mix. And I suspect Combat will quickly return to its normal operating leverage. The Marine Group has significant supply chain challenges that have impacted for the Virginia-class in particular. That’s going to take some time to resolve. We’ll talk about that in a little bit more detail. So, as I noted, we expect slow quarter-over-quarter margin growth in the Marine Group, perhaps an occasional perturbation by quarter, but slow and steady improvement over time.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets.
Ken Herbert: Congratulations, Howard. Phebe, I just wanted to dig into Marine again a little deeper. The full year guide implies a pretty significant deceleration in growth into the back half of the year. Two questions, really. First, as we go back six months, you were talking about a much more conservative outlook for the top line in Marine. And clearly, maybe any comments on really what’s changed because the first half has really been much stronger than expected. But then also, as you think about the remainder of the year, what will drive the significant step down and how much conservatism does the Marine outlook reflect in terms of the growth?
Phebe Novakovic: So, growth in the quarter was driven by improved -- increased volume on Columbia and on the oiler program as well as additional throughput throughout each one of those yards, which is often a precursor to better margin performance. And finally, just the -- revenue came in faster than we had anticipated, really across the board. And that will drive our expectations. With respect to the margin performance, we have -- Columbia is doing very well. We’ve got nice performance on the oiler. We see some deck plate improvements of Bath, but that has yet to translate into financial performance. Electric Boat needs to continue to get better to offset likely additional supply chain challenges as the Virginia supply chain begins to improve. And with respect to that supply chain, we see improvements and some very nice improvement in some area. But that supply chain was hit hard by COVID. And I think a little bit of explanation there is helpful. COVID impacted that supply chain, Virginia supply chain, in particular, in a couple of ways. Obviously, the impact of COVID itself, the workforce disruption. Then we had the large demographic changeover. And finally, Virginia was impacted by the Columbia prioritization. All of that made it difficult for that supply chain to begin to get back on cadence. They’re getting better, but we’ve got a while to go before they hit their two-a-year or more cadence.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.
Peter Arment: Thank you. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Congrats, Howard. Hey Phebe, within Combat, munitions kind of is viewed as a potential source of kind of upside volume, and thanks for all the color on the segment. But how should we be thinking about the munitions growth profile? I mean, it’s about -- finished last year, about 27% of your mix. Do you expect that mix to continue to grow? And any comments on the supply chain there as my follow-up, just because I know there’s been talk about challenges there. Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: The supply chain in the Combat group has been less of an issue. I suspect that the -- at least for the foreseeable future, the munitions portion of the business will remain about that, same as we see uplift in all of our all three businesses. We’ll see OTS at about that same level. We’ve already increased munitions capacity and working with the federal government and the Army and OSD in particular, we have a very detailed plan to further increase capacity, which will allow us then to increase production very rapidly and move to the left, the munition availability to meet the United States’ needs and, frankly, external needs as well.
Howard Rubel: Operator, we’ll just take one more question, please.
Operator: And our final question for today comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Good morning, and congratulations, Howard. I didn’t figure I’d outlast you, but we’ve known each other a lot of years and...
Howard Rubel: George, it’s over 40, just counting.
George Shapiro: That’s right. Phebe, on the defaults that you mentioned, can you just mention what kind of customers they might have been? And I assume you keep the down-payments that might have been made on the aircraft that they order?
Phebe Novakovic: So I think you know we have very strong terms and conditions that you forfeit some of your value in the airplane when you cancel. I don’t actually know the context of the default, that won’t -- nothing that was of note or interest, otherwise, I’d know it.
George Shapiro: Okay. And Jason, the unbilled receivables was actually up like $100 million sequentially. So, does that mean you didn’t get any payments from the expected customers in the quarter? And how much would you expect the rest of the year to come in?
Jason Aiken: Actually, George, we did receive additional payments on schedule as per the plan that was set forth several years ago. And I’m actually happy to tell you that at this point -- and maybe this terminates this line of dialogue for the foreseeable future. The arrears that you all may remember from many years ago on that Canadian international program has now effectively been paid down, and we are down to what I would call a normal run rate of operating working capital on that program. So I’m pleased to report that we’ve passed through that phase. In terms of what we expect to receive for the balance of the year, there are some more progress payments to come in, but I don’t have that quantified off the top of my head.
George Shapiro: Something you had kind of given what the specifics were on that in the Q.
Howard Rubel: We’ll follow up on that.
Jason Aiken: Yes.
Howard Rubel: Operator, that now ends the call. And for those that are interested in connecting later, we’ll have follow-up questions. Please don’t hesitate to call me. Thank you for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. And as I said, if you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-26 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.  On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I turn the call over to Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.64 per diluted share on revenue of $9.9 billion, operating earnings of $938 million and net earnings of $730 million. Revenue is up $489 million or 5.2% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $30 million and net earnings are flat against the year ago quarter. This increase in operating earnings was offset by a $31 million increase in the tax provision.  Recall that the first quarter 2022 tax provision was only 14%. Nevertheless, earnings per share are up $0.03 as a result of the stronger operating earnings and a lower share count. The operating margin for the entire company was 9.5%, 20 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This reflected lower operating margins in Aerospace and Marine, which I will address in some detail later in these remarks. Revenue was $489 million better than first quarter '22. All of the defense units were up and Aerospace down slightly, less than 1% on fewer aircraft deliveries. We beat consensus by $0.05 per share. We have roughly $550 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and lower-than-anticipated margins, leading to operating earnings basically consistent with expectations. The earnings per share beat was largely attributable to below the line items.  As Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after CapEx was very strong. This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in '22 and not at all typical for us in the first quarter. Obviously, we were off to a very good start from a cash perspective. This is an important respects, a strong quarter, a good foundation for the year, subject to some supply chain issues that I will try to eliminate as we discuss the business segments.  At this point, let me ask Jason to provide detail on our order activity, solid backlog and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the Technologies group in the quarter.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 0.9:1 for the company. Order activity was particularly strong in the Combat Systems group, which had a book-to-bill of 1.5x. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $89.8 billion, off 1.4% from the end of last year, but up 3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $128 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. It was another exceptional start to the year, with operating cash flow of $1.46 billion, representing 200% of net income. This very strong cash flow was heavily loaded in the last few weeks of the quarter. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a cash conversion rate of 178%. While we continue to enjoy strong cash performance in Aerospace & Technologies, the Combat Systems group, in particular, delivered outstanding free cash flow this quarter. As expected, the U.K. resumed payments on the AJAX program. This coupled with the ongoing progress payments on our other large international vehicle program drove the group's cash performance. This is consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%.  Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $161 million or 1.6% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year. Also in the quarter, we paid $345 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 400,000 shares of stock for $90 million at just over $220 per share. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $2 billion and a net debt position of $8.5 billion, down nearly $800 million from year-end. As a reminder, we have $750 million of debt maturing in the second quarter and we are in a position to pay that down with the cash on hand following the receipts at the end of the first quarter.  Our net interest expense in the quarter was $91 million compared to $98 million last year. Benefiting from the debt repayment in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, we had a 17% effective tax rate in the quarter, consistent with our full year guidance.  Now turning to operating performance in Technologies. We're off to a solid start. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was up 2.5% over the prior year, modestly ahead of our expectations for the start of the year. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect, which gives us confidence about their outlook for the balance of the year. And GDIT had their highest quarterly revenue and earnings in 4 years as they continue to deliver on their year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings of $299 million were consistent with last year, yielding a margin of 9.2%.  As we discussed in January, margins will continue to be driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume. Backlog grew during the quarter with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1 on strong order activity in IT services that included some important wins not yet factored into the backlog. This includes the Army's flight test school training support services contract valued at $1.7 billion. And Air Force IDIQ with a total potential value of $4.5 billion between 2 awardees for security support services, and a pair of IDIQ contracts with the EPA with a potential value of $380 million to support the agency's environmental and climate initiatives.  In fact, GDIT booked the highest orders they've seen since the second quarter of 2019. And their pipeline remains robust with $19 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $84 billion in qualified opportunities identified.  Now let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. Now I may review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace held its own in a very difficult operating environment. It had revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $229 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue was $11 million less than last year's first quarter despite the delivery of 4 fewer aircraft. The fewer aircraft deliveries were almost completely offset by higher ball stream services, debt aviation volume and special missions work at Gulfstream. The 21 deliveries in the quarter are 3 fewer than planned, two 280s did not deliver because of late engine deliveries. The other plan, a large cabin for an international customer didn't deliver because of simple bureaucratic registration delays in the owner's country.  Importantly, this is the first quarter in which we have missed an airplane delivery as a result of supply chain issues. Up until now, we have managed to work around late to schedule parts delivery. Operating earnings of $229 million or $14 million behind last year's first quarter as a result of a 70 basis point degradation in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was under pressure as a result of fewer new airplane deliveries, a less attractive mix, severe supply chain issues, some modest cost increases from suppliers and the prebuild of G700. Let's take a look at some of these elements in greater detail.  The shortage of parts to schedule from the supply chain, especially from Honeywell has created significant out-of-station work, which is inherently less efficient. We have a young, well trained and capable workforce. They have, however, never previously been exposed out of station work. They are doing well. I am pleased to report, but it had an impact. The other impact of latest scheduled parts deliveries, apart from cost growth is that we cannot increase our build rate until the supply of parts is more predictable. The good news is that there is light at the end of the tunnel. We see the vast majority of this problem resolving early in the third quarter, but for 2 large suppliers who will take a little longer to resolve.  As most of you know, we plan to deliver a considerable number of G700s in the third and fourth quarters. To do that, we must build them now and incur some period costs without the related revenue. This has impacted the first quarter and will impact the second quarter, but relief is in sight as deliveries commence. Aerospace had a decent quarter from an order perspective with a book-to-bill of 0.9:1 in dollar terms and 1:1 in units. The quarter was looking quite good until the 2 regional bank failures in early March. This created a pause in the market for about 3 weeks. I am pleased to report that normal activity has resumed. Strong sales activity and customer interest is evident in this quarter. The U.S. has been strong and the Middle East as well. China remains slow. The G700 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. The aircraft design, manufacture and the overall program are very mature. We continue to target certification of the G700 for late summer this year.  Gulfstream remains committed to a safe and comprehensive certification test program. Production of customer G700 is well underway, and we are preparing for entry into service. We will deliver a mature, high-quality aircraft.  Looking forward to the next quarter, we expect to deliver 26 aircrafts with rapid increases in the third and fourth quarter deliveries, as we have previously indicated. In short, the Aerospace team did a good job under difficult circumstances.  Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.76 billion, up 4.8% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $245 million are up 7.9% and margins at 14% represent a 40 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. So we saw a strong operating performance coupled with a nice revenue uptick. At Land Systems, Increased revenue came from the MPF ramp-up, Stryker SHORAD and new international vehicle programs for Poland and Australia. At European Land Systems, we had higher Parana volume and OTS enjoyed higher artillery program volume. So we saw increased revenue performance at each of the businesses. Here's a little additional color on Combat Systems revenue results. Foreign exchange fluctuations negatively impacted Combats revenue in the quarter due to the strength of the dollar versus the Canadian dollar, Euro and the British pound. But for the FX headwind, Combat Systems revenue growth would have been up 7.1% over the last year rather than the 4.8% we have just reported. We also experienced very strong order performance at Combat. Orders in the quarter are at their highest level in more than 8 years, evidencing the strong demand for munitions and international combat vehicles. There is clear upward pressure on our forecast for Combat Systems revenue and earnings in the year. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. As an aside, let me repeat a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter of '19. The first quarter of '21 was up 10.6% over '20 and first quarter 2022 was up 6.8% over '21. Finally, this quarter revenue of almost $3 billion is up 12.9% over 2022. This is an impressive growth ramp by any standard. This quarter's growth was led by Columbia class construction and engineering, DDG-51 construction and some T-AO volume. Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, exactly the same as a year ago, but with a 90 basis point decrement in operating margin. The primary driver of lower margins during the quarter was a charge on the Virginia program to reflect cost pressure within our supply chain and efficiency impacts at electric boat as a result of late material deliveries. This was partially offset by Colombia margin improvement.  Other modest margin impacts included an earnings decline at Bath as a result of a onetime pickup in the year ago quarter and cost inflation reimbursement that does not carry profits. Overall, earnings are what we expected, but revenue was higher, resulting in lower margins. We anticipate that this will improve as we progress through the year. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. I would say, however, that our quarterly progression differs from prior years and that the second quarter will be our lowest quarter because of mix and volume across the business.  Nonetheless, we look forward to very strong third and fourth quarters. We will give you a comprehensive update at the end of next quarter as is our custom. This concludes my remarks with respect to what was a challenging but in many respects, rewarding quarter.
Howard Rubel: Thanks, Phebe. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Phebe, I wonder to ask a question about Marine and at the risk of asking the question that you just said that we never update guidance at this time of year. If you can just give us some color, given what we thought about revenue and margin at Marine coming in. The revenue is clearly much stronger in Q1, the margin weaker for the obvious reason of the Virginia charge. Can you help us from here in terms of how the Virginia contribution changes from Q1 going forward now that the charge is done? And it seems Columbia is maybe coming in stronger. And if I could tack on one follow-up, there's been a lot of talk about the Columbia schedule, both in congressional testimony, GAO reports, et cetera. If you can give us the latest update on how you view the schedule for Columbia.
Phebe Novakovic: So we think that we plan to have Q1 as our lowest margin quarter. And we'll continue to work to that. Virginia is -- it will stabilize once we get the schedule and supply chain issues resolved. But at this point, it's some comment on electric boat to continue to do better to offset those costs. So with respect to revenue, there's clearly some upside pressure there, but we're going to hold any other additional comment for the moment.  So let's go to Colombia. And I think just the Navy has clearly articulated it -- firmly articulated that we are ahead of the contract schedule. The contract schedule is what matters. So let's put a little context on this. We are on the Colombia. We are 16 years into the 20-year lead ship schedule. I think within that context, it's indicative of the actions we have taken heretofore and those that we will continue to take to keep this program on schedule.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Phebe, I may be wrong, but it sounds like these supply chain issues in Q1 got worse. So I was wondering if you could comment on that. And also, what sort of mitigation plans you're putting in place to correct these problems?
Phebe Novakovic: Specifically, are you talking about a particular group?
Robert Stallard: Well, it seems like it's Aerospace and the Virginia-class submarine and marine.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So with Aerospace, we have -- let's be clear, we have been dealing with supply chain issues for some time, and we've been able to manage through them. This quarter, we had 2 large suppliers get worse. We have, however, as I noted in my remarks, light at the end of the tunnel by our clear visibility in -- through our clear visibility into the third and fourth quarters where the majority of the supply chain improves. And we're working very hard with all suppliers, both in terms of teams and additional production help and to also encourage them to allocate the necessary resources in order to make their contracting schedules. So we are pretty comfortable that we can resolve these issues in the third and fourth quarter. But Gulfstream has done a magnificent job heretofore in even this quarter and managing through these challenges. With respect to the Virginia-class program, we have been talking about the supply chain challenges for some time. And as with all heavy manufacturing and labor-intensive manufacturing construction projects, manpower is a significant impact and the impact from the -- and the ramifications from the pandemic hit that supply chain pretty hard. We're beginning to see that remedy with the help of the Navy and a lot of support. So we'll continue to work with our supply chain and all elements of that supply chain as well as our customer who is very engaged to ensure that we can get that Virginia cadence back on schedule.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: Phebe, on -- when we're looking at the situation in Europe right now, I mean, 2 things seem to stand out to us with respect to Combat. One is, as you mentioned, the demand for munitions. But we've seen in the 2024 budget, there was actually a reduction in the budget for munitions, which we found somewhat surprising. How do you think about the trajectory there? And your ability to -- assuming we are going to see significant growth in munitions demand and your ability to ramp up production over time?
Phebe Novakovic: We have been working very closely with DoD and the Army to ensure that we increase production and move...
Douglas Harned: Hello?
Phebe Novakovic: Hello, can you hear us?
Jason Aiken: Operator?
Operator: He appears to have lost audio.
Jason Aiken: Okay. Are we still...
Phebe Novakovic: Let me answer, Doug. Can the rest of the call here us?
Operator: Yes, we are still live.
Phebe Novakovic: Okay. So let me answer Doug's question. We've been working very closely with DoD and the Army to increase production and throughput. And we've done that in a couple of ways, upgrading existing facilities increasing the number of shifts and building new facilities with more modern equipment. So to, again, accelerate production, we have already done so and are quite confident in our ability to do even more.  So we are -- we've been receiving adequate and -- completely adequate funding to execute all of this. And we are quite confident that we will move throughput much quicker and will expedite the delivery of this critical capability to the Army.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.
Peter Arment: Phebe, thanks for the color on Gulfstream. Just on the overall demand kind of restrengthening in the quarter post the banks in the Middle East and certainly the U.S. Are you still seeing kind of broad interest across all the models? I know you've mentioned G650 in particular the last like 2 years has been very strong.
Phebe Novakovic: Broad interest across all the models. We're doing quite well. Do you want to ask another question?
Peter Arment: Yes, sure. No, I appreciate that. Just staying within Gulfstream. Just I know that you're not going to update kind of guidance, but I -- the deliveries that you missed this quarter, are they expected to recover in the second quarter? How are we thinking about that? Or is this all kind of second half related?
Phebe Novakovic: We will resolve -- we expect to resolve all of the supply chain issues. And what you ought to think about is the third quarter and fourth quarter being quite robust. And I think what you're getting at is the deliveries that we expect to execute for the year at about 145. We're pretty confident we can get there. If we miss, it's just going to be by a little.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.
Myles Walton: Phebe, I was hoping you could talk to how you balance within Marine higher-priority national -- the national level of the Columbia class, which is under a lower financial risk cost plus contract versus the higher financial pressure, Virginia class which is under fixed price contract, but you might have to pull resources away and just how you're managing that from a financial risk perspective?
Phebe Novakovic: So implicit in your question is the fact that Colombia enjoys a higher national rating in terms of urgency than Virginia. We had fully contemplated that with the U.S. Navy when we negotiated the most recent block of Virginia that was in concert timing wise with the Columbia negotiation. So we're working with the Navy to ensure that the language that we had incorporated into the Virginia contract to accommodate any such impacts on Virginia from a Columbia prioritization could be addressed. And the Navy has been working very closely with us. So we were mindful of that and have been for some time.
Myles Walton: And so I guess just for a clarification, Phebe. Did the current financials reflect that assumption playing out? Or would there be a sort of equitable relief in the future if they agree with the position?
Phebe Novakovic: I'm not going to speculate on how this will be addressed ultimately with our customer. But, this is more of a future issue rather than in the moment issue. That was not the primary driver of the quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: If you hadn't had the loss of 3 weeks from the bank failures, I assume then the book-to-bill would have been above 1 in the first quarter. And is that likely to continue then in the second quarter where you're saying we are seeing significant strength now?
Phebe Novakovic: So our plan going before March 10, was that, in fact, we had anticipated a book-to-bill -- full book-to-bill of 1:1 on at that point, higher deliveries. So on a going-forward basis, it's our working assumption that we will continue to see 1:1. And at the moment, we see no reason why that can't be achieved.
George Shapiro: Okay. So the delivery expectations for next year would still be the same as what you had laid out before?
Phebe Novakovic: We are holding to what we gave you in terms of out-year expectations for Aerospace.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair.
Louie DiPalma: Is the lead Columbia approximately 1/3 complete now?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes.
Louie DiPalma: Great. And as a follow-up, you referenced supply chain headwinds with Virginia and Aerospace. Is the supply chain for Mission Systems improving at all?
Jason Aiken: It absolutely is. We saw a good trajectory and gaining some traction in the quarter. That's part of the reason why volume was up nicely in the quarter, and they seem to be on a good path to overcoming that bottleneck in their system. So gives us confidence for the opportunities we have in the second half of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: Phebe, per new plans unveiled last month under the August pack, it looks like Australia could buy up to 5 Virginia-class submarines potentially in the early 2030s. So with the backlog now of 17 Virginia is delivering through 2032, how are you thinking about this opportunity? And what's the production capacity required to meet this demand?
Phebe Novakovic: So we are working with our Navy customer to clarify timing and capacity and throughput. But at the moment, we have no particular insight, not really deferring to the Navy on and the timing and specificity of their long-range planning?
Kristine Liwag: And if I could sneak another one, maybe switching to combat. Look, it seems like the Army is pushing significantly to ramp artillery production, particularly the 155-millimeter shells and planning to double monthly production to about 24 per month by year-end. And then increasing production 6x over the next 5 years. How are you thinking about this opportunity? And again, do you see -- what do you need to do in order to meet this demand? Should it materialize? And are you seeing the orders come through?
Phebe Novakovic: We have seen the orders come through. And we do not yet have out your clarity on the exact timing of the additional production, but we will see additional production. And because of the priority of the 155, I think the nation has learned a lot about 155 artillery shelf. So we've done a lot to increase production already, and we are quite confident that we can go even faster.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Akers from Wells Fargo.
Matthew Akers: I wanted to ask kind of a high-level question on pilots for biz jet. On the commercial side, lack of kind of staffing with standing like pilots and crews has been kind of a pacing item. What's your sense for business jets or your customers kind of better off in that respect? Or could that potentially be a bottleneck for biz jet as well?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, I think during the height of COVID, there was so much disruption at all labor markets that we may have seen some issue then. But frankly, it didn't impact us. We're not seeing anything at the moment that is impacting our ability to fly, our customers' ability to fly or frankly, flying hours.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays.
David Strauss: The G700 is in there. Is software validation, the pacing item still? And if so, how far are the way through that are you?
Phebe Novakovic: No, it is not. And we are in pretty good shape here with respect to our certification. And look, this is an extremely mature, safe and sophisticated aircraft. So we're working very closely with the FAA to ensure that they've got the proper resources here to execute the certification, but it is coming.
David Strauss: Okay. A quick follow-up. Jason, you mentioned 8 resumptions of the AJAX payments. Can you update us on kind of the schedule for the liquidation there? How you expect that to play out and also on the Canada program?
Jason Aiken: Yes. So obviously, it was a positive development to see the payments resume here in the first quarter as we expected. The path forward with the customer is an ongoing discussion, we've worked through the revised schedule for the program. But some of the other particulars around milestone payments and progress on that schedule are still in the works. So it would be probably remiss of me to get out ahead of that.  In terms of the Canadian program, things are continuing to proceed well. That customer for the past 3-plus years has paid on time as per that schedule we negotiated. And so a couple more payments to come this year. And then really, what you can think about it is the entire arrears that we were dealing with some 2, 3 years ago will have been paid down and will be in a normal program cadence and schedule at that point, so by the end of this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets.
Kenneth Herbert: I just wanted to see -- I wanted to see if we could put a finer point on the Aerospace margins in the second quarter with supply chain issues and other timing around the certification and prebuild. Is it -- or second quarter margins expected to be similar to first quarter or was first quarter expected to be the trough for the year?
Phebe Novakovic: I think you may need to think about the second quarter being our lowest quarter and then with a very steep and executable ramp-up in third -- third and fourth quarter, I tried to give you guys an awful lot of color in the remarks about the puts and takes on all the margins with respect to Aerospace. But we -- we'll get through the second quarter. And frankly, these first 2 quarters are aberrational in terms of Gulfstream margins, and then we ought to see nice pickup in third and fourth quarter.
Kenneth Herbert: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, just considering the roughly 100 aircraft implied in the guidance for the second half deliveries and the supply chain issues, are you having at this point to maybe look at second sources? Or is there anything else you're doing now? Obviously, it's very late in the game, but to maybe improve or do you further derisk the supply chain beyond just the execution?
Phebe Novakovic: So we've been doing that for some time. As you all know, the supply chain on the Aerospace side has been taxed for quite a bit of time. So they were not taking any new actions that we haven't already executed, and we're just ramping up some of those actions as we -- in the first quarter and then as we go into the second.  But we have, as I said earlier, a very clear line of sight into the third and fourth quarters and the majority of these suppliers fully anticipate getting better. And we'll work with the remaining ones to ensure they've got the resources to execute the contract.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein: Maybe just a quick question, maybe 2. What are the synergies so far from merging the 2 businesses in kind of mission Tech? How has that gone?
Jason Aiken: So keep in mind, Ron, when we talk about merging those businesses, they still remain 2 independent and stand-alone operating units within our model. So not really anything to think about from a cost synergy perspective, I think the way to think about that is more of a revenue synergy point of view in that what we talked about is -- those 2 businesses are seeing a real convergence on a number of fronts within their markets, what their customers are interested in procuring in terms of end-to-end solutions that include the IT service side, software solutions as well as hardware as well as where their competitors are going in the market to address those demands.  So bringing those 2 businesses together has put us on a good footing to address that market and those demands. And that's what we're seeing, and you're seeing that in the positive order performance in the quarter and book-to-bill, capture rates, win rates and so on. So all of that gives us good confidence in terms of the trajectory of the outlook that we see for each of those businesses.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-on. How much of the free cash flow in the quarter can be attributed to AJAX?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So we have factored the net of payments to the supply chain, which has been very patient through this whole period into our estimates for the year.
Jason Aiken: Yes. So I want to make sure I understood your question correctly. It was a roughly GBP 480 million payment that was received. And to Phebe's point, that the net impact of that after paying out supply chain elements on the program, all of that's factored into the outlook that we have for the year. So that 105-ish percent conversion rate for the year that we talked about is now intact and all that much more certain based on the activity in the first quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global.
Peter Skibitski: The issues on the Virginia supply chain, it seems like it's been a little bit of a black box. So just -- I was wondering if I can get more detail. Does it relate to multiple suppliers? And can you give us a sense of what parts are involved? And then are we feeling good that as the mix shifts to the Block 5 that margins will improve there?
Phebe Novakovic: So it's multiple suppliers, some large and some small. And we have, again, continued to work with the Navy to address the challenges that they all have faced. And even though you have different sized businesses, many of them have been confronted with the same labor dysfunctions that we saw coming out of COVID. The Navy has been providing as well as the Congress been and providing funding to address some of the challenges within the industry -- some Marine industrial base, and we're hopeful that over time, that will resolve.  And we'll continue to see, I believe, improvement as we get into Block 5 and the supply chain stabilizes, but we've got ways to go there. And I think importantly, and this is the way we certainly think about it, Electric Boat just has to get better and faster to overcome any unexpected additional future supply chain challenges that may hit us. But we're not going to get into listing parts. This is an enormous supply chain. You can imagine with thousands of suppliers all over the nation.
Peter Skibitski: That's fair. And kind of one follow-up Phebe. How is the -- how are you judging the pace of hiring and the labor risk kind of through the midterm at EB, just given the kind of the huge increases in volume that are required there?
Phebe Novakovic: So again, coming out of COVID, I think we all felt a little bit of the labor constraint. But one of the reasons that we saw increased revenue in this quarter was extremely strong throughput coming out of as a result of robust hiring that they have executed and the training of those workers so that they hit the ground running, and we're able to have additional -- execute additional throughput up at So we consider that a good bellwether for our ability to continue to hire to meet our needs.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Melius Research.
Robert Spingarn: Phebe, Combat has been discussed throughout the call, but just a couple of quick things. Would you -- is it fair to assume that the book-to-bill will continue to be above 1 for this year and beyond, just given the strength? And then the second part of this is, as armament munition sales grow will they be margin accretive or dilutive to the overall segment?
Phebe Novakovic: So when you look at historically Combat orders, they tend to be pretty lumpy. I think the important way to think about it is the underlying credit could exist, let's say, it is an increasingly insecure and threat-driven environment, and that will drive additional orders, when those execute, will be a little bit lumpy, but we have -- we expect to see a continued demand, including on the munition side. But we have planned in -- for our plan this year, we've executed, we've anticipated margins that are pretty consistent with what they've been doing. It's just executing, operating, ensuring that we've got operating leverage, including on these new facilities that we're putting in place. But recall, this is a group that has extremely strong operating leverage and based on their efficiency and blocking and tackling on the shop floor. So we'll expect to see margins continue.
Howard Rubel: And operator, we'll take this one last question, please, and then we'll wrap up the call.
Operator: Certainly, your final question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. So Phebe, I'm still a little confused about your statement that Q2 earnings should be the lowest because pretty clearly, it looks like Marine should be better absent the VCM charge. Combat usually is a little better. GDIT is stable. And you've highlighted Aerospace, but the volume is going to be higher than it was in the first quarter. Margins given where the volume was actually looked pretty good in the first quarter. So it would seem to imply a pretty steep drop-off in margins. Could you give us some color in terms of what is creating that situation? And is that something we should be worried about will continue in the third and fourth quarter?
Phebe Novakovic: I tried to be pretty clear that we do not anticipate any -- at Gulfstream, the margin performance in these 2 first quarters replicating in third and fourth quarter. In fact, we see a fairly strong ramp to increase margins. These margins are aberrational and we do expect some additional perturbations on the supply chain and out of station work Gulfstream as well as mix issues.  With respect to Marine systems, it's material timing between first and second quarters. And in technologies, it's transitioned from mature programs that are winding down and being replaced by some follow-on new starts. So in each one of these groups, we are seeing a convergence of in the quarter, particularly lower margins and lower earnings and sales than we typically see. We usually have a steady build through the year. This is rather, as I said, aberrational, but we'll get through this. And importantly, we don't see these issues leading into third and fourth quarter, we anticipate a very strong third and fourth quarter, and that is unchanged.
Howard Rubel: Thank you for joining our call today. And as a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the first quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Q4 2022 Conference Call. All participants will be in listen only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full year 2022 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With my introduction complete, I’d turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.58 per diluted share on revenue of $10,850 million, operating earnings of $1,230 million and net earnings of $992 million. Revenue is up $559 million or 5.4% against the fourth quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $41 million or 3.5%. Net earnings are up $40 million or 4.2% and earnings per share are up $0.19 to 5.6%. So, the quarter-over-quarter results compare very favorably and are in most respects consistent with our forecast and sell side consensus. The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $876 million or 8.8%, operating earnings by $129 million or 11.7%. Net earnings by $90 million or 10% and EPS by $0.32, a 9.8% improvement. As promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest for the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings per share, operating margins, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $39.4 billion, up 2.4%, net earnings of $3.4 billion, up 4.1% and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.19, up $0.64, a 5.5% increase. So overall, the year was also reasonably consistent with our forecast and modestly better than the sell side. It was a very solid year in a difficult environment. Let me ask Jason to provide detail on our overall order activity, very strong backlog and cash performance in the quarter and the year.
Jason Aiken: Yes. Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were once again a very strong story with a 1.2:1 book-to-bill ratio for the company for the fourth quarter and a 1.1 times for the full year. Order activity in the Marine and Aerospace groups led the way. We finished the year with a total backlog at an all-time high of $91.1 billion and total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts of nearly $128 billion. I should note that foreign exchange rate fluctuations continued to be a headwind, reducing year-end backlog by nearly $600 million with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter and the year. It was another solid quarter with operating cash flow of $669 million, which brings us to $4.6 billion of operating cash flow for the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was nearly $3.5 billion, a cash conversion rate of 102%, slightly ahead of our target for the year of 100% of net income. As discussed on previous calls, Gulfstream enjoyed particularly strong cash performance throughout the year on the strength of its order activity and the Technologies Group once again delivered outstanding cash performance. That said, when we talked with you in October, we discussed three potential constraints to cash in the fourth quarter; the pending outcome of congressional action on the tax treatment of R&D expenditures; the timing of resumption of cash collections on the Ajax program in the UK; and an anticipated uptick in capital expenditures as we progress through our ongoing facility investments. As it turns out, the Congress did not act to remedy the requirement to capitalize R&D costs, we did not receive any payments from the UK, though we now expect payments to resume this quarter, and our capital investments were in fact elevated, consistent with expectations. I'll discuss that in more detail a little later in the call. The net result was a lighter fourth quarter from a free cash flow perspective but slightly better than we had expected and rounds out a very strong year in terms of cash performance despite the headwinds I discussed. I should also point out that free cash flow per share has grown at a 22% compound annual growth rate from 2019 through 2022.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segment, paying modest attention to the quarter-over-quarter sequential and annual comparisons that are rather straightforward and set out in the press release. First, Aerospace. The story in aerospace is found in the sequential and year-over-year improvement as well as a continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, along with the overall strength of Gulfstream service business and the continuing improvement of Jet Aviation. In the quarter, Aerospace had revenue of $2.5 billion and earnings of $337 million. This represents a 4.4% increase in revenue and an 8% increase in earnings on a sequential basis. For the full year, revenue of $8.57 billion is up $432 million from the prior year, even though we delivered only one more aircraft than we did in 2021. The increase in both revenue and earnings was driven by higher service revenue at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. Earnings were also helped by somewhat higher margins on delivered aircraft. Fourth quarter revenue and earnings comparison on a quarter-over-quarter basis aren’t as attractive because three aircraft we plan to deliver in the fourth quarter slipped into the first quarter this year. Gulfstream had 38 deliveries in the quarter when we had planned to deliver 41. As a result, Aerospace revenue and earnings are somewhat less than anticipated by the sell side for the quarter and for the year, but generally consistent with our forecast. I should also point out that Aerospace margins improved consistently quarter-over-quarter throughout the year. Aerospace demand remained strong. The book-to-bill was 1.2 times in the quarter and 1.4 times at Gulfstream alone. Orders in the quarter were $3 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the third quarter. The aerospace book-to-bill for the year was 1.5 times. To give you a little more color, Gulfstream received 430 new aircraft orders over the past two years, over 400 net orders after default and backlog adjustments as a result of the settlement of a case in arbitration. All said and done, aerospace backlog is up 20% in 2022 and a staggering 68% over the past few years. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. At midyear 2022, we told you to expect revenue of about $8.6 billion and an operating margin of around 12.9%. We actually finished the year with a 13.2% operating margin. In short, we were spot on with respect to revenue and 30 basis points better on operating margin, which led to a $25 million more than forecast in operating earnings. With respect to G700 development, we estimate it will certify this upcoming summer but much depends on available FFA resources. So far, the effort has been very collaborative and is proceeding according to plan with no surprises. In summary, Aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and for the year. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2023 at Gulfstream and improved operating margin, but more about that as we get into guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet. Next, Combat Systems. After a relatively slow start to the year, Combat Systems finished with a powerful fourth quarter. In fact, the fourth quarter of 2022 proved the highest revenue and earnings for Combat Systems in over 10 years. Revenue in the quarter was $2.18 billion, and it's up 15.5% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $332 million are up 18.1% on a 30 basis point increase in operating margin. OTS alone captured more than one-third of its revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter. The revenue growth was largely driven by Mobile Protected Firepower, Abrams for Poland and the large international order in Canada. OTS enjoyed higher revenue across all lines of business with particular strength in artillery rounds. Not surprising, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $391 million or 21.9% and earnings are up $61 million or 22.5% on the strength of a 15.2% operating margin. From an orders perspective, Combat had a very good year in 2022 with a book-to-bill of 1.1 times, driven by MPS, very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank as well as growing demand on the munition side of the business. By the way, Combat's annual performance is fairly consistent with the forecast we provided you earlier in the year. Revenue and operating earnings are up somewhat and operating margin is a little lower. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter, continued its history of strong margin performance and had good order activity and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Marine Systems. The Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2,970 billion is up 3.4% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was also up 7.2% sequentially and 4.9% for the full year. Operating earnings are up about 1% over the year ago, of less than 0.5% sequentially and up 2.6% for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group. A little perspective may be of assistance here. Marine Systems has grown revenue from $8 billion in 2017 to $11 billion in 2022, this is a 5.3% compound annual growth rate with an average increase of $600 million per year. Earnings have grown from $685 million in 2017 to $900 million in 2022, a 5.5% compound annual growth rate. In addition, Marine had strong orders in the quarter, generating a 2.2 times book-to-bill, including the receipt of a $5.1 billion contract modification to Colombia. Our forecast to you in July of last year anticipated revenue of about $10.8 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $896 million. We came in above that for revenue, a little lower on the predicted operating margin and right on the forecasted earnings. So, Jason is going to give you a little color on the Technologies Group, his new responsibility, provide a bit of perspective on balance sheet, other income and expense items, and I will close with our outlook for 2023.
Jason Aiken: The Technologies Group as a whole had a very strong finish to a solid year and a very challenging operating environment. Revenue in the quarter of $3.25 billion was up 9.3% over the prior year and up 6% sequentially. Operating earnings of $340 million were up about 2% over the fourth quarter of 2021 and sequentially, were up an impressive 19%. The main driver of the fourth quarter performance was Mission Systems' ability to overcome some of the logjam in its supply chain and deliver some of the product that was held up at the end of the third quarter. While these issues have not been completely resolved, the fourth quarter performance gives us good reason for optimism that they're starting to see their way through this. For the year, revenue of $12.5 billion was up just slightly from 2021. Breaking that down, GDIT once again grew in the low single digits, up 1.6% after 2.2% growth in 2021. Mission Systems was down 2% despite the strong end to the year. Earnings for the year of $1.23 billion were down 3.8% on a 40 basis point contraction in margin to 9.8% as a result of the mix shift between product and service revenue as GDIT reported its highest margin since the CSRA acquisition and its highest ever earnings, but Mission Systems was down for the reasons discussed. With respect to backlog, the Technologies Group had a solid year, notwithstanding an ongoing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. GDIT received over $11 billion in awards during the year, almost 20% higher than 2021, representing more new work than any year since the CSRA acquisition. And Mission Systems finished the year with a 1.1 times book-to-bill and a capture rate in excess of 80%, putting them in a good position to emerge from the supply chain headwinds they've been facing. With that, I'll turn to some of the financial particulars before turning it back over to Phebe to give you our guidance for 2023. Starting with capital deployment in 2022. Capital expenditures, as I noted, were elevated in the fourth quarter at $494 million or 4.6% of sales. That brings us to $1.1 billion for the full year. At 2.8% of sales, full year capital expenditures are slightly higher than our original expectation due strictly to timing. We expect capital expenditures to start to step back down below 2.5% in 2023 and continuing to trend towards historic levels. We also paid $345 million in dividends in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to $1.4 billion, and we repurchased approximately 440,000 shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to over 5 million shares for the year for $1.2 billion at just under $226 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $50 million in 2022 and we expect that to increase to approximately $200 million in 2023. This includes a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, which was made this month and fully funds the plan that had a funding gap of more than $500 million within the past two years. Concurrently, we shifted the investment mix to hedge the plan's $2 billion of liabilities, thus eliminating any funding risk associated with market volatility or discount rate fluctuations. However, as a result of the change in investment mix, our pension income will be lower in 2023. Following this derisking activity, we expect our corporate operating expense for 2023 to be approximately $140 million and our other income to be approximately $80 million, a combined reduction of roughly $125 million in nonoperating noncash income from 2022. Speaking of pension income, the fourth quarter had higher than anticipated other income as we benefited from higher discount rates for measuring liabilities on our nonqualified pension plans, which are mark-to-market at the end of the year. We also repaid $1 billion of fixed rate notes in the fourth quarter. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of over $1.2 billion and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down approximately $600 million from last year. We have $1.25 billion of debt maturing in 2023. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $364 million. That compares to $93 million and $424 million in the respective 2021 period. Pending our decisions with respect to the scheduled debt maturities, we expect interest expense in 2023 to remain essentially consistent with 2022. Turning to income taxes. We had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16%, consistent with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings. The sum total of these below-the-line items versus the comparable levels in 2022 is a net negative impact on 2023 diluted earnings per share of $0.63. And finally, with respect to our outlook for free cash flow, following a strong 2022, we expect cash conversion in 2023 to be better than 100%, roughly in the 105% range, assuming the resumption of Ajax receipts in the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. So, let me provide our operating forecast for 2023 with some color around our outlook for each of the business groups and then a company-wide roll-up. In 2023, we expect Aerospace revenue to be around $10.4 billion, up between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. Margin is expected to be up 140 basis points to 14.6%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 145, up a little over 20%. This is all consistent with the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of 2021 and at the end of Q2. In Combat Systems, at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be down slightly in 2023, following a modest decline in 2022 with a return to low single digit growth later in our planning horizon. Since then, the threat environment has clearly changed. Continuing the better-than-expected performance in 2022, we expect the group to hold steady again in '23 with revenue of $7.3 billion and operating margin once again towards the high end of their reliable 14% to 15% range at 14.7%. The improved outlook is a result of strong order activity we saw in 2022, including the MPF Award and growing international demand, particularly the tank order in Poland, which came in sooner than had been anticipated. We're seeing demand signals resulting from the war in Ukraine, but we've only just begun to see that manifest in our backlog at this point. To the extent those demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue in the latter part of the year, particularly in our armaments and munition business. As I noted earlier, Marine Group has been on a remarkable growth journey, averaging $600 million a year. Our outlook of $400 million to $500 million per year over time remains unchanged. However, the supply chain constraints of the Virginia program will drive some annual variability this year. As a result, the group's revenue for 2023 will remain essentially flat at $10.9 billion as well their operating margin rate at 8.1%. We anticipate a return to growth in 2024 and 2025 at around $600 million a year. We expect revenue in the range of $12.5 billion to $12.6 billion in the Technologies Group. To give you a little color behind this outlook, GDIT will continue to grow at a low single digit pace consistent with the past two years. Mission Systems, however, will be challenged from a revenue perspective, particularly in the first half of the year as they work through the lingering supply chain issues they've been dealing with for the past 18 months. As a result, their revenue will be down slightly compared with 2022. The resulting shift in the group's revenue mix, with stronger service activity but lower hardware volume was yield in operating margin in the 9.5% range, sustaining their industry leading performance, albeit slightly lower than 2022. So, for 2023, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $41.2 billion to $41.3 billion of revenue, an increase of almost 5%. We anticipate operating margin of 10.9%, up 20 basis points from 2022. This all goes up to a forecast range of $12.60 to $12.65 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect a pattern similar to what we've seen in recent years with sequential increases in revenue and operating margins throughout the year. As always, this forecast is purely from operations. It assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady to avoid dilution from option exercises. Beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effective deployment of capital. Let me close with an observation. Our forecast comes from our operating plan. It is conservative as it must be in this environment of unpredictable financing of the government. However, the threat environment suggests increases in defense spending. In short, I see more opportunity than risk in our forecast. With that, I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&A.
A - Howard Rubel: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Myles Walton with Wolf Research.
Myles Walton: I was hoping maybe you could touch on a couple of things. One, Jason, your new role and how you sort of think about balancing the act between the CFO and the operating segment roles and responsibilities which you intend to focus on there. And then maybe on the capital deployment front for '23 at 105%, obviously, you've got a lot of excess cash. Should we expect you to pick up repurchase activity in '23 versus '22 or relatively similar?
Jason Aiken: Myles, I think with respect to your first question, looking at the new responsibility and that opportunity. First and foremost, it's important to remember that these businesses are run by two excellent and accomplished presidents. And frankly, I have the highest level of confidence in them and their teams. When I look back over recent history in this role, Chris Marzilli, really helped steer this business through a period of remarkable change and transformation, not to mention COVID. And I don't think as I look ahead that this market is going to become any less dynamic. So I think the focus really is on continuing to make sure that the businesses continue to focus on their bottom line, earnings and cash as always but frankly, also finding our way to a sustainable top line growth trajectory, and that will really be the emphasis. In terms of balancing the two, I'm humbled and honored to have this dual responsibility, fortunately entering my tenth year in the role as CFO. So I feel confident about the ability to handle both at the same time.
Phebe Novakovic: So with respect to our capital deployment, we'll continue to invest in our business where prudent. We'll continue to maintain our dividend and we'll repurchase shares accordingly. So I don't see any big change in the priorities at least for our execution.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Phebe, could you touch on -- you mentioned three deliveries that slipped out. Was that customer preference, was that supply chain related? And then it doesn't appear that you're going to -- your prior guidance was 148 deliveries this year, now you're talking 145. So it doesn't seem any makeup there. And then last thing, the 170, I think you forecasted for '24 deliveries. Does that still hold?
Phebe Novakovic: So let me go in order. We had, as I noted, three airplanes have slipped into this quarter. One was simply an issue that we just couldn't get it completed in time and two of them were customer preferences for international deliveries. With respect to the production next year, we are confident that we can make that and our trajectory going forward past this year remains the same. So directionally and we're right on track, and we're comfortable we get there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Marine and the supply chain challenges at Electric Boat. And specifically, what we should be looking for in terms of any particular metrics, whether it's hiring or deliveries or certain milestones to get a sense that things are firming there and kind of also what the risk is of further deterioration in schedules.
Phebe Novakovic: So let's deconstruct that and I think we have to posit few truth. We went into COVID with scheduled variants on Virginia. Virginia is also about a third of the Electric Boat revenue. COVID had a profound impact on many aspects of our lives, but particularly lasting one on the workforce. We had labor discontinuities throughout the United States and we also experienced something that we had not anticipated abnormally large retirement of experienced workers. In a business that is heavily manpower dependent, these impacts had a disproportionate effect on additional schedule variants. We are working with the Navy who's been quite active and engaged in helping develop a plan and a really detailed action list on how to address these issues. And ship building and the supply chain are fixed by incremental improvements over time. So, what do we see at the moment? We see stabilization in the workforce. I think across the nation, we've got a little bit better labor dynamics than we did immediately coming out of COVID. We also have additional experience in what some of the challenges have been. So the way I look at it, this year will give us a bit of a chance to dig further see funds to the velocity of the material coming into Electric Boat. And that ought to be a good thing for all involved despite and notwithstanding the considerable issues around schedules. I would note that the Submarine Industrial base delivered two submarines last year, and we're going to deliver two more this year. So, I think maintaining that cadence of delivery is important. But in much of shipbuilding, milestones are difficult to identify really until you get the ship in the customers' hands. So, as I said, we're working very closely with the Navy to ensure that we could just get back some of that schedule variance on the remainder of the Block 4 ships and on the Block 5 ships.
Seth Seifman: And maybe just to follow up specifically on that. Most of the discussion -- our discussion today and then the trade press has been about Virginia. How's the Columbia schedule holding up?
Phebe Novakovic: So we're about 30% done on the first ship and we are ahead of the contract schedule.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter Arment: Phebe, maybe just to stay on Seth's line of question just on Marine. Maybe you could just -- there's been a lot written about just the industrial base, and you just mentioned it. How are you thinking about just maybe the CapEx profile and in particular, things start to get unveiled on [ACAS] (ph), what the plans might be there? Just should we expect any further step-up in CapEx [Technical Difficulty]?
Phebe Novakovic: Not with respect to ACAS. And I think we have, as I've said on earlier calls and to many of you in person, we'll just take our lead from our Navy customer on how they want us to respond to all of this. So this is really an intergovernmental series of discussions and agreements and we will, of course, support whatever the Navy plan is going forward.
Peter Arment: And just as a quick follow-up, just maybe just in general on the supply chain. You talked about the constraints in marine and some of the issues at Mission Systems. Has it gotten worse submission or do you think it's actually kind of stabilized? And this is just -- if is what it is, what's going on in the marketplace?
Jason Aiken: So I think with respect to Mission Systems, we have to really focus on what it is we're talking about here, which is really chips and microelectronics, right? So unlike some of the other parts of the business, which are heavily labor and availability of workforce driven. So this is really, obviously, for Mission Systems an issue that's impacting industries much broader than just us or us in the Aerospace and Defense side. And I think when these issues first surfaced, Mission Systems did a really nice job of developing workarounds, right? Finding alternate sourcing, certifying substitute parts and so on. So, all of those actions were predicated on the expectation that the supply chain would kind of come through this and get over the hump within, call it, a year plus or minus. But frankly, as we've continued to work our way through it, it's become clear that we're not always at the top of the priority list for some of these sources of supply. So when they saw the bottlenecks we were dealing with were going to persist somewhat longer than expected, the team really adapted to this new normal with a whole new set of tactics. That includes procuring key components with longer lead times anywhere from 12 to 18 or even 24 months, as well as working with key suppliers to improve the forecasting that we were giving them and the reliability of demand so that they could have confidence in where we were going and allocate additional capacity to us and our priorities. So, all of that is in place and underway. As you might imagine, some of those things take a little longer to yield results. So that's why we're expecting that to kind of come through in the second half of this year. But we do feel like they've got a good plan in place, they've taken great corrective actions, and we just need to see that all sort of roll out and to get to the other side of this, but it's likely to be toward the second half back into this year before that all takes hold.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: You've talked about this a little bit in your prepared remarks about the impact that the Ukraine could potentially have on Land Systems. Maybe from a bigger strategic point of view, it seems like in the past, the logic had always been the Army was a bill payer for the Navy and the Air Force. Is that -- are we learning a different lesson now out of the Ukraine and what kind of implications potentially does that have for your Land Systems business?
Phebe Novakovic: So, if you look at the services funding over, I'd say, in the modern air post World War II, the Army gets funded when they're tactical challenges and tactical problems, either a hot war, relatively cold war or preparedness, this is an issue where we've got both strategic challenges in which the Navy and the Air Force tend to get funded. And as I noted, the threat environment has materially changed. So that has driven increased interest in a number of Army and land forces capabilities. And as we've begun to see those show up in our in our backlog and in our order book, but we've got more room to grow and more room to go there as some of this demand converts into actual orders. So, when I think about what's going on in Europe, our European Combat Vehicle business has done quite well in securing a number of contracts, both historically but increasingly recently and on a -- what we expect on a going forward basis. They've been active in Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Luxembourg. By the way, I wrote all those down because that's a lot of countries. So I think the closer you are to the threat, the more urgent you feel your funding requirements. So all of which is to say, we have changed our expectations for Combat Systems growth. By the way, overarching all of this is a need to increase our ammunition and projectile output, and we've been working with the Army for the last three, four, five months on exactly that kind of plan. So as we've always posited, the threat environment really drives demand for defense products and we're seeing some of that now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason Gursky: Jason, I want to take the opportunity to ask you a question about the Technologies Group. I know you've been in the seat for just a small amount of time, but I'm maybe curious to know as you settle into your seat, the kinds of investments that you think you might want to make either in technologies or new products and services or in processes BD in order to accelerate revenue. Just kind of get your first impressions on the needs there in the group and what might change with you now taking over leadership of that group.
Jason Aiken: So I think the way to think about this group between GDIT and Mission Systems, technologies taken together, is that we currently are and have been for quite some time, in a model and of the capability set that a lot of the peer companies out there are trying to get to. That is a well balanced and comprehensive set of offerings between the traditional federal IT services offerings as well as cyber, hardware and other elements of that portfolio. And so I don't think we have to necessarily play catch up as much in that game. I think there's always opportunities to refine and enhance the portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, this is not going to stop being a dynamic environment. We are, as always, have continued to invest internally in new technology capabilities, that will continue to be the case. As you know, I'll say what I know Phebe would say if she were talking right now. We're not going to speculate about M&A. There's always the possibility for bolt-on acquisitions. I would note, by the way, since you brought up the point that since we acquired CSRA in 2018 and essentially transformed the face of this group with the size and capability of our federal IT services business. There have been -- if I look at GDIT's competitor group, call it, the top five or six main peers, there have been some 40 to 45 acquisitions in that space that those companies have taken on and we have not done any. We've done a couple of small bolt-ons in Mission Systems during that time, but nothing in GDIT space. And so it's interesting to see how the others are behaving in the aftermath of that activity and a lot of the consolidation that's happened in the industry. But I think we put ourselves in very good stead and we see a lot of a lot of others following suit. So I don't think there's a massive sea change in what we have planned ahead, but we'll continue to focus on maintaining our leading position in the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.
Cai von Rumohr: So you margin was up a little bit sequentially at Gulfstream and yet my understanding was you had some software warranty charges in the second and third quarter associated with the G500 and G600. So were there any other -- what were the reason the margins weren't a bit better there in Aerospace?
Phebe Novakovic: The margins are pretty darn good. We have performed what we had told you. And so we were pretty pleased with that. I would note that one of the headwinds is R&D. So the additional work that has been required from the airworthiness directive and the new FAA requirements as a result of the MAX have driven increased R&D. And we'll continue to see some of that and then that will begin to unwind. But I think those are very strong margins and better than we had anticipated in our guidance to you.
Cai von Rumohr: And Jason, the guide for Mission Systems margins is down over 200 bps from where you've been. Once things start to sort out, where do you see Mission Systems margins can go? Can they go back to where they were?
Jason Aiken: So I want to make sure I think you're saying technologies as a whole because we don't really give -- or business unit specific margin guidance within the group. But given what you're saying, I think if you look back to prior to the CSRA acquisition, when the IT services side of the business became, frankly, our largest business group and the lion's share, the sort of two thirds, if you will, or more of the technologies grew. We used to -- the combined margin of those businesses used to be in the, call it, the low double digit range, it's usually between 10% and 11% on a fairly consistent basis. Since we acquired CSRA, we've averaged over the past five years 9.8% margin for the group. So what we're seeing right now is really just a shift in the moment where we've had GDIT come through that significant integration effort for the first couple of years followed immediately on the footsteps of that with the impacts of COVID, they've really embarked on a nice steady trajectory now of low single digit growth for several years now, and we expect to see that continue. As Mission Systems in the moment is dealing with the supply chain issues that have been, I think, well addressed, their volume is down a bit. So what we're seeing in terms of the group's margin, aggregate margin, is really nothing more than a shift in the mix between the two. So that's with the increased service side of the business and the lower volumes on the product and hardware side of the business. So as Mission Systems comes through this and gets back on track to a growth level, which we do expect to see happen once they come through these issues, you ought to see the margin on an aggregate basis tick back up. And by the way, that's not -- shouldn't overlook the fact that GDIT on its own is continuing to improve and harvest its margins as it grows. I think I said before, they had their highest margin as a business since we acquired CSRA and their highest earnings contribution to the company ever. So everything, I think, is headed in the right direction, just got to come through the supply chain issues at Mission Systems and that will help influence the mix, and we ought to see a trend back up toward the 10% level over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.
Pete Skibitski: Just following on to Ron's question earlier on combat and that was standing the flat outlook for this year, but you talked about the international demand, and it seemed like Congress added quite a bit of money for Stryker and Abrams to the '23 budget. So can you give us any sense of kind of the CAGR that you think is a reasonable expectation after 2023 when things begin to -- or when the demand begins to actually convert for you?
Phebe Novakovic: So I think what we're looking at now is low single digit growth. So if we see anything over time that accelerates that, we'll certainly let you know that that's our best planning in the moment in consultation with our customer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe overall on the defense portfolio as a whole, all three segments. When you think about it, you're guiding the business flat on the top line perspective and EBIT as well. The budget is up 10 and you have some pretty good programs in there. How do you think about that delta and when it catches up to the budget and EBIT growth resumes?
Phebe Novakovic: So I think that's more in '24. One of the big issues there, as I said, is Virginia. But look, the way I look at the defense portfolio, we have an extremely strong backlog and now it's just a question of executing, executing across that portfolio. So I'm not too worried about growth on the defense side at all nor on the aerospace side. There is one thing that I think we're focused on, we should be focused on, and I neglected to mention this earlier. But with respect to execution, one of the things that we can do on Virginia and frankly at EB, in general, is to continue to improve our operating performance. That provides us more ability to cover some of the perturbations that are coming out of the supply chain. So I really think about all of this as execution. Growth comes when it comes. We've got the backlog to support it. And so I like the position we're in, frankly.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: And then if I could ask one more. I don't know if you provided it. Can you give us an update on the G700, G800 certification processes?
Phebe Novakovic: So we still expect the G700 to convert -- get certified this summer. And the G800 will be about six months after that, so we don't see any change in that. And the relationship has been going very well with the FAA. So we are continuing to look forward to finishing all the certification processes. Now that -- I will tell you that is outside our complete control, a lot of this is FAA resources and their ability to focus, given all the other demands that they have on them, but so far so good.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC.
Phebe Novakovic: I guess, we lost him.
Ken Herbert: Sorry about that. I was muted. I wanted to first ask, within Aerospace, really good growth in the services business. What's the outlook for services growth in '23 as part of the aerospace guide? And can you talk a little bit about investments that you're making in that business?
Phebe Novakovic: We expect low single digit growth in our service side. And we continue to invest prudently when we see the need for more service capacity. But at the moment, we're pretty -- nothing really outstanding in that regard. You've got the capacity to accommodate what we see as reasonable steady growth.
Ken Herbert: And just a quick clarification on the 700 certification this summer. As obviously, you commented you're working with the FAA closely and a lot of this is -- or some of this is out of your control. How would you characterize your visibility or sort of the ongoing risks around I guess, FAA capacity to support that? I mean do you feel like you're well through that risk retirement or is there still substantial uncertainty and risk associated with that summer time frame?
Phebe Novakovic: I think the FAA has done a good job managing its portfolio and a series of complex and multifaceted requirements. And so far, we are sticking to what we believe is a reasonable expectation for the certification.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Just a couple of quick ones from me, Phebe. First of all, on Ukraine, it looks like they're going to get Abrams tanks. At what point does capacity in some form or other particularly staffing become an issue? And then secondly, just for Jason, what sort of book-to-bill have you assumed in aerospace for 2023 in your cash flow guidance?
Phebe Novakovic: Staffing is not an issue here. There is plenty of capacity on the combat vehicle side, both tracked and wheeled. So to the extent that the US government intends to execute any contracts with respect to some of these bilateral agreements that they are developing, we can -- it's well within the capacity of the industrial base to accommodate.
Jason Aiken: And then, Rob, with respect to your second question, as it relates to aerospace book-to-bill, much like going into 2022, we've assumed a return to a 1:1 book-to-bill and that is one of the predicates for our cash flow forecast. So to the extent they outperform, obviously, that could provide some upside.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse.
Scott Deuschle: Phebe, you touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks. I was curious if you could comment a bit more in depth on the sales pipeline at Gulfstream and the latest trends you're seeing there, both from individual buyers and the corporate buyers. And then for Jason, I was just wondering if you could identify what the unbilled receivable balance was on Ajax at the end of the year and how much of that you expect to burn down this year?
Phebe Novakovic: With respect to our pipeline, I noted that it remains strong. I would also say that corporate America has been very active, both public and private companies, high net worth individuals. Europe remains slow. Mid East just picked up. Southeast Asia, let's say, not China, has been increasingly active. So we've got a good demand across all of our offerings in all of our aircraft.
Jason Aiken: And then on your second question, as it relates to the Ajax unbilled, that's at the end of the year, roughly $1.7 billion is where we stand right now. I don't want to get into the specifics of how much we expect to collect this year, that's part of ongoing discussions with that customer. But needless to say, as I mentioned in my remarks, we do have good reason to expect those cash receipts to resume before the end of this quarter. And so we'll start to see that unbilled balance come down.
Howard Rubel: Operator, this is Mr. Rubel. We'll take one more question, please and then we'll wrap the call up.
Operator: Our final question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.
Robert Spingarn: Phebe, going back to an earlier question on entry into service for 700 and 800. When would might we expect the R&D to decline, I don't know how much the 400 would use, and what would the incremental margins at Gulfstream look like once that happens? I imagine that's 24 or is it 25?
Phebe Novakovic: So I think we expect R&D to begin to go down at the end of next year. And look, we have Gulfstream is an extremely high performing operationally strong company. And so I think we have demonstrated incremental improvement in margins as our operating efficiency and discipline in our supply chain, engineering. And really on the shop floor, all of that has improved. So I think there's upward over time, margin opportunity, but we're not going to get into parsing specifics until we have good clarity. But we're very comfortable that we will improve steadily and repeatedly.
Robert Spingarn: And just a clarification on the FAA, you talked about it earlier. Are they still in the discovery process as they evolve their system after what's happened at peers over the past couple of years, or is there a set process that is in stone at this point?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, I think that that's a broader question than I'm able to answer. What I can tell you is that our relationship and working relationship with the FAA has matured significantly. And we think we all have a very clear understanding of what the new requirements are and how to execute them.
Robert Spingarn: Okay, thank you very much.
Howard Rubel: And thank you all for joining us today on this call. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics Web site for the fourth quarter earnings release, highlights presentation and outlook. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached later today on my office at (703) 876-3117. Operator?
Operator: There are no further questions at this time, which concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Please note, that this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Howard, please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter 2022 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With that completed, I turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.26 per diluted share and revenue of $10 billion. Operating earnings of $1.1 billion and net earnings of $902 million. Revenue is up, $407 million or 4.3% against the third quarter last year.  Operating earnings are up $18 million or 1.7%. Net earnings are up 4.9% and earnings per share are up 6.2%. So the quarter-over-quarter results compare favorably.  The sequential results are even better. Here we beat last quarter's revenue by 8.6%, operating earnings by 12.3%, net earnings by 17.8% and EPS by 18.5%. We beat consensus by $0.11 per share on somewhat higher revenue than anticipated by the sell side. Operating margin is about as anticipated. Most of the beat came from various other items including a lower tax rate than anticipated by the sell side.  On a year-to-date basis, net earnings are up $93 million or 4% and earnings per share are up $0.45 a strong 5.5%. We also had another very strong quarter from a cash perspective, net cash flow provided by operating activities is $1,280 billion. Free cash flow was $1.03 billion, a 114% of net income.  This follows a very strong cash performance in the first half. Order performance was good in the quarter across all segments and particularly strong at Gulfstream. You will hear more detail on cash and backlog from Jason a little later.  In summary, we enjoyed a strong quarter particularly so unlighted supply chain foreign exchange and inflation headwinds. So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments. First Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $2,350 billion and operating earnings of $312 million with a 13.3% operating margin.  Revenue is $281 million more than a year ago quarter up 13.6%. Operating earnings up $50 million more, up 19.1% on higher revenue and a 60 basis point improvement in margins. The sequential improvement is even better, revenue is up $480 million or 25.7% and operating earnings are up $74 million or 31.1%.  To be fair, the prior quarters revenue and earnings were somewhat lower as a result of the inability to deliver for Aircraft, due the airworthiness directive, which was fully resolved in the third quarter. From an audit perspective, this was yet another good quarter reflecting continuing strong demand. The Aerospace book-to-bill was 1.15:1, Gulfstream Aircraft alone had a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 and 1.9:1 year-to-date.  The first point and perspective since the end of the third quarter of 2021, Aerospace total backlog has grown $4,362 billion, to reach a very robust $19.1 billion. Despite apparent macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to experience a strong level of interest, good activity and a replenishing pipeline, Certainly, demand in the quarter was not as super-heated as prior quarters, but still the book-to-bill was very good against a significant increase in deliveries. Only time will tell about the macroeconomic impact, but we continue to see strong interest in Gulfstream aircraft and services. From a product perspective, the G500 and G600 of now seen FAA removed the wind-related airworthiness directive right on the schedule we had previously forecast. Almost the entire fleet had received the installation of the upgraded software by the end of the quarter. We have delivered 188 of these aircraft to customers through the end of the quarter. The G500, G600 together led the quarter in orders follow closely by G650. This is a very successful program with real market momentum. With respect to G700 development, the control law software validation is scheduled to begin FAA-type inspection authorization during the first week of November. We estimate we will certify this upcoming summer but much depends on available FAA resources. Gulfstream had 35 deliveries in the quarter. If everything goes as planned, we'll deliver 40 to 41 aircraft in the fourth quarter. I haven't said much about Jet Aviation, but suffice it to say, it performed well in the quarter with improving margins in its MRO activities. In short, Aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and should have an even stronger fourth quarter. Next, Combat. Combat Systems had very similar results on a quarter over year ago quarter basis, but with strong improvement sequentially. The Combat Systems revenue of $1.790 billion is up 2.5% from the year ago quarter. earnings are down 1.8% on a 60 basis point reduction in operating margin. Nevertheless, the operating margin in the quarter is an impressive 15.2%.  On a sequential basis, Combat Systems revenue is up $122 million or 7.3%, while operating earnings are up a very significant 10.6% on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin. Demand across the segment provided a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 with a large order for Abrams main battle tanks for Poland, orders for $370 million for munitions and ordinance, and in order for 39 labs from the Canadian government.  We also received our first order related to the Ukraine at our munitions business. All of this increases the Combat Systems total backlog to $13.8 billion. In summary, this was an impressive new business quarter with strong operating performance once again by the Combat Systems group. Next, Marine. Revenue of $2.8 billion is up $132 million, 5% over the year ago quarter. This quarter's revenue growth was distributed fairly evenly between electric boat and NASCO. Revenue is also up $118 million or 4.5% sequentially. Year-to-date revenue is up $415 million or 5.4%. Revenue in this group has been up for the last 20 quarters on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This is very impressive continued consistent growth. Operating earnings are $238 million in the quarter, up $9 million or 3.9% on operating margins of 8.6%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are $27 million or an impressive 12.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin. At Electric Boat, the Columbia first ship remains on cost and on contract schedule. The ship is more than 25% complete. NASCO had a particularly good quarter with improved TAO revenue and better margins across the board. From an orders perspective, Electric Boat received a large maintenance and modernization order for the USS Hartford. NASCO received orders for an additional ESB and 2 TAO oilers. As a result, book-to-bill was 1.1:1, leading to a $400 million increase in backlog. Throughout the group, we have a solid backlog of new construction and repair work. Our programs are also well supported in the FY '23 budget. In summary, revenue growth is clearly visible. And as I've said before, the real opportunity given the steady revenue visibility is margin improvement over time. Moving to Technologies. This segment has revenue of $3.71 billion in the quarter, down $49 million from the year ago quarter or 1.6%. The revenue decrease was fairly evenly split in dollar terms between Mission Systems and IT. Mission Systems suffered from nagging supply chain disruptions and the failure of some government customers to obligate funds for authorized and appropriated products. In the case of IT services, it was largely timing and program mix. Operating earnings of $285 million are down $42 million or 12.8% on a 120 basis point reduction in operating margin, exclusively attributed to Mission Systems and largely related to the issues impacting revenue. Total backlog remains relatively consistent over all comparative periods with a book-to-bill of 1:1 in good order prospects on the horizon. The pipeline remains very active at both businesses.  GDIT enjoyed another solid operating quarter with healthy earnings and particularly strong cash in part due to good results in the federal civilian division. While we continue to see procurement delays, GDIT's year-to-date wins exceeded full year 2021 awards in dollar terms. These wins highlight the nice momentum in the business as GDIT begins to realize the benefits from targeted investments in the technical differentiation of its offerings. And this, despite the more than $3.5 billion tied up in prolonged protest and nearly $17 billion pending adjudication at the end of the third quarter. On the people front, GDIT remains focused on attracting and retaining the very best technology talent. The culture of this business has created. One of empowerment, accountability and inclusivity is a clear differentiator and a fiercely competitive talent market. Mission Systems experienced a series of challenges in the third quarter, additional supply chain disruptions, inflation, labor availability and select intel programs and customer contracting delays. Many mission system customers have a serious shortage of contracting officers that have hampered their ability to execute on programs of record. In addition, quite understandably, customer focus has been redirected in some areas to meet the more urgent demands of the Ukraine. The business has offset some of the bottom line impact by productivity improvements and cost-cutting initiatives. They will make every effort to catch up in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, we anticipate these fact of life realities to continue for a while. I have more to say on that subject in a moment. That concludes my remarks with respect to a solid quarter for the entire company. So as we look toward the end of the year, we expect performance to be largely in line with the update to guidance that we gave you on the last call. As I just referenced, we expect technologies to fall short of our previous estimates, but we expect aerospace to run somewhat ahead of our previous forecast. All up, they should offset each other. In all other respects, our guidance remains the same. We stand by our previous EPS guidance. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Starting with our cash performance. It was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion. This was achieved once again on the strength of the Gulfstream orders and particularly strong cash performance from our Technology segment. This brings us to $3.9 billion of operating cash flow through the first 9 months of the year, which also includes the ongoing collections on our large international combat vehicle contract according to the contract restructure that occurred back in 2020. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was just over $1 billion for the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date, yielding a conversion rate of 137% through the first 9 months. The continued strong performance positioned us very well to achieve our target for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income. With respect to the status of the tax treatment of research and development expenses, I think everyone can sense that despite the broad-based bipartisan support for immediate expensing of these investments, the window of opportunity for action in 2022 is quickly closing. As we've said all throughout the year, if the Congress acts to defer or reverse the capitalization requirement, we would expect free cash flow for the year at or above 110% of net income. Looking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $255 million in the quarter or 2.6% of sales. That's up from last year, consistent with our expectation to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. For the first 9 months, we're at 2.2% of sales, but 2.5% remains our full year target, so obviously an implied uptick in capital investments in the fourth quarter. We also paid $345 million in dividends during the quarter, bringing the total deployed in dividends and share repurchases through the first 9 months to just over $2.1 billion. The net result at the end of the third quarter was a cash balance of $2.5 billion and a net debt position just under $9 billion, down over $1.5 billion from this time last year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $86 million, down from $99 million in the third quarter of 2021. That brings the interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $279 million, down from $331 million for the same period in 2021. At this point, we continue to expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $380 million, including the assumed repayment of $1 billion of notes that mature in the fourth quarter.  The tax rate in the quarter was 14.3%, bringing the rate for the first 9 months to 15.1%. This is consistent with our guidance last quarter to expect a lower rate in the third quarter and a higher rate in the fourth. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year, which, of course, implies a higher tax rate in the discrete fourth quarter.  One more comment on the tax front. The inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August included a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks. We don't expect either of these provisions to have a material impact on our financial results. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the third quarter with a 1.1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As mentioned earlier, Aerospace continued to have a strong order activity with a 1.2 times book-to-bill in the quarter and 1.6 times over the trailing 12 months. On the defense side, the combined book-to-bill was 1.1 times, with each of the segments achieving a book-to-bill of at least 1 times. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $88.8 billion, while total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $125.8 billion. The increase in backlog was particularly notable given a headwind from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $275 million in the quarter and $650 million year-to-date, with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems. Incidentally, the FX fluctuations also negatively impacted Combats revenue by $55 million in the quarter and $123 million in the first 9 months of the year due to the surging dollar versus the euro and the British pound. But for the FX headwind, the Combat Systems Group's revenue would have been up by 5.6% in the quarter and down only 3.9% for the first 9 months. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&A.
Howard Rubel: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first telephone question today comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Seth, please go ahead, you may begin. 
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much. Good morning. Sorry, Jason, to waste a question on pension here, but you guys are a little bit different than your peer group in terms of the way that you account for things. When we think about where interest rates and asset returns are year-to-date and we think about the income below the line next year, where that might migrate to you. And when we think about the cash impact if any, in terms of the contributions that you would expect. Can you give us an update on that?
Jason Aiken: Yes. As you said, Seth, we are somewhat different from most of the peer group in this regard. And as a result, right now, we're not expecting anything material from an income perspective on the pension front. Obviously, that's something we'll roll up as part of our full operating plan process here in the fourth quarter and give you more specific detailed guidance in January. But I think the bottom line is both from an earnings as well as from a cash perspective, we don't expect that at this point to be a material item.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Just to clarify, the $40 million or so of income below the line each quarter, that kind of continues?
Jason Aiken: Some version in that range. I don't have an exact number at this point. You can expect it to decline as you would modestly. But again, that's not 100% pension income there. It's a big piece of that is pension income on the commercial side of the business. So it should down take a little bit, but not in a material way.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Okay. And then maybe as a quick follow-up, we saw some news during the quarter about the Australian sub and the potential to do some work on that outside of Australia. And we all kind of know about the capacity constraints on sub building right now. Maybe could you talk a little bit about your thinking on that topic?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So we are driven entirely by the demand of our customer and the prioritization of our customers. So we're working with them, our U.S. Navy, to determine what the focus should be going forward. And as we work through these -- some of these capacity issues then how do we accommodate not only U.S. demand but potentially other demand.
Seth Seifman: Okay, great. Thanks very much. 
Operator: Our next question today comes from David Straus of Barclays. David, go ahead. 
David Strauss: Thanks, good morning. Phebe, were there any unusual costs at the Aerospace segment in the quarter related to the 500, 600 software fix?
Jason Aiken: Yes, David, we did have, I think you're aware, some customer accommodation related to the software issue, both in the second quarter and the third quarter wasn't material to the results, but that has been absorbed in the numbers that you see and is inherent in the improved margins that the group posted in the quarter.
David Strauss: Okay. And it's completely behind nothing lingering in Q4, Jason?
Phebe Novakovic: Right.
Jason Aiken: That's correct. It's behind us at this point.
David Strauss: Okay. Great. And a follow-up on free cash flow conversion. Given where you are year-to-date, I mean over 100% for the full year looks pretty conservative unless there's something unusual, I guess, from a working capital perspective that you're expecting in or baking in in Q4. Can you just elaborate on that?
Jason Aiken: Yes. As you point out, the cash flow has been particularly strong through the first 9 months. So as I said in the opening remarks, we're very comfortable with the 100-plus percent for the year. To be completely candid, there's probably some opportunity for some upside there. If I look at the things that we're monitoring, number one, to the first 9 months, we've had a significant benefit from working capital reduction. Some of that's timing. So some of that could turn in the fourth quarter. We'll watch that. The other big piece is, as I noted, we're still expecting or forecasting CapEx for the year to be in the 2.5% of sales range. So that implies a pretty meaningful uptick in CapEx in the fourth quarter. I'll acknowledge that often chased our CapEx forecast and rarely hit it. So there could be some upside opportunity there if we don't get everything in, in the year. But if we do that, that's a headwind to the fourth quarter. And frankly, the third item is something that everybody continues to monitor and that is we need to resolve our situation on the Ajax program. So those are some of the things we're monitoring for the fourth quarter. We come through all that. And certainly, to your point, we have some opportunity for some upside.
David Strauss: Thanks very much. 
Operator: Our next question today comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Ron, you may begin.
Ron Epstein: Good morning. Just maybe the supply chain question. It seems like you guys are navigating it really well. Most airplane companies today are having aren't going to deliver more than they thought they were going to deliver the opposite problem. So I guess my question for you is how is the supply chain going for Gulfstream? And then b, when you look at the defense business you have, you heard kind of across the sector, similar issues on chips and so on and so forth. How is it going there?
Phebe Novakovic: So we've had a fair number of supply chain challenges on the aerospace side, which we have accommodated heretofore. But supply chain remains a potential challenge going forward. And as we go through our planning process in the fourth quarter, we get a lot more clarity airplane by airplane of what the supply chain is able to do. But we have so far managed. There are, however, as you quite rightly note, a fair number of headwinds out there. On the defense side, we have accommodated most of the supply chain perturbations, except obviously in the Marine group. But most profoundly in the quarter and most impactfully is at Mission Systems. And while they had with a lot of the more pedestrian supply chain challenges, specialty chips continue to dog them and the additional delays that they experienced in the quarter were very, very hard for them, in fact, impossible for them to overcome. Mission Systems is a very high-performance organization, and they produced several high-value complex products that have experienced delays before, but again, even beyond some of the chip problems, some of the specialty products going into that production those production lines were also impacted. So the Mission System is credit. They have taken a lot of cost-cutting and restructuring initiatives to offset the margin impact and earnings impact of the revenue decline, but we're going to have to work through some of that. And so more to come as we look into the fourth quarter and then into next year.
Ron Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then maybe as a follow-on, on the labor side, what are you seeing across the businesses, right? We clearly hear from the Navy that they want to have more shipbuilders out there. But I mean what are you seeing across all the businesses you have in the portfolio in terms of skilled labor?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So there are some across the businesses, there are some specialty engineering and specialty fields that have had some headwinds on labor, but those are beginning to resolve in terms of manufacturing, we had some perturbation in -- we've had a lot of perturbation in the labor market, but felt that particularly at constant point, but that's beginning to resolve itself.  When you think about shipbuilding, shipbuilding is a very complex, high touch labor business. And when you have a nationwide perturbation in the labor market is going to be impacted. I mean while we kept open, not all of the supply chain did, but we also lost a number of experienced shipbuilders as well as experienced people manufacturing folks in the supply chain. So all of that at a higher level than we normally experience. And I don't think that we are alone in that. People took the opportunity in the middle of the pandemic to retire. So we've got to work through some of that.  But ultimately, we do not see and I think this is an important point here. We do not see labor as constraint for our revenue growth at the moment. Certainly not in the longer term.
Ron Epstein: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Rod Stallard of Vertical Research. Rod, please proceed.
Robert Stallard: Good morning. Steve, your comments suggest that we're finally seeing some of this strong defense demand turning into orders. But what sort of time line are you expecting for these orders to actually convert into deliveries.
Phebe Novakovic: You talking about combat?
Robert Stallard: Well, across the defense divisions, but firstly, combat. Yes.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. Let's talk about Combat because I think -- and then we can talk if you want a little bit about technologies. And before I get to combat, marine is pretty clear. The orders continue to be healthy. The revenue projection, while you have some quarterly lumpiness, it signifies nothing for the long-term growth.  With respect to combat, we saw a number of things in the quarter, primarily Stryker and Abrams as well as MPF is beginning to ramp up as in Poland. And we saw some munitions orders also related to the Ukraine. So I suspect that -- and if we parse through, we focus in on the Ukraine, what we anticipate that our U.S. Army customers telling us they want more ammunition and munitions. So we're working with them to ramp up production. In Europe, we've seen demand for bridges because frankly, a lot of water in Europe. And we've got a very nice business in Germany to provide river crossings at various widths and weight levels. And then we’re seeing -- beginning to see increases in vehicle orders and vehicle RFPs coming out, particularly, but not exclusively in the former Eastern block. So technologies is really, I think, a tale of two cities. GDIT has had good bookings. They grew last year. We anticipate them to grow this year. This is all about Mission Systems, as I think, tried to give you a fair amount of detailed color on what's impacting them. The demand for their high-value products is out there. It's just our -- the inability to deliver because of the supply chain is constraining some of the orders, but they're there. They're just waiting to be executed once we get through all of this, and we will, we will get through it.
Robert Stallard: So just to follow up on combat, and these orders you've had from Europe, for example, is there roughly a 12-month to 2-year lead time between the contract getting signed and actually GD delivering?
Phebe Novakovic: Completely depends on the product. Less so on the bridge side and it depends and again, less so potentially on the vehicle side, it just depends on the vehicle, and exactly what modifications or changes folks want. We're not looking at clean sheet vehicles. We're looking at changes to existing vehicles that we have updated consistently and throughout the years. So it will depend. I suspect a year, in some cases, 18 months. Certainly, I don't expect a whole lot more than that.
Robert Stallard: Yes, it was great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Wolfe Research. Myles, please go ahead. 
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I know that there's the $1 billion maturity coming in November, but curious maybe, Phebe, how you're thinking about capital deployment in a broader sense, obviously, cash flow coming in ahead of expectations. I think. Go ahead. 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, yes. No, no, no. And that's a very good question. Our capital deployment priorities remain the same. But let me give -- ask Jason to give you a little bit more color on the details.
Jason Aiken: Yes. I think the way to think about it, Myles, we've talked about the $1 billion coming due in November. We do plan to pay that down. When you think on the debt side, we'll have additional maturities coming up in 2023, and that's where we said we'll start to look, think back to the CSRA acquisition and the additional debt we took on, we would bring it down to a point where it's some undefined point in the future, we'd start to think about whether we've hit the right level or not. And I think when we get into next year, we'll start to have that conversation in a more substantive way in terms of decision making. When you look at the other elements, share repurchase, as you know, is always tactical and opportunistic. It was a very volatile market in the third quarter. So we were a little more hands off just kind of trying to see what -- where things shake out, but that doesn't change our long-term approach to share repurchase in a tactical and opportunistic way. And I think importantly, the dividend is always going to be there. You've always heard us talk about that, and we'll continue to expect to be on that trajectory that we've been on for the past quarter century, frankly. So as Phebe said, no changes in the deployment strategy. It will just be a matter of what's in the moment in a given quarter. And I think importantly, our cash flow performance and our liquidity resources afford to see optionality to address all of those priorities without having to forgo one for the sake of the other.
Myles Walton: And just a quick follow up, Phebe said, it’s the M&A market attractiveness. Is that improved become worse the same?
Phebe Novakovic: We're just not going to comment on M&A. So I think we can leave it at that. You want one more shot, one more question?
Myles Walton: No. I'll stay through. I don't want to get Howard Angry.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, that's a scary thing, Isn't it?
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. George, go ahead. 
George Shapiro: Yes. Jason, I wonder if I could pin you down a little bit as to how big a number of the software fixes were in the margin for Gulfstream in the quarter. Are we talking a few million dollars or something more?
Jason Aiken: George, I don't actually have a discrete number on the software fix. I mean, I have a sense of the overall R&D budget and that sort of fits into that context. So I think as David asked earlier in terms of impacts to aerospace in the quarter, you saw the nice margin improvement, frankly, even a little bit ahead of where we were expecting, which is why as Phebe alluded, we think we'll -- the group perform better for the full year. But even within those strong results in the quarter, we did have an impact, an adverse impact in terms of the accommodations we made with customers on the 500, 600 airworthiness directive. Again, that's fully behind us. And we are in a, at this point, sustained elevated R&D mode. Part of that was the resources that were diverted from the 700 over to the 500, 600 AD fix, and that will sustain through next year, as we've talked about as we continue towards certification of the 700 and then ultimately the 800. So I'll give you a little more color around that, but I apologize, I don't have a discrete number around the airworthiness directed fix.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then a quick one, Phebe, a usual question. There's a $59 million difference between the gross and the net bookings in Aerospace. Was that a cancellation? Was it FX related? Or if you can quantify that?
Phebe Novakovic: All of the above. I mean really absolutely immaterial.
George Shapiro: Okay. And let me sneak in one last one. 
Phebe Novakovic: You're risking Howard's ire. Go, George.
George Shapiro: I always got Howard's ire. That's okay. when you commented about your deliveries in '23 and '24, it presupposed the book-to-bill of 1. Obviously, we've run a lot better than that. So are you thinking of changing those delivery forecasts or just stay conservative with the delivery forecast that you have out there?
Phebe Novakovic: Not at the moment. We assumed 1:1, and at the moment, I don't see any reason to change that. But as we go through our planning process, to the extent that we need to modify it, we certainly will and we'll be very explicit about that in the fourth quarter.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Phebe Novakovic: Kristine. Hello?
Kristine Liwag: Sorry about that. You guys hear me.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes.
Kristine Liwag: Okay. Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And Phebe, on international defense sales, we're seeing changes in relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. With your foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia through Canada, how do we think about this evolving relationship potentially affecting your business?
Phebe Novakovic: We see no indication of that in a moment. You want to ask one more. 
Kristine Liwag: Yes, following up on what George was asking about on aerospace. I mean book-to-bill was at 1times at aerospace. We've seen this above 2 times in the past few quarters. But at the same time, the backlog is at record levels. Can you provide some color on the demand resilience you're seeing? Is this a demand from corporate customers, individuals? And then also, is there some sort of level of backlog where you're comfortable at so not to extend the duration of when people have to wait for their aircraft. Any color you could provide there would be really helpful.
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. So we -- let's take your question in the inverter. We always watch the delivery times for our aircraft to our customers. And so far, that's all been manageable. Well, just to remind you, starting in mid-February of last year, we frankly entered the hottest in notranic demand market that I've ever seen. And the order level in the quarter was by any measure, spectacular.  So we've seen strong U.S. demand, Fortune 500 Mideast, Southeast Asia. And our demand interestingly, and I think not surprisingly, our pipeline going into the fourth quarter looks very much like the pipeline going into the third quarter. So at the moment, we've got some pretty good visibility of what orders look like.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen. Cai, please go ahead. 
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much, and good results, Phebe. So how is the software accommodation split between the second and third quarter. And as we look going forward, with that out of the way, and presumably R&D flat to down and volume up, what should we look for about the margins in the fourth quarter and going forward?
Phebe Novakovic: So we'll see some margin upside, which we alluded to or about stated rather, in our guidance for the year. But the software fixes work almost entirely done by the end of the second quarter and the financial issue, it's about 50-50. So we're -- we like where we are. And frankly, you haven't asked this, but let me just give you a little bit of transparency around that. The transparency of the engineering resources that -- and the cooperation between the FAA and the Gulfstream was very strong and very apparent throughout that process. So we expect that kind of relationship to continue.
Jason Aiken: If I could add just 1 thing. Cai, there was a predicate in your question that R&D would be coming down, we don't yet expect R&D to be coming down. If you look through next year with the 700 and the 800 will remain at a sustained and potentially even elevated level next year. So I just want to make sure that point is also clear.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. Good point.
Cai von Rumohr: Excellent. And as a follow-up, if we turn to GDIT, you mentioned $3.5 billion in protest, $17 billion in bids awaiting. How does that compare with the second quarter? And given that they lifted the occupancy restrictions at DoD in the middle of September, have we seen a pickup in any of that flowing through to bookings?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, we have. But tell me again what the first part of your question was?
Cai von Rumohr: Well, you had $17 billion in business awaiting at $3.5 billion in progress.
Phebe Novakovic: Some of the protests have resolved to our favor. And these are -- when we say protest, these are items that we've won that have been protested. And we've got one in there that's got to be approaching the federal level of number of protests. So hopefully, we'll get through that in the fourth quarter. And I think there's -- it's down somewhat, as I said, because they've resolved. But we still see a fair amount of proposals in the decision-making cycle, which has, as we've said elongated. But even given that, GDIT continues to grow.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you, very much. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Herbert of RBC. Ken, proceed. 
Kenneth Herbert: Yes, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to first ask on the schedule for the 7 and the 800. Is it fair to assume that resources that were diverted from the 700 are now 100% back on that program? And in the last few months, considering issues, okay, great, considering issues on the 5 and 6 have been resolved. Are you seeing anything else from the FAA that could potentially put entry to service schedules at risk?
Phebe Novakovic: So as I said, we've cooperated very well with the FAA. We expect that to continue. I would note that we learned a lot in that process of how to work through the new software requirements from the FAA. I think that, coupled with the fact that the G700 is the most mature aircraft to enter the FAA certification process as a result of its software system and considerable and successful testing that preceded FAA review. We see -- we're sticking with our at the moment with our summer 2023 estimate. But look, when we give you sort of our best guess on when the certification is. That's a result of a lot of things that we control and that we can talk about with certainty. But ultimately, this is an FAA issue, and it's the availability of their resources, and they are the regulator and they're going to control it. So we've always tried to be transparent about that, but recognize that the U.S. government controls ultimately the pace.
Kenneth Herbert: Okay. Very helpful. And if I could, just 1 quick follow-up. On the defense side, how would you look at the risk of your business if for whatever reason, we have a continuing resolution that extends into calendar '23?
Phebe Novakovic: At the moment, we don't see a particular risk. And if we get 3 to 4 quarters in the entire year of a CR, which I find in this threat environment, very difficult to imagine. And we'd have to come back at you. But nothing we hear would suggest that it's the desire of Congress to do that.
Kenneth Herbert: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Doug, please go ahead. 
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. When you look at the demand you're seeing at Gulfstream right now, can you give us kind of a picture of how this looks? And what I mean is we're seeing a lot of things such as first-time customers going straight to large cabin jets, perhaps shifts in international versus U.S. Can you give us a picture of what that outlook is today for you? And has that changed some over the past couple of years?
Phebe Novakovic: So I think you and I, a couple of years ago, had a discussion about structural versus cyclical change. And I still think it's premature to see any to declare that there's been a structural change. We've certainly seen some increase in first-time buyers, but that was in part because a lot of wealth was created during the pandemic. The higher the pandemic. So I don't have exact data about what's in the pipeline, but I can imagine that it will be much different than this quarter, which is heavy U.S. Fortune 500, again, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
Doug Harned: And then just switching over, earlier when you talked about munitions, this is something that also looks like -- it looks like there's a lot of potential growth here. How do you think about this? I mean, I think of it as a high-margin business for you within Combat and potential to have orders well beyond that 3.70 that you got this quarter?
Phebe Novakovic: So -- and I think I may have alluded to this in my remarks that, our customer has expressed an interest in increasing that demand. So we're working with them on increasing production. But I think your predicated about a high-margin business is not quite based. In fact, we are -- OTS where we do all of this work is a high-performance organization with respect to operating leverage. But that comes from a very wide and vast portfolio. So we do okay, but I wouldn't say that they were additive.
Doug Harned: So you don't think of it as a higher-margin business. I just thought traditionally, it was a higher-margin business than perhaps some of the other parts of combat vehicles, and that's not the case?
Phebe Novakovic: OTS, on occasion, will be a higher-margin business, but that's largely about mix, and it's not driven by 1 particular line of business. They've got an awful lot of contracts and the high-velocity contract turnover. So I think that's how you should think about them.
Howard Rubel: Thanks, Doug. Lisa, we'll take one more question, please. This will be our final.
Operator: Our final question today comes from Scott Deuschle of Credit Suisse. Go ahead. 
Scott Deuschle: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, I think ROIC is something that you've historically been very focused on. And honestly, it's held up really well here despite the capital that you put in the business. So just curious, as you get past the bulk of the CapEx phase of marine working capital comes out of the business and you have margins reflected aerospace? Where do you think ROIC can go over the next few years?
Jason Aiken: It's a great question. Obviously, as we've been in this period of extended investment, you'd expect to see ROIC become a little bit muted as a result. And we saw a little bit of a downtick in that during that investment period. But as we emerge having had essentially the investment period behind us. To your point, we absolutely expect to see ROIC back on decline. We'll see that this year, and we expect to see it next year and beyond. So our targets over the long term ought to be back in the range as we were in prior to the investment period we entered into a few years ago, and that's what you should expect as well.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then Jason, does the recently announced facility expansion of Savannah, does that have any impact to the prior guidance you gave on '23 CapEx? Or was that embedded in the 2% figure you previously talked about? Thank you.
Jason Aiken: Yes, that's all embedded and now look we've given previously. So no change to those projections.
Scott Deuschle: Great. Thank you so much. 
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I'll hand back to the management team for any closing remarks.
Howard Rubel: Thank you all for joining us today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for both our earnings release and, of course, our highlights presentation. If you have any other questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you all for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brica and I will be your event specialist today. [Operator Instructions] I now have the pleasure of handing the call over to our host, Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. So, Howard, please go ahead. 
Howard Rubel: Thank you operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2022 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With that completed, I would like to turn the call over to our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken. 
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Howard. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. Before we get started, I want to let you all know that our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic isn't able to join us this morning. She recently came down with COVID, but not to worry she's on the mend and doing well, but she's asked me to cover today's call. With me is Bill Moss, our Vice President and Corporate Controller who will cover some of the financial particulars that I would normally address. So, with that let's get into the results. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $2.75 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $978 million, earnings before taxes of $923 million, and net income of $766 million. Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year, but operating earnings were up $19 million. Earnings before taxes were up $42 million and net earnings were up $29 million. Earnings per share were up $0.14, a 5.4% increase. To be a little more granular, we enjoyed revenue increases at Aerospace and Marine Systems offset by declines at Combat Systems and Technologies. We also had margin improvement in three of the four segments which led to higher operating earnings and earnings before taxes against the year ago quarter. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.03 per share on somewhat lower revenue, but somewhat higher operating margin than anticipated by the sell side. This led to the modest earnings beat. On a year-to-date basis, revenue, for all practical purposes, was even with last year's first half. Similarly, operating earnings were essentially flat, but earnings before taxes were up $46 million, net earnings were up $51 million, and EPS was up $0.25, almost 5%. In the quarter, free cash flow of $435 million was 57% of net income. Cash flow from operating activities was 86% of net income. This was pretty good in light of the powerful first quarter cash. To that point, year-to-date free cash flow of $2.3 billion was 151% of net earnings. In summary, we had a solid quarter from an earnings perspective and the year-to-date results give us a solid start to the year. So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Bill add color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash and then I'll provide updated guidance. I'll try to keep my remarks brief to leave ample opportunity for questions. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.9 billion, operating earnings of $238 million and a 12.7% operating margin. Revenue was $245 million more than the year ago quarter or 15.1%, largely as a result of higher service center sales at Gulfstream and higher service volume particularly FBOs at Jet Aviation. Operating earnings are up $43 million or 22.1% on a 70 basis point improvement in margins. So increased sales volume coupled with improved margins leads to very good operating leverage. We captured improved revenue on only 22 deliveries. We didn't deliver four G500 and 600s that were scheduled to deliver in the quarter. They've been deferred at customer request to the third quarter awaiting removal of the FAA wind directive. However, nine G500 and 600s in fact were delivered to customers in the quarter. So we delivered nine of the 13 that were planned in the quarter. From an order perspective, we did very well once again. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 2:1. Gulfstream aircraft alone had a book-to-bill of 2.7:1 even stronger if expressed in unit terms. As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February 2021 and continued on to the second quarter of this year. The pipeline and sales activity remain strong as we enter this quarter. The Farnborough Air Show was a good one for us. From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continue to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis and quality is superb. We're making good progress in the flight test of the software update for landing and high winds and expect removal of the FAA directive in mid-September. You may recall that last quarter we advised you of a risk of a three to six month delay for certification of the G700 to second quarter 2023, as a result of the time-consuming work on model-based software validation. As a result of the flight sciences engineering resources we needed to redeploy onto the work related to the G500 and 600 FAA limitation on landings and high wind conditions, the risk to the G700 schedule has become a reality. As we've previously advised, this will not adversely impact our financial plan for 2022 and 2023. We feel confident that the G800 will follow the G700 by about six months. Looking forward, we've planned 123 deliveries for the year and we fully expect to do just that. Turning to Defense. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.7 billion, down 12.3% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was impacted by Ajax at both Land Systems and ELS bomb bodies at OTS and some program mix. Operating earnings of $245 million were off against last year's quarter by 7.9% with a 70 basis point improvement in margins. Operating margin was a strong 14.7%. On a sequential basis, revenue was very similar to the first quarter, but operating earnings were up 7.9% or $18 million on a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, Combat Systems revenue was down 10.2% and operating earnings were down only 7.5% on a 40-basis point improvement in margins.  In June, Land Systems was awarded the Mobile Protected Firepower contract the first all-new combat vehicle for the army in decades. The initial award for LRIP-1 was $410 million for 25 vehicles. The program of record for LRIP is $1.1 billion for 95 vehicles through 2026. The entire program requirement is 500 vehicles for more than $5 billion. The program fills a critical gap in the Army's infantry brigade combat force and we expect to move out swiftly on the program.  The quarter was very good for Combat Systems from an orders perspective with a 1.4:1 book-to-bill leading to an increase in total backlog and estimated potential contract value. Demand for our products particularly our combat vehicles, remains strong with Europe leading the way. International order opportunities for Abrams are particularly strong. This was an impressive operating performance once again by the Combat Systems group in a constrained revenue environment.  At Marine Systems, revenue of $2.65 billion was up $115 million over the year ago quarter. It was flat sequentially, but up year-to-date. In the quarter growth was led by Columbia, TAO and repair work volume. For the first half revenue was up $283 million or 5.6%. This is very impressive continued growth. Operating earnings were $211 million in the quarter essentially flat with the year ago quarter as a result of a 30-basis point reduction in margin.  The margin compression was the result of the impact on Electric Boat of additional scheduled delays in the Virginia program from the supply chain as it struggles with recovering from COVID. EB is working closely with the Navy and suppliers including embedding operating and engineering personnel on-site to restore the necessary Virginia program cadence. Nonetheless, Electric Boats performance remained strong and while still early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule. Total backlog of almost $42 billion remains robust and is by far the largest of our operating groups. And lastly, Technologies. The segment had revenue of $3 billion in the quarter down $158 million from the year ago quarter or 5%. Two-thirds of the decline was attributed to Mission Systems, largely related to their continuing struggle with a shortage of chips which continues to plague their ability to deliver certain products. On the other hand, operating earnings of $304 million were down only $4 million or 1.3% on a 40-basis point improvement in operating margin to 10.1%. EBITDA margin was an impressive 14.1% including state and local taxes which are a 50-basis point drag on that result. Operating performance at GDIT was particularly strong 140-basis points better than the year ago quarter. These are industry-leading margin figures. Technologies had a good order activity in the quarter with book-to-bill of 1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon.  Mission Systems had nice orders for many of their product offerings, especially those impacted by the chip shortage. The IT pipeline remains healthy in most of our federal IT lines of business as the government continues to modernize and upgrade its mission support systems. GDIT has the opportunity to submit $35 billion in opportunities this year including $17 billion in the third quarter, most of which represents new work.  That concludes my remarks with respect to a solid quarter and first half. I'll now turn the call over to Bill for further remarks and then I'll provide our updated guidance. 
Bill Moss: Thank you, Jason, and good morning. Starting with cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $650 million, which following our strong first quarter performance brings us to over $2.6 billion for the first six months of the year. This was achieved once again on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large international combat vehicle contract, which continues to receive payments as scheduled according to the contract restructure that occurred in 2020. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $435 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date, yielding a conversion rate of 151% year-to-date. The strong performance so far reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income. And of course, as a reminder that outlook assumes current law with respect to the tax treatment of research and development expenditures. If the Congress acts to defer or reverse the current capitalization requirement we would expect free cash flow for the year at or above 110% of net income. Looking at capital deployment capital expenditures were $224 million in the quarter or 2.4% of sales. That's up from last year consistent with our expectation to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. For the first six months we're closer to 2% of sales, but 2.5% remains our full year target. We also paid $349 million in dividends and spent approximately $800 million on the repurchase of 3.6 million shares. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 4.9 million shares for just shy of $1.1 billion. The net result at the end of the second quarter was a cash balance of $2.2 billion, and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down more than $2 billion from this time last year. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $95 million, down from $109 million in the second quarter of 2021. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $193 million down from $232 million for the same period in 2021. At this point, we continue to expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $380 million, including the assumed repayment of $1 billion of notes that mature in the fourth quarter. The tax rate in the quarter was 17% bringing the rate for the first half to 15.6%, so no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year. But of course that implies a rate in the mid-16% range for the second half of the year, to arrive at that outcome. To shape that for you, we expect the rate to be somewhat lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the second quarter with a 1.1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Jason mentioned, order activity in Aerospace led the way with a two times book-to-bill, which is the fifth consecutive quarter the book-to-bill for the group has been 1.6 times or higher. As a result Aerospace backlog is up over $5 billion in the past year, an increase of almost 40%. During the quarter, we finalized negotiations on the restructure of the last of our arrangements with a fractional aircraft operator, which resulted in a roughly $300 million reduction in the Aerospace backlog and a $900 million reduction in aircraft options. This action essentially clears our backlog of any exposure to fractional customers and has no impact on our production and revenue forecast for 2022 and beyond. On the Defense side, Combat Systems and Technologies also had solid quarters with a 1.4 times and a one times book-to-bill respectively. The increase in the Combat Systems backlog was particularly notable given a headwind from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of over $200 million in the quarter and $300 million year-to-date. Incidentally, the FX fluctuations also negatively impacted Combat's revenue by $65 million in the first half of the year as the euro fell to near parity with the dollar. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.6 billion while total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $126 billion. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Jason to give you an update on our guidance for 2022 and wrap-up remarks.
Jason Aiken: Thanks, Bill. Let me do my best to give you an updated forecast. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won't repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to this that will be posted on our website, which should be helpful. In Aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.9% which is 10 basis points higher than we previously forecast. This will result in additional operating earnings. There could be some upside here if we can deliver out a few more planes in the year. With respect to the Defense businesses, Combat Systems should be on the low end of our revenue range with an improvement of up to 50 basis points of operating margin. So total revenue of around $7.1 billion and operating margin around 15%. There's no change to Marine Systems revenue, but 30 basis points lower margin. So annual revenue of $10.8 billion with an operating margin around 8.3%, for the reasons I have previously described to you. Technologies revenue will be in the middle of the forecast revenue range at the same operating margin driven by GDIT with 3.5% year-over-year growth. So for the group, we expect annual revenue of around $12.9 billion with an operating margin around 10%. So, on a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue at the higher end of our initial guidance and an overall operating margin around 10.8%, which is unchanged. This rolls up to EPS at the high end of our previous guidance range. In short, we expect only modest deviation from our initial guidance. That concludes my remarks, and we'll be pleased to take your questions.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead when you ready, Robert.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Jason Aiken: Good morning, Rob.
Robert Stallard: Jason, I'll kick it off with one for you. The big question we've been getting from folks is what the impact could be on business jet and the Aerospace division from a slowdown in the global economy. I was wondering if you could give us some perspectives on how this could play out and how aerospace is differently positioned from where it was say in 2007 2008?
Jason Aiken: Yes. So, I think the most important point here, Rob, is the robust nature of the demand we've seen up to this point, the order activity that's resulted in the extended backlog that that provides us. Not to mention frankly -- and Bill spoke to this a little bit in terms of some of the cleanup in the quarter, but the durability of the backlog that continues to just increase the quality of that order book as we move forward. So, obviously, we can't predict when and what any type of slowdown will look like. There's a lot of talk out in the market about interest rates, inflation, the stock market recession potential and so on. But to be completely frank with you, we have not yet seen any impact of that in terms of our order pipeline and the resulting order activity that we've seen. There continues to be a very strong customer demand. We're continuing to see that as we embark here into the third quarter. And so I think bottom line between the size of the backlog, the ongoing order activity the durability of that backlog, which at this point is in excess of 2.5 times our annual sales for the group. Notwithstanding, the possibility of economic slowdown or similar conditions, we remain very confident and steadfast in our outlook for the next couple of years that we provided in terms of 2023, 2024 and beyond.
Robert Stallard: Okay. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned the AJAX program in the Combat Systems division. Could you give us an update of what the situation is there and how it's to pan out from here? Thank you.
Jason Aiken: Sure. So the program is proceeding. The vehicle tests are continuing and they continue to confirm frankly the vehicle performance that we've seen to date. With respect to some of the things that the customer has been focused on when it comes to vibration in the vehicle, some concerns that emerged in some of the early customer trials have been addressed at this point. And we are working right now on -- with the customer on securing appropriate communications gear. So I think the key here at this point is that this is going to really be all about how soon approvals can move through the system as we undergo this series of deliberate tests that take time as would be the case on any new platform development program. Frankly this is not inconsistent with experience that we would expect on any new platform development. But like I said we continue to work with the customer and they continue to assure us of their commitment to the program as well as of their need for this transformational capability. So it's an ongoing path forward, continuing to make progress and we expect to see ourselves to the other side of this testing and trials period soon enough and onward and upward with the program.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question on the line from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead when you're ready.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning.
Jason Aiken: Good morning Seth.
Seth Seifman: Good morning. Just to start off, I'm sure you've gotten this question a bunch of times but with regard to moving forward on G500 and 600 and the landing restriction, it sounds like you're still on track to have that lifted this quarter. And just any color you can give on what gives you the confidence there given that the Gulfstream, I think has done all its work but you're dependent on the FAA to do their work?
Jason Aiken: No you kind of summed it up nicely there Seth. The fact is we have the software fix for this issue completed. It's been developed. It has been tested. It has been flown. And so we have great confidence in the efficacy of that software fix. And we are currently working with the FAA Gulfstream and the FAA working concurrently toward the initiative to get this airworthiness directive resolved. The program plan for that is to complete by or before mid-September. To your point, we are in part dependent on the resources of the FAA to make that happen. But they have been very good about this. They are committing the resources that we think are necessary and the teams are working together. And right now, everything seems to be right on track for a resolution of this, by the end of the third quarter.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up still in Aerospace. This might be kind of a crude measure, but just looking at the revenue per aircraft in the quarter, it looks pretty strong. But obviously, we don't necessarily have all the information about mix and price and stuff like that. Can you tell us what the service growth was to help us hone in on that? And then, you mentioned a fractional settlement. Did that have any impact on the revenue in the quarter or any other backlog mechanics? Did those affect revenue?
Jason Aiken: Yes. So, on the service side, we did see very strong growth in the quarter. That's continuing a trend that we've seen, since we've been emerging from the pandemic, both including sort of flight hour ramp-up as activity and flight activity picks up around the world, as well as FBO activity at our Jet Aviation business, particularly on the US side. So I think we had somewhere in excess of 35% growth year-over-year in the quarter, in service activity. And it's frankly that service activity that is driving the upside to the revenue and the outlook for the Aerospace group for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we're still expecting our 123 aircraft deliveries for the year. So, a couple of hundred million dollars of additional revenue for the year is coming from that service side of the business. And I know you referenced, the cleanup we mentioned the backlog, but I sort of missed the latter part of your question. Do you mind repeating what you were getting at there? I'm sorry, Seth. He has already dropped off the line. Perhaps, you were getting at, whether any of the cleanup in the backlog has affected any of the revenue or other aspects of the Aerospace outlook. And the fact is, no, we're in good shape there. The cleanup as I mentioned or I think as Bill mentioned in the remarks was related to an ongoing negotiation we had with our really last sizable fractional customer in that backlog, and we've come to a settlement with that customer, removed some of the airplanes and expired some of the options there. And none of that activity has any impact on the outlook for the business. So all forecasts remain intact.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thank you.
Jason Aiken: Operator, hope we have our next question on.
Operator: We now have our next question from David Strauss of Barclays. Your line is open, David.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Jason Aiken: Good morning, David.
David Strauss: Jason, when we were down at Gulfstream back in June, I think you talked -- Gulfstream talked about being about 70% of the way through the software validation test on the 700. Can you just give us an update exactly where that stands today?
Jason Aiken: Yes. I don't have an exact number on the update of 70%. Obviously, the progress on that software validation has been slowed somewhat by the fact that we've had to divert common resources in terms of those flight sciences engineers over to the fix on the 500 and 600. So that, as I mentioned before is really what's sort of affirming our risk on the slip of the 700 entry into service. So there's been some modest progress there, but call it in that 70-plus percent range remains where we are at this point. As soon as we get through that airworthiness directive resolution, we'll get those resources back on that program and moving forward to that updated EIS date. 
David Strauss : Okay. And as a follow-up, can you update us on supply chain? Any constraints you're kind of seeing on the Gulfstream side of things? I think when we were down there it was discussed about some shortages on the engine side. How do you feel about the overall supply chain at Gulfstream and your ability to hit that 123 delivery number for the full year? 
Jason Aiken: Yes. So as you referenced supply chain is definitely -- not to sugar coat it, it's an ongoing issue for the industry. It's no surprise or no secret that I think the commercial aerospace industry has had a fragile supply chain even before COVID hit. So it's probably no surprise that that's only been exacerbated. And I'd say, it's a daily battle. But that said I think there's no team that I'd rather have tackled this issue than the Gulfstream team down there. They have people embedded throughout the supply chain actively managing these issues with our partners to help them meet our commitments to our customers. And so I think while there can be issues from supplier-to-supplier and it's an active management activity that's going on. It's important to consider the impact of any part or subsystem or so on to the overall tack time of the airplane production process and ultimately the delivery schedule. So just because, let's say, a particular part may be missing its due on dock date doesn't necessarily mean that that's going to impact overall completion of the airplane or delivery of the customer between workaround that our team has and other efforts to keep the overall aircraft flow moving we don't see any impact to the delivery outlook that we have for the year. Obviously, these types of activities aren't optimal. We want to get this corrected frankly for the benefit of the entire ecosystem. But we continue to have great confidence in the team at Gulfstream to get through the challenge and they'll meet their aircraft delivery forecast for the year. 
David Strauss : Thanks very much.
Jason Aiken: Sure.
Operator: Thank you for that. We now have the next question from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead when you’re ready, Ron.
Ron Epstein: Yes. Hey, thank you. Good morning everyone.
Jason Aiken: Good morning, Ron.
Ron Epstein: Question for you on again kind of maybe going back to the supply chain, but focusing a little bit more on Defense. So it seems like at Gulfstream, you guys are managing the constraints well. We've heard from some of the engine producers that castings and forgings and things are tight and you're managing through that. But it seems like you've got a lot more flexibility in your commercial business than you do in your defense business. And one of the themes that seems to have emerged from this quarter is that because of the way defense contracting is done we continue to hear shortages of A, B and C. Is there anything you guys can do about chip shortages buying inventory ahead, or are you just so constrained by the kind of the materials management acquisition rules that you can't do that? Because it seems like defense is just sort of fundamentally this sort of just-in-time business, but we're in sort of a just-in-case world if you get the gist of the question. 
Jason Aiken: Yes. No, it's a great question Ron and I'll kind of break that down into two aspects of our business sort of the short-term side and the long-term side. And the piece that we're seeing a bigger issue in on the short-term side and you referred to the chip shortage it's really that the Mission Systems piece that we've talked about for some time now. And again that's because these are quick turn orders. They're product-driven. They're dependent on these chips and you got to get them out the door. And obviously these are highly engineered high-end design engineering type products. So to your point the specifications are quite specific. That said, number one, I think the team is doing a tremendous job trying to develop work around. They are out there ordering parts in advance where they can. It's tough to get your spot in line because this is an issue affecting not just the industry, but the broader economy, but they're doing their best they can on that front. They are also working to change designs, modify designs, accept alternate parts where they can and be as nimble as they can on that front, but that obviously takes some time. I think importantly for that side of the business, this is just a timing issue we've seen here. If you take for example the second quarter and the product it wasn't able to ship at the end of the quarter, we've seen the vast majority of that actually get shipped in the first month of the third quarter. So that is flowing through. It doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. I think this is going to be something that's going to bug us for the balance of the year and maybe spill over a little into next year. But the fact is we've seen some of the strongest order activity from the customer in this area. So I think this is just a timing thing. We'll come through it and the order demand is there so that this will continue on into the balance of this year and beyond. So that's sort of on the short-term side of the business. The other big supply chain side that we're seeing frankly is a little bit different. It's on frankly the longest – longest leg side of the business and that's in the shipbuilding side. And really there it's less about parts or material availability. It's about the availability of labor the price and availability of skilled labor. And so we're seeing that really hit the supply chain for us. And for us it's focused primarily on the Virginia Class program. When you think of NASCO out on the West Coast and frankly the Columbia program at Electric Boat those are all hitting this in stride. But on the Virginia program, the supply chain has stumbled a little bit more. And when you think about it we have been working hard even prior to COVID to ramp-up our resources on those programs to support two per year Virginia as well as the addition of Columbia. And we were making pretty good headwind on that. And then COVID hits and you take two steps back instead -- or at least a pause instead of needing to take two steps forward. So when you think about shipbuilding and the nature of that business -- a shock like that to the system can hit it quickly, but it just takes time for it to recover. And so that's what we're seeing on the Virginia program as the supply chain is struggling to catch back up and, sort of, hit that cadence that they need to be on. But again like Gulfstream like Mission Systems Electric Boat has got all the resources that we can bring to bear and all the sense of urgency to apply to that supply chain. And once we can get that schedule right I think we'll be back on track. But in the meantime that schedule extension brings cost and that cost brings an impact to margins and that's what's affecting our outlook for that business. So that's -- I'm trying to give you a complete answer as I can on the supply chain as it hits the defense side. So that's sort of both into the spectrum from my perspective. 
Ron Epstein: Yes. Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on combat. With all the awards that have been coming in and the activity in Europe when would you expect that to flow through the business? Is that a 2023 kind of thing? When would we expect to see that kind of -- at least on the top line? 
Jason Aiken: Yes, good question. I want to take a step back and maybe give a little clarity on what we've seen through the first half of this year and then what that means for where we're going. Obviously in the first half of the year we're down notionally a little bit more than you would expect given our full year outlook. I think we're about 10% down year-to-date. If you do some quick checking you'll see that what that's really a function of it that last year, our revenue per quarter was essentially consistent throughout the year, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, which is really in contrast to the tried and true annual cycle that we see in Combat Systems and we're frankly once again seeing this year which is a sequential ladder, if you will, lowest in the first quarter, rising to the fourth quarter. So, that created a little unusual headwind in terms of the year-over-year comparisons. But we're still -- based on the way the second half plays out, still expecting to be at the low end of our revenue forecast. So, what does that imply? That implies about a 3.5% growth in the second half versus the second half of last year and I think that's imminently achievable by that group. But looking beyond that to your point, there's a tremendous amount of activity in this market. Obviously, as I mentioned before, the MPF award is a big one for us. That's a whole new additive space in the infantry brigade combat structure there. And there's tremendous demand signals internationally as you mentioned. Obviously, we're working toward the tank opportunity in Poland. There's other international tank opportunities as I mentioned before. And then you alluded to sort of demand generally internationally and everybody has kind of the suspicion that everything going on in Eastern Europe is going to lead to significant growth for the -- on the defense side. And certainly we are seeing those demand signals. I think the key thing that we all have to keep in mind here is to keep and check our expectations with respect to timing. The demand signals are there. We are having regular dialogue and ongoing conversation with those customers about that interest. But it just takes time for interest to turn into budgets to turn it into appropriations to turn into contracts to turn into revenue. So, I think it's all consistent with our long-term outlook that by 2024 and beyond we ought to see a nice uptick trajectory in Combat Systems. We're still talking low to mid-single-digit growth, but we ought to see an inflection point to growth out in that period and all of that is supportive of this. But in the meantime I'd just reiterate our emphasis that the focus and the story for Combat Systems is a margin one. And you've seen how well once again this group can perform on the margin side and be a really good cyclical no matter what's happening on the topline.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Melius Research. Your line is open Robert.
Robert Spingarn: Hey, good morning.
Jason Aiken: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Jason I just want to go back to labor and talk across all the businesses where you stand where -- obviously, you said shipbuilding is a tough one. So, maybe that's the most challenging area. But when you look across the business, what is the labor and talent acquisition situation?
Jason Aiken: Yes, you touched on it Rob. The shipbuilding side has been the toughest one. We've seen that in Maine. We've seen that all over sort of the New England shipyards as we've tried to ramp up. And frankly those are the two shipyards at EB and Bath that we have the most opportunity to ramp up. And so you got -- it's not like a lot of other industries where you're hearing things about remote work the ability to pull people from all over the country and all over the world. You've got to get shipbuilders in those states and in those regions to do that work and so that's what presents the challenge. The good news is we -- as I mentioned well before COVID, we had been ramping up and anticipating ramp-up. And so we've had a lot of resources put in place as well as great partnerships at the state and local levels to get the kind of trade schools and apprenticeships and so on to make that happen. So, I think the resources are in place. We've just got to keep our flow moving through those processes, keep our training capabilities up and running, and we can catch back up with this. It's just going to take time. And again that's just sort of the nature of shipbuilding and it's a challenge that those teams are up to. When you look on the other end of the spectrum, I think it's all about GDIT. And obviously, they are in a hypercompetitive market for hyper-skilled talent, and that only gets more competitive all the time. I think the leading positions they have in their markets, the strong culture they have and continue to build with that workforce and the opportunities that they provide their workforce within the company, continue to I think put them in a good position to compete and keep and grow that talent, it's -- I'm not going to sugarcoat it though, it's a war for talent every day. And we just -- it's our job to keep up with that and punch above our weight, and continue to retain and draw in the kind of talent they need to do that work and as that business grows. So those are kind of the two ends, of the spectrum. I think the other area, that we monitor it closely, is at Gulfstream. Obviously, with the growth they have you need people to do that. I think, not to underestimate the challenge that they have, but I think they've done a really good job of keeping up with it and I don't see that as being as high a nail, an item for Gulfstream in the moment. There's nothing that we can take our eye off the ball, and they've got to keep at it, but I think they're up to that challenge as well. 
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, going specifically to Electric Boat and the focus on getting Columbia ramped up and the labor situation, you just talked about there. Have we seen any work packages moved between Electric Boat and Newport News, in order to manage volumes and address labor shortages either for you or for them? 
Jason Aiken: So, Rob, I hate to give you this answer, but that's the kind of thing I don't think, I should probably get into too great a detail. We obviously, work very closely with them as our teaming partner on Virginia, as well as our subcontractor on Columbia. It's a three-part conversation between us, Newport and the Navy, to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support that customer and the growth that they need. And I think, that's the most important message is we're going to do everything we can, to support that customer and we're working together as a team to do that. And both sides, I think have a mutuality around that that's very important and very supportive. So... 
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.
Jason Aiken: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. We now have the next question on the phone line from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead when you’re ready.
Doug Harned: Hi. Good morning. Thank you.
Jason Aiken: Good morning, Doug
Doug Harned: Good morning. I wanted to see, if you could give us a little bit of a picture on the mix of Gulfstream orders. And in particular the G650, has extended longer than I think you all, first expected strong demand. Can you give us a sense of, what the mix is and then also, how you're looking at G650 production over time? 
Jason Aiken: Yes, you're absolutely, right. The G650 order activity continues to be robust, frankly, beyond even what we I think perhaps conservatively expected. I think we've said, a couple of times now in the past and it continues to be the case that the announcement of the G700 and the G800 have absolutely for our market and our customers clarified, where we are with this family of aircraft. And it clarifies, what the 650 is in terms of an opportunity for those customers. So that airplane, I think, continues to have legs to it. To make no mistake about it, the 800 is the replacement for the 650. And as the 800 comes into service, we will work the 650 out. There may be some modest overlap as we feather in from one to the other. But I think, what this outsized demand on the 650 does is it gives us a lot of optionality. It gives us opportunity, if this demand environment continues. With respect to our outlook for 2023 and 2024, we'll have to see how that plays out. It's also giving us the optionality, to deal with some of these issues, we've talked about with the certification process. As the 700 slips, we're not backtracking on our commitments to the delivery units, the revenue and the earnings forecast that we've given for 2022, 2023 and 2024. And frankly the 650 demand is helping with that, as well as the demand environment in general. And to that point, you kind of asked about the whole portfolio. And I think there's some question and speculation out there among the community about the airworthiness directive and what that might mean for the 500 and 600. And I'd tell you again, we delivered the vast majority of the airplanes that we intended to this quarter. We expect that to be resolved by the end of the third quarter. And when you look at the order activity in the second quarter, I think, the 500 and 600 represented about half the order activity that we had. So there's no signs of slowing down there. Our customers understand what this little bump in the road is and so, those platforms continue to be very well supported. So across the board -- and I didn't even mention the G280, that continues to have great order demand. I think the mid-cabin space has really picked up in the aftermath of COVID. So really across the board, in the portfolio, we see broad-based demand for our airplanes.
Doug Harned: Well -- and then just as a follow-up, switching over to Technologies, I mean, I know there's been -- you've had challenges with award protests and so, there have been some difficulties. But this is something where we've been looking for growth for a long time. And if you look out over the next few years, I mean, how are you thinking about Technologies in terms of a growth trajectory? Because we just haven't really seen it yet.
Jason Aiken: So, obviously, this is a conversation we've been in for some time now. And I think if you look back, we had low single-digit growth last year. We're expecting modestly better growth this year. And as I reiterated earlier our updated outlook for the year is spot on in the middle of our revenue forecast range we gave back in January. Obviously, we're off to a little bit of a slower start to the year, but I'd say a little bit of a slower start and that's largely attributable to Mission Systems. I won't reiterate those issues, but we do believe that that is a timing issue for us. GDIT is flat for the first half, but we absolutely have a clear line of sight to growth for them in the second half. And so, look, I mean, what gives us confidence in this outlook? I think, the way we look at it is not any one particular win or loss or one program or another. It's really about all of the key, what I think about as, leading indicator data or statistics that are around a business that is made up of thousands of contracts across the portfolio. You're talking about order activity, win and capture rates on new as well as recompete business, book-to-bill, backlog, potential contract value, so on and so forth. And all of those metrics for us continue to support an outlook for this business of low to mid-single-digit growth. And when you look at GDIT, for example, they had awards in the first half that were valued at about $7 billion. And that's significantly higher than the first half of last year and the vast majority of that represents new work. So, obviously, this can be frustrating, I think, for you all. And sometimes it is for us, given the particularly lumpy aspect of this business when it comes to the protest and delayed award adjudication process. So it can come in fits and starts. But we remain bullish on this and we think bottom line, we're talking about a low to mid-single-digit growth outlook. And frankly, as I think about it, you may have noticed a couple of weeks after the quarter, we had the announcement of the Air Force European support contracts some $900-plus million opportunity. If that had happened a couple of weeks earlier, it would be kind of a completely different conversation around the book-to-bill for the Technologies group in the quarter. So that's just a one-off example, but it speaks to the point that, while timing can be frustrating and lumpy and the pipeline can be a challenge to get through, it doesn't change our long-term outlook for this business.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead, when you are ready, Peter.
Peter Arment: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Jason.
Jason Aiken: Good morning.
Peter Arment: Maybe we can get just your updated thoughts on -- we've seen the markups from defense budget working their way through the Senate and House. How is that impacting some of your defense business? And obviously I mean there's been a focus on combat and technology so kind of returning to growth. And just kind of any color you can provide there that would be helpful.
Jason Aiken: Yeah. I think the two things that I'd point out. It's obviously still very early in that process. But bottom-line as you'd expect shipbuilding remains extremely well supported. You can see the numbers there. And so that I think just continues to be supportive of our -- an underpinning of our outlook for the ongoing $400 million to $500 million a year growth in the Marine Systems business, so all positive there. I think the greater area of maybe anxiety or speculation is around Combat Systems and the Army budgets. We'll see where that goes. This is obviously something that ebbs and flows and has a lot higher beta in terms of an Army budget on an annual basis than on the Navy strategic side. But the fact is we can't ignore the fact that there is a significant amount of support among the Congress for increasing defense budgets. So Abrams, Stryker those continue to be very critical assets in the Army infrastructure and we think there's continued support for those. And so while there's a lot of chatter around it those are going to decline and what's going to happen. Let's just see how it plays out. I think we'll have to stay tuned and see.
Peter Arment: Okay. And just as a quick follow-up. Your thoughts on just any impact if we have a continuing resolution, obviously this is not -- you guys have managed through a lot of continuing resolutions. So, just thoughts on any impact there?
Jason Aiken: Yeah. I don't see any real high anxiety in the moment. It's obviously something to your point that we've learned to work with and work around. It's certainly not desirable by any stretch of the imagination, but it's almost become part of our annual reality. I think until these things get into a six-seven-month-plus type of situation that's when it really starts to affect our shorter-cycle business on the technology side, perhaps in the ammunition side. But beyond that we really don't see a significant impact at this point. Again, it's unfortunate. We don't like it but we've learned to try to operate around it.
Operator: Thank you. We would now like to have the next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead, when you are ready.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning guys. Thank you for the time Jason and Howard.
Jason Aiken: Yeah, morning Sheila.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. I wanted to maybe ask a shorter-term question to follow-up on Doug's on Technologies. It was down 3% in the first half and up 10% growth in the second half implied with the guidance. GDIT seems to be doing well like fairly flat. Can you maybe bridge us on mission? And how you think about supply chain getting back growing in the second half timing of funding because a lot of the GDIT peers have complained about that, maybe if you could just bridge us shorter term.
Jason Aiken: Yeah. You've touched on the key issues, but I think the biggest piece of it is what I mentioned before is that we're already seeing here in the third quarter our ability to catch back up on some of that delayed product shipment from the second quarter. We really got that balled up there toward the end of the second quarter and that hampered the revenue for the first half. But we -- look, I don't want to sugarcoat the challenge is Mission Systems is not out of the woods. So they're going to fight and scrap their way, but they're seeing their way toward workarounds on that supply chain side. And I have a good deal of confidence that they can get there. On the GDIT side, it is a frustrating environment in terms of the slow pace of the outlays. Frankly, we've seen that a bit on both the Mission Systems and GDIT side. But I think the hill that they have to climb in the second half is not as high. And I think we've got reasonable line of sight in terms of the work that's in the books and they just got to go execute on that should get them there in the second half. They've just got a little bit of go to get in the second half. So I feel even greater confidence on the GDIT side.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask a cleanup on aerospace. When we think about the 123 delivery side, how much of that includes G700s? And then given the raise was on service how much of the services business is in the backlog? 
Jason Aiken: So I don't necessarily get into detailed order – backlog and ordering cancellations on an aircraft-by-aircraft basis. I apologize I'm going to have to punt on that one. But on the service side, we typically don't have much in the way of service activity in the backlog. We have a very modest amount in the aerospace unfunded backlog category that is related to longer-term maintenance arrangements that we have with some larger customers. But the service activity across the board at Jet Aviation and Gulfstream is really a book-and-bill basis on a quarterly and annual basis so sort of a one-to-one typically there.
Howard Rubel: Operator, we will just take one more question. 
Operator: Thank you. We have the last question from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. You may proceed with your question.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So orders at Gulfstream for aircraft you mentioned about half in the quarter was for the 500, 600. You mentioned that the 650 is doing well. How is the 800? Because that's been introduced relatively lately. You now have a new competitor in the market that looks like they match you in range with four versus three sections. So how is the 800 doing? 
Jason Aiken: Yes. The demand for that aircraft is quite solid Cai. It's doing well every quarter. Booking orders I think between the fact that the 650 is still taking orders and the fact that the EIS for the 800 is still a good ways out, we're not expecting a massive surge in orders. As we start to move closer to that transition, you might expect it to pick up and shift more from the 650 to the 800. But right now I'd tell you it's just good solid order activity that is very much supportive of our EIS timing and our expectations for that airplane.
Cai von Rumohr: Terrific. And could you – could give us a little bit more color in terms of the order potential for combat? You mentioned Europe is strong. You mentioned Abrams. How about the rest of your vehicles? How about the munitions business? 
Jason Aiken: So the rest of the vehicles you have to think about our European Land Systems business. They have an extremely large installed base of wheeled and tracked combat vehicles that on the one hand have a replacement cycle with them that offers some opportunity in the out years, as well as it provides incentive for those who are trying to bring up their level of defense spending to do so in a way that aligns with their allies. And if their allies are operating and fighting one particular platform or another, that's an incentive for those who are starting to spend up more to achieve commonality with those allies. So we think that puts us in good stead for these opportunities that are coming out of threats in Europe. Across the board, though to be a little more specific, a lot of this stuff is either in the backlog or on the horizon when you think about the Spanish 8x8 vehicle. You've got again the potential – or the – I shouldn't say the potential, the impending order for tanks out of Poland. We're talking with Romania, Switzerland all of those are sort of bread and butter countries are all looking at increased spending on a variety of platforms. So that plus just sort of this, again, generic increased level of indicated interest across Europe, particularly Eastern Europe, I think it provides tremendous potential opportunity. It's just too early to try and count any of that and anticipate exactly when or what that looks like. Timing in Europe often can be a challenge. So it would probably be a bit of a fool's errand for me to try and get too specific around that. But we do see a good robust environment as supportive of combat.
Cai von Rumohr: Thanks, again.
Jason Aiken: You’re welcome.
Howard Rubel: And Brica, operator, I think we are done with the question-and-answer period. And I thank everybody for joining the call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and the highlights presentation, which will contain our earnings outlook. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Brica, you can now indicate the call is over please.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's call. Thank you all again for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-27 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. My name is Alex, and I'll be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions]. I will now hand over to your host, Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations for General Dynamics. Over to you, Howard. 
Howard Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With that completed, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. 
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.4 billion, operating earnings of $908 million and net earnings of $730 million. Revenue is flat against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are down $30 million, but net earnings are up $22 million in line which distorts the truly strong performance of the operating units. The improvement in net earnings was aided by less interest expense and a lower provision for income taxes against the year ago quarter. Earnings per diluted share are up $0.13 or 5.2% year-over-year. 
 The operating margin for the entire company was 9.7%, 30 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was as anticipated in our earlier guidance to you, but also shaped by the aforementioned expense at the corporate other line. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.10 per share. We have roughly $400 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and almost $20 million more in operating earnings. We also beat our own expectations, particularly so in aerospace, about which I will have more to say shortly. 
 As we indicated in our press release, cash from operating activities is just shy of $2 billion and about 270% of net income. After capital expenditures, free cash flow was $1.8 billion, 250% of net income. This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in the fourth quarter of last year and not at all typical for us in a first quarter. Obviously, we are off to a good start here. 
 This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in the fourth quarter of last year and not at all typical for us in a first quarter. Obviously, we are off to a good start here. This is, in important respects, a very strong quarter, a good foundation for the year.  
 So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason add color around the spectacular cash performance, backlog, taxes, deployment of cash and the makeup of the corporate other line then we'll answer your questions.  
 First, Aerospace. Aerospace enjoyed another strong quarter. It had revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $243 million with a 12.8% operating margin. Revenue was $16 million ahead of last year's first quarter despite the delivery of 3 fewer aircraft. Revenue was almost $180 million higher than anticipated by the sell side. The difference is almost entirely growth at Gulfstream Services and Jet Aviation.  
 Operating earnings of $243 million or $23 million ahead of last year's first quarter, a 10.5% increase and well ahead of sell-side expectations. The 12.8% operating margin is 110 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. Here, the gross margin on delivered aircraft was slightly better, particularly the 500, but fully offset by increased R&D spending. The improvement comes from higher service revenue, coupled with significantly better margin on net revenue.  
 On the Gulfstream side of the service business, it was the result of an extremely attractive business mix. For Jet Aviation, it was strong performance at the FBOs in the United States. Aerospace also had another very strong quarter from an order perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. Gulfstream aircraft orders alone had a book-to-bill of 2.1:1. The order activity at Gulfstream was strong across the board, but driven by orders for the 650.  
 Strong sales activity and customer interest continues so far this quarter as well. The U.S. market remains robust with some slight improvement in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. China remains slow. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has stopped activity in Eastern Europe and slowed activity in Western Europe. All of this, however, is trumped by the strength of the U.S. market.  
 I should add that flight activity is increasing in Western Europe, including flights to the U.S. This is a good leading indicator of an improving market in Western Europe.  
 On the new product front, the G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a steady basis and quality is superb. As of the end of the quarter, Gulfstream has over 160 of these aircraft in service, will support in the U.S. and Abrams interest from U.S. allies is increasing. Land Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. Orders in Europe were higher, primarily from negotiations that have been ongoing. The pipeline in Europe, however, has increased as nations are contemplating higher defense spending to respond to the threat.  
 Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me begin with a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter in '19. 2021 first quarter was up 10.6%. In first quarter of 2022, with the revenue of $2.7 billion, is up 6.8% over '21. The growth was led by Columbia class construction and repair volume.  
 We also enjoyed nice increases in TAO and DDG-51 construction volume. I'm pleased that the growth is spread over all shipyards.  
 Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, up $11 million or 5.5% on operating margins of 8%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. The total backlog of almost $43 billion remains robust and is the largest of our operating groups. 
 Finally, Technologies. This segment has revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, down $36 million from the year ago quarter, about a 1% decrease. However, GDIT enjoyed a $55 million increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter and a stunning $286 million sequentially. This was GDIT's highest revenue quarter in over 2 years.  
 Operating earnings at $298 million are down $8 million, roughly 2.6% on a 9.4% operating margin. Once again, GDIT was up $12 million quarter-over-quarter and $16 million sequentially. Technologies EBITDA margin was a strong 13.1%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result.  
 Total backlog grew $293 million sequentially and total estimated contract value grew $2.6 billion on the same basis. The book-to-bill for Technologies was 1.1:1, led by Mission Systems at 1.2:1, a good indication that their growth will soon resume. GDIT had good order activity with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Over 75% of this quarter's awards represented new business.  
 The G700 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. We have 5 flight test aircraft that have completed over 2,800 flight hours. We also have conducted over 25,000 hours of laboratory simulated flying. All structural testing is complete and all structural requirements have been met. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature.  
 The new Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 designed specifically to match the G700 aerodynamic to optimize speed, range, emission and fuel burn will be certified in the next few months. The engine is performing well and exceeding key performance parameters. Our final step toward entry into service is to complete certification flying with the FAA. This is typically the most predictable part of our test program.  
 All of this has been achieved during a pandemic and a certification process made increasingly rigorous due to industry events unrelated to Gulfstream. In that connection, this flight test process has a first-time requirement that was not part of our original flight test plan or any prior development effort. It is a model-based developmental software validation, a line-by-line examination of the plane software. The level of effort is considerable, completing 100% of the software validation is the impediment to finishing performance testing by the FAA and G800 first flight. I can assure you that the validation work to date has proceeded well and presented no surprises. It is just resource and time intensive. This leads me to some comments on the timing of certification.  
 We continue to target certification of the G700 for the fourth quarter of this year, but the ultimate timing is dependent on the FAA. It seems prudent for us at this time to recognize the risk of a 3- to 6-month slip in the process and to plan for it accordingly. If such a slip were to occur, we have offset any impact to our 2022 financial plan with an increase of deliveries of current production aircraft. This would also not adversely impact 2023. It also remains our view that the G800 certification will follow the G700 by 6 to 9 months.  
 Gulfstream remains committed to a safe and comprehensive certification test program. Production of customer G700 is underway, and we are preparing for entry into service. We will deliver a mature, high-quality aircraft.  
 Looking forward to next quarter, we expect to deliver 26 aircraft with rapid increases in the third and fourth quarters as we have previously indicated. So far, supply chain issues have been in the news in this category. However, we expect an increasing number of issues in this regard later in the year and believe we are on a path to work through them successfully. In short, off to a very good start at Aerospace.  
 Next, Combat. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.68 billion, down 8% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $227 million are down 7%. The numbers are reasonably consistent with our outlook and sell-side expectations. Margins at 13.6% are a 20 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter, so strong operating performance.  
 Stryker and Abrams have considerable support in the U.S. and Abrams interest from U.S. allies is increasing. Land Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. Orders in Europe were higher, primarily from negotiations that have been ongoing. The pipeline in Europe, however, has increased as nations are contemplating higher defense spending to respond to the threat.  
 Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me begin with a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter '19. 2021 first quarter was up 10.6%. And first quarter of 2022, with the revenue of $2.7 billion, is up 6.8% over '21. The growth was led by Columbia-class construction and repair volume. We also enjoyed nice increases in TAO and DDG-51 construction volume. I'm pleased that the growth is spread over all shipyards.  
 Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, up $11 million or 5.5% on operating margins of 8%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. The total backlog of almost $43 billion remains robust and is the largest of our operating groups.  
 Finally, Technologies. This segment has revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, down $36 million from the year ago quarter, about a 1% decrease. However, GDIT enjoyed a $55 million increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter and the stunning $286 million sequentially. This was GDIT's highest revenue quarter in over 2 years. Operating earnings at $298 million are down $8 million, roughly 2.6% on a 9.4% operating margin. Once again, GDIT was up $12 million quarter-over-quarter and $16 million sequentially.  
 Technologies EBITDA margin was a strong 13.1%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Total backlog grew $293 million sequentially and total estimated contract value grew $2.6 billion on the same basis. The book-to-bill for technology is 1.1:1 led by Mission Systems at 1.2:1, a good indication that their growth will soon resume. GDIT had good order activity with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Over 75% of the quarter's awards represented new business.  
 So good order activity in the quarter and good order prospects on the horizon. GDIT alone submitted over $5 billion in the quarter, bringing the number of submitted proposals in the decision or protest queue to $29 billion. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. We will, however, provide you a comprehensive update at the end of next quarter as is our custom.  
 This concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks and then we'll take your questions. 
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is the unusually high corporate operating expense of $71 million in the quarter, which is up from $32 million in the year ago quarter. 
 Given our full year expectation of around $110 million in corporate expense this year, you might have expected a first quarter number similar to last year. However, this year was impacted by a change to some of the terms of our equity compensation plan, which resulted in the acceleration of the expense associated with those awards. This was a onetime noncash item, and you should expect a lower corporate expense in the remaining quarters to result in our full year outlook of $110 million.  
 If you consider the performance of our operating segments in the quarter, excluding this corporate expense anomaly, the segment margins improved from 10.3% a year ago to 10.4% this quarter.  
 Turning to our cash performance. We had the strongest first quarter we've seen in some time. Following several years of negative free cash flow in the first quarter, this quarter was a marked improvement due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international vehicle program at Combat Systems.  
 For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of nearly $2 billion for a conversion rate of 270% of net income. Including capital expenditures of $141 million, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion or a conversion rate of 250%. So the quarter was well ahead of our expectations, some of which was favorable timing in our operating working capital, but the performance certainly reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income.  
 Looking at capital deployment, I mentioned capital expenditures were $141 million in the quarter or 1.5% of sales, which is consistent with last year. We're still planning for CapEx to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. We also paid $330 million in dividends and increased the quarterly dividend nearly 6% to $1.26 per share. And we spent over $290 million on the repurchase of $1.3 million of our shares at an average price of almost $225 per share.  
 After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.9 billion and a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down $2.8 billion from this time last year and about $1.3 billion below the year-end position.  
 Net interest expense in the quarter was $98 million, down from $123 million in the first quarter of 2021. The decrease in 2022 is due to the $1.5 billion reduction in debt last year. We have another $1 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we'll have more to say about our plans related to those notes as we get closer to their maturity in November.  
 The tax rate in the quarter at 14% benefited from the timing of equity compensation activity and associated deductions, consistent with our expectations. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year. But, of course, that implies a higher rate for the balance of the year to arrive at that outcome.  
 Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the first quarter with a 1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.7x book-to-bill, which is also the book-to-bill for the group over the last 12 months. As a result, aerospace backlog has increased by almost 50% in the past year.  
 Technologies and Combat Systems also had solid quarters with a 1.1x and a 1x book-to-bill, respectively. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.2 billion, while total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $129 billion.  
 Finally, a quick note on our expectations for EPS progression for the balance of the year. We expect the second quarter to be roughly $0.10 above the first quarter with more significant steps up in the second half of the year.  
 Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. 
Howard Rubel: Thanks, Jason. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. 
Mariana Perez Mora: This is Mariana Perez Mora on for Ron today. 
Phebe Novakovic: Before you get into your question, some of you may have noted an interesting juxtaposition of the subjects in my remarks. And I'll just note this the capacity for technology to air is endless. So nonetheless, I hope you got the message. All right, go ahead. 
Mariana Perez Mora: That's fine. We got the message, right, but we got it. So on aero, you mentioned strong volumes and margins at services, could you please give us some more color on what were the main drivers? And please help us understand how sustainable are those volumes on margins? 
Phebe Novakovic: So we had higher R&D, but we had a very strong margin performance in services and a particularly good mix in service R&D at Gulfstream. We had also some improvement in gross margins. So that mix drove margins. 
Mariana Perez Mora: And how sustainable are the volumes of services? Did anything change in the services business? 
Phebe Novakovic: We think that, that particular mix is going to be hard to replicate. But for the moment, we're sticking to our margin guidance that we gave you. Just to remind everybody, it is our custom to update you at the end of the second quarter with a full and detailed analysis of our prospects for the rest of the year by group and then a wrap up for the whole company. But we'll stick with what we've got now. We're off to a good start, however. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. 
Myles Walton: Phebe, on your comment around the software validation approach and the certification, is that something that's been recently added after the original certification plan was agreed to? Or is it just that you're getting to the point where you're having to accomplish this new element of your... 
Phebe Novakovic: No. This was an added process that we had not contemplated when we originally laid out our certification plan. And it's a result of events that are independent of us. 
Myles Walton: I see. Okay. And then on the free cash flow, Jason, is it the case it looks like unbilled was pretty favorable, and we know about the U.K. combat vehicle, but did the -- sorry, about the Canadian combat vehicle. But did the U.K. combat vehicle also start to pay out? 
Jason Aiken: No. As you point out, we continue to receive steady payments on the international program that we reset a couple of years ago. So that continues apace. We're still working through issues with the customer on the U.K. side. So we hope to see that resolved later this year. . 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. 
David Strauss: Phebe, could you touch on a little bit more on marine margins, I think at 8%, that's the lowest we've seen in a while. I think you've talked in the past about that business eventually getting 9% plus kind of margins. So can you talk about what exactly happened in the first quarter and the progression from here to get to that above 9% level? 
Phebe Novakovic: So as we've noted before, margins will be compressed as we work down our learning curves on Colombia. And as you may recall, we are booking initial Columbia at a conservative margin. That, coupled with the well-publicized supply chain scheduling issues in Virginia, have driven some margin compression. But we expect those to stabilize over time as well. 
Jason Aiken: And just to add to that, David, and put another point on what Phebe mentioned there, the Columbia program, while we saw growth, as she mentioned in all 3 of the shipyards, the Columbia program did bring more than half of the volume increase in the quarter. So just from a mix perspective, those are early margin rates on that program are impacting the aggregate margin for the group, too. 
David Strauss: Okay. And Phebe, I mean the outlook for this business longer term, you still think it can -- as Colombia gets further into production, do you still think it can be a 9% to 10% margin business? 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. As we get further into production, the schedule stabilize on Virginia and both Bath and NASSCO will also contribute. So we are targeting that, and we believe that, that is fully achievable. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. 
Seth Seifman: Phebe, you mentioned the outlook for Gulfstream, both for this year and reinforced the guidance for next year. So I understand that that's where we're headed in terms of deliveries. But I guess can you walk through the mechanics a little bit more? If Gulfstream needs to see a significant step-up in deliveries at the second half at the same time that we'll be seeing incremental supply chain issues and then there might be a need to backfill some G700 deliveries in 2023 with those supply chain issues potentially still out there kind of some of the things that give you confidence in that delivery outlook given those sort of qualitative headwinds that you talked about? 
Phebe Novakovic: So with respect to the supply chain, we are working through all of those. And we don't see those as impacting our '23 or '24 estimates that we gave you. Our estimates on Gulfstream are predicated on the current demand environment, which has been strong, as I noted, continues into this quarter along with our backlog. So we're pretty comfortable that we've got both the supply chain, the manufacturing capability to meet all of those 2 out-year requirements. 
 And as I noted in my remarks, if -- should there be a slip, then we will increase in production aircraft this year. But look, with respect to that slip -- potential slip, we wanted to be as transparent as possible to give you some insight when we saw it and then tell you that how we were going to address that so that there's no economic impact from that in either year '23 or '24. 
Seth Seifman: And then as a follow-up, Jason, I guess, maybe you mentioned you talked about addressing the debt on the next call maybe, but we could ask for a little bit of a preview. Just in terms of how you're thinking about it generally, there's probably some debt due each year for the next several years. We just saw one of your peers look to kind of term things out for a while. How do you think about where you want to take the capital structure from here and the role of debt repayment now that interest rates are going up? 
Jason Aiken: Yes. I think our overarching approach to this remains unchanged. We continue to target the mid-A credit rating and want to get our metrics in line with that for the long term. In keeping with that, I think you can expect us to retire this debt that we see coming due later this year. What happens after that, I think, remains a little bit in play. We'll have to see because we talked about the elevated debt we had post CSRA acquisition and the fact that we intended to bring that down, but we never intended to get back to the level we had been with essentially 0 net debt prior to that acquisition. 
 So now we're getting into the range looking ahead into the next couple of years where we're probably going to be evaluating, is this the place to land. We don't have an answer to that yet, but that's going to become more of the conversation. So we'll see where that plays out. I expect at this point that we'll go ahead and retire the debt that matures at the end of this year, but then we'll be more active in that conversation. But again, I think, ultimately, targeting that mid-A credit rating and everything that is attended to that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. 
Robert Stallard: Phebe, you mentioned the very strong order performance in Aerospace this quarter. But I was wondering what sort of impact this has had on the lead time for Jet, specifically the G650 you mentioned? Whether this is starting to have any sort of impact on customer demand? Are people like saying it's going to take too long to get my jet? 
Phebe Novakovic: No, we've managed that lead times very successfully. So present and even given the robust demand, we do not see that as an issue. 
Robert Stallard: And just a follow-up, how is the pricing environment evolved over the last 3 months? . 
Phebe Novakovic: Well, as you know, we are reticent and loathe to talk about pricing, but you can imagine that the pricing has kept pace with other economic factors. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. 
Robert Spingarn: Phebe, I was hoping to dig in to Combat a little bit and just ask what types of products you expect European nations to demand most? And to what extent do you expect those to be products from Combat Systems and particularly from ELS? 
Phebe Novakovic: So should the recent threat environment drive increased spending in rearming and recapitalizing land forces, we will see an increase in demand. And I suspect it to be aligned along our ordinance business as well as our vehicle business, both in the United States and at ELS. But I'm careful not to get ahead of our customers here. 
Robert Spingarn: Do you see much opportunity in technologies, perhaps for mission or even GDIT maybe on the cyber side over there? 
Phebe Novakovic: There could be some because clearly in today's war fighting environment, interoperability on networks and communication is critical and reliable interoperability. So I suspect there could be some increased demand, but we have not seen any of that so far. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. 
Douglas Harned: Can you comment on inflation? When you look forward, obviously, we're in perhaps a difficult inflationary environment. In terms of how you see it affecting, both on the Gulfstream side and on the government customer side, in terms of what you can pass through? What could pressure margins? 
Phebe Novakovic: So let me address that holistically across the company because we've dealt with inflationary pressures and increases in commodity costs in varying ways through a portfolio of actions. One is our contract architecture. A second is to the extent possible price increases. We've cut costs in other areas to offset some of the increases and then where possible we've had commodity substitutions and part substitutions. So that combination of arrows in our quiver has mitigated any impact. And at the moment, we do not project a margin compression as a result of increased prices. 
Douglas Harned: So your -- so you see -- are these things that you would have not done before? Are you doing things that offset -- basically reduce your costs in other ways? Or is it more on the ability to pass through some of the price increases? 
Phebe Novakovic: I can't give you a very -- I can't unpack that and give you a very clear distinction between which of these capabilities or which of these tools has resulted in the largest impact on our ability to offset inflationary increases, but -- because it's a combination of things. In some contracts, you've got contract architecture that protects you. In other cases, you take additional cost cuts that you had not anticipated taking before. But one of the things you expect from a company with strong operating leverage is when a cost increases somewhere else, you have to find offsetting cost reductions. And so we have historically done that, and we're continuing to do that. And then in some instances, you can have product substitutions. That's not particularly frequently, but it can happen in some critical products. So I think it's that panoply of weapons that we've used to offset these increases. 
Operator: Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. 
Sheila  Kahyaoglu: So I wanted to ask about R&D profile of the business for Gulfstream in 2022, '23 and '24, since you've given guidance for Gulfstream profitability. When we think about the G700, the G800 and the 400, what's the magnitude of the investment you have to put in to work with the FAA? Or is it more of a heavy time burden? Like how do we think about that, Phebe, in terms of dollar amount? Or is it just more time and a push out of notification and deliveries? . 
Phebe Novakovic: Well, as we've noted, it's more a question of time resources, certainly on the new requirements. But you saw an increase in R&D this quarter. And it was because that we have this new set of software validation requirements that we need to walk through, and we've accommodated that in our plan. Jason, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? 
Jason Aiken: Yes, just making sure we understand the nature of your question. I mean if it's about this potential risk that Phebe talked about and the additional effort we have to undertake in the certification process, it is both a time risk, but, of course, cost travels with time. And so there's the burden of the additional effort that goes on, the man hours that have to occur to accomplish those tasks. 
 So it puts some pressure on the R&D budget. And as Phebe said, you saw some of that even in the first quarter. But I don't think any of this is enough to change the profile of what we've talked about either from an R&D spend in the aggregate in the '22, '23, '24 time frame or as we think about it in terms of the margin rate impact that it has on the business. 
 So again, just to recap where we see this, we're in an elevated state this year. It will remain elevated in '23. And then once we get the 700 and the 800 certified, it remains somewhat elevated, but will notch down a step down in '24 as the effort shifts more towards the 400, and then we'll see it sort of return back to more of a normal run rate level beyond 2024. 
Sheila  Kahyaoglu: And then maybe one more on technology. How are you thinking about the Technologies portfolio? I think it has a lot of good businesses in there, but organic growth hasn't been as robust as say Marine. So how do you think about the good businesses in that portfolio overall? Do you like it as a whole as a combined technology of an ammunition business? Or any thoughts to that? 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. We spent a fair amount of time early on after the acquisition of CSRA, trimming that portfolio both in our IT business as well as in our Mission Systems business. So we like the mix of lines of business that we have right now. We believe they're complementary, and we believe that they're good growth engines, but I don't know that we heard your questions that clearly, but if one of them was -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but if one of them was comparing this to Marine growth, very few items in the defense budget are going to grow as reliably and as robustly as the submarine and shipbuilding accounts. So I wouldn't hold that as the metric, I think continued steady growth on the top line. But more importantly, the bottom line in Technologies has really been our focus. Does that make sense? 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Maugeri from Wolfe Research. 
Michael Maugeri: I think historically, sort of your commentary has been for $400 million to $500 million of annual revenue growth at Marine sort of implies some moderation from here. Growth has been strong over the last few years, maybe some risk retirements coming through on Columbia class. So with that said, I mean, is there any sort of good reason to think that growth should moderate over the next few years at Marine? 
Phebe Novakovic: No. We continue to project $400 million to $500 million a year on average. You'll see some perturbations in quarterly growth, largely driven by material sales, but nothing that changes the trajectory. 
Michael Maugeri: And then sticking with Marine, can you speak to the pipeline at Bath, maybe some upside there as it might relate to hypersonic work on DDG-1000, additional work for DDG-51? Or are we sort of pretty much tapped out there from a capacity standpoint? 
Phebe Novakovic: Well, yes, those are mixing kind of 2 different predicates. One, there's been a lot of talk about integrating various weapon systems on to shipboard platforms, but we haven't yet seen any of that materialize. And so it is not a question about capacity. We have adequate capacity that we expanded and updated and upgraded in the last few years through our capital deployment improvements at Bath and frankly, the other shipyards. So it's simply a question of the demand coming out of the U.S. Navy, and we haven't had any surprises there. They're continuing with respect to Bath and maybe have continued to support DDG-51 production. So we expect that to be a steady pace going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Baird. 
Peter Arment: Phebe, maybe just circle back on your comment regarding the pipeline increasing potentially with Combat. I'm just curious about your overall comments on how we should expect it's eventually show up in backlog. Should we consider this more of a '23 and '24 event when we're thinking about that? And then just as a follow-up related to kind of the budget outlook, just now that we've gotten the '23 requests and we saw what was enacted for '22. Maybe you could just give some high level thoughts on GD is faring given the request? 
Phebe Novakovic: If you're talking specifically about Combat, I think that it's hard to give projections about timing when, in fact, the budgets for the most part, have not materialized in significant increases. But were they to in the land forces and land forces modernization, we have every expectation that the vehicle -- combat vehicles demand will increase and ordinance and armaments will increase. So I think it's premature to bake in any assumptions about growth until you really see some of that. 
 And I would say that one of the interesting things that we have not quite seen at the same level is the Abrams interest from multiple U.S. allies. So we'll have to see how that plays out over time. There are some potential out there. But as I said, I don't want to get too far ahead of our customers here, got to see how all this -- takes time to get from the threat to full funding to allocation of awards. I think you'll hear that from a lot of folks, not just us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. 
Cai Von Rumohr: So Phebe, at Bath you recently had a mid-contract wage hike where the lower 5 of the 10 pay grades had a pay hike of over 20%. Now I assume mix is an issue, but could you comment on what that impact is on labor availability and cost and is there any read across to electric boat that this should be a concern there, too? 
Phebe Novakovic: So the wage increase at Bath is an attempt to help stabilize the manufacturing workforce and build ships faster. So this, in turn, will ultimately help competitiveness and margins. So we think we can fully address any cost impact. And I think the touch labor market has been less impacted by some of the well-publicized labor shortages and they tend to be more regional to the extent that they've existed. So we do -- we take each one of our lines of business on a case-by-case basis and then react accordingly. But Bath was a special set of circumstances given Maine and the realities in Maine regarding workforce. 
Cai Von Rumohr: And then switching gears a little bit, what impact do the Russian sanctions have on your business at Gulfstream? . 
Phebe Novakovic: So to the extent that we expected an impact we anticipated it to show up at Jet Aviation in some of their European locations. But they were -- Jet was able to offset that with additional volume. With respect to Russia, as I noted, I think, before, they are less than 5% of our Gulfstream backlog and we had no deliveries this quarter, obviously. We've had no cancellations. And we have, in this demand environment, been able to manage the relatively few number of Russian airplanes in our backlog. So we do not see an impact at the moment. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. 
Matthew Akers: I wonder if you could talk on Technologies, a couple of things. I guess, one, I think you commented on some supply chain impacts on Mission Systems, just how those are trending. And then also just the timing of some of these new awards and when they get start to ramp up. 
Phebe Novakovic: So we discussed, I think, with you, I think starting maybe in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, the -- some of the chip shortages that we were experiencing at Mission Systems that was constraining the ability to deliver a series of different kinds of products. So we have largely worked through those issues at Mission Systems, but we are now contending with the pent-up demand that resulted -- was generated by last year's slower deliveries as a result of chip shortages. 
 And as we work through that, that ought to be upside for Mission Systems on the revenue side as we go forward. And then the timing of new orders typically at GDIT, they tend to be a -- tend to have a quarter lag or quarter and half lag from time of award to new starts. So we'll see some of the more recent larger awards begin to show up next quarter and then increasing over time. 
Matthew Akers: And if I could on Gulfstream, I mean one of the questions I've gotten is how sort of sustainable this business could be if we do go into a recession? I guess can you just talk about if that come up at all with your customers, are people concerned about the economic outlook, and sort of how resilient do you think this business could be if we do have a downturn? 
Phebe Novakovic: Well, we haven't heard a whole lot of that in the pipeline, but let's pass this prologue here. And I think what we have demonstrated repeatedly at Gulfstream is that Gulfstream is a very good cyclical. And in the past, what we've seen is relatively short economic perturbations and a pretty quick recovery at Gulfstream. 
 So I think our job is to manage and play the cards that are dealt to us, and we've done so very effectively. So you can probably estimate the future of the U.S. economy better than we can. That seems to be a great support and get a Nobel prize if you get it right. But we're quite comfortable at the moment on where we stand, and I'm very comfortable with Gulfstream's ability to continue to be a good cyclical. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. 
Kristine Liwag: Phebe, looking at the fiscal year '23 budget request, we're seeing a generational investment in the nuclear triad benefiting the Columbia-class. And we're also seeing advanced capabilities like safety systems seeing outsized growth. So as you look at your portfolio, with the IT business stable, leverage has come significantly down, what's your appetite to add a new vertical to the business to capture more of this outsized growth in advanced capabilities that you may not have today? 
Phebe Novakovic: No, I think we do not discuss potential acquisitions or divestitures, but we like where we are positioned to take advantage of the recapitalization of the triad. You want to ask another question? 
Kristine Liwag: Yes. And maybe following on capital deployment then. Understanding that you're not going to talk about large M&A, what about additional priorities for cash? How should we think about dividend payments versus share repurchases, particularly as you're in the leverage where you want to be and the business is generating significant amount of free cash flow? 
Jason Aiken: I think fundamentally, there's no change to the way we've articulated our capital deployment priorities. We talked a little earlier about the dividend increase earlier this year. That was the 25th annual -- consecutive annual increase. We've made pretty clear the significant investments we've been making in the business over the past several years. And now really, if you will, if there's any pivot at all, it's shifting back the attention more toward rewarding those patient shareholders with return of capital and share repurchases. 
 And you've seen us do that last year. We embarked on that a little bit in the first quarter, and I think you should expect to see us continue that in a tactical and opportunistic way. M&A is always opportunistic. And as Phebe said, not something that we disclose out in front of anything. So that's kind of how you should expect us to behave. 
Howard Rubel: And operator, we'll take one more question, please. 
Operator: Our final question for today comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. 
George Shapiro: Phebe, you had $104 million cancellation in the quarter. And I guess from what you said in response to the question before, it wasn't due to Russia. So if you could tell us where that might have been? 
Phebe Novakovic: We had one cancellation. And I have no clue where it was, but it wasn't Russia. And that... 
George Shapiro: Yes. That's fine. And then Jason, where the payments from the Canadian contract in the first quarter similar to last year's first quarter, which was around $1 billion? And also, do you expect more to occur this year as well? . 
Jason Aiken: Yes. Payment levels this year are very similar to last year, both in the first quarter and for the balance of the year. So the pattern should be pretty similar. And again, that customer has been very consistent in their payments since we negotiated the recast of that program. 
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A for today. I will hand back to Howard Rubel for any closing remarks. 
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Alex. And thank everybody else for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for our first quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3117. Thank you very much for your attention today. 
Operator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full year 2021 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast which are available on the Investor Relations page on our Web site, investorrelations.gd.com. Now, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning, and thank you, Howard. Earlier today we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.3 billion, net earnings of $952 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.39. The sales in most respect consistent with our previous guidance sell-side consensus. The results in comparison with prior periods are rather straightforward and set out in our press release. I'll go through some of that detail quite briefly, as I give you my thoughts on the business segments. As we indicated, it would be, the final quarter is our strongest quarter of the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings, operating margin, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the prior quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvements. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that revenue was up $724 million, operating earnings were up $106 million, and earnings per share up $0.32. So, all in all, a solid quarter with good operating performance. For the full year, we had revenue of $38.5 billion, up 1.4% from 2020; net earnings of $3.26 billion, up 2.8% and earnings per fully diluted share of $11.55, modestly better than consensus and up $0.55 over 2020. We ended the year with a total backlog of $87.6 billion and total estimated contract value of $127.5 billion. Our business was strengthened by significant growth in aerospace backlog to $16.3 billion. I'll have more to say about that when we get to the business segment comments. The total company book-to-bill is one-to-one for the quarter and the year, led by the powerful order performance of Gulfstream. Our cash performance for the quarter and the year is very strong. The conversion rates of the quarter is 136% of net income and 104% for the year. Jason will have more fulsome comments on this subject and backlog in his remarks. Now let me turn to reviewing the quarter and paying some attention to quarter-over-quarter and sequential comparisons as well as full year in the context of each group and provide colors appropriately. So, first Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.6 billion is up 5.1% over the year ago quarter on the delivery of 39 aircraft, 35 of which were large cabin. While this was the strongest delivery quarter of the year, it fell short of our expectation by one aircraft, which has flipped  into 2022. For the full year revenue of $8.1 4 billion is up modestly from the prior year even though we delivered 119 aircraft, 8 fewer aircraft than we did in 2020. The increase was driven by higher service revenue at Gulfstream and a nice increase in revenue at Jet Aviation. Fourth quarter Aerospace earnings of $354 million are down $47 million from year ago quarter, even though revenue was $125 million higher, resulting in a 270 basis point reduction in operating margin. The major source of the variance is a $50 million increase in net R&D costs driven by the certification on the G700 and G800 and accelerated work on the G400. The year ago quarter was also helped by a significant launch assistant payment that was an offset to gross R&D. Nevertheless, Aerospace operating earnings and margins are better-than-anticipated by consensus. The same can be said for the full year results. I should also point out that Aerospace margins improved throughout the year and that was true with respect to both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. At midyear last year, we told you we expect revenue of about $8.2 billion; operating margin around 12.4% with earnings of $1.01 billion. We finished the year with revenue of $8.14 billion; operating earnings of $1.03 billion and a 12.7% operating margin. In sum, we were slightly better on earnings and margin, but very close to our forecast on revenue.  the most important story in the quarter for Aerospace and frankly for the company was the extraordinary order activity of Gulfstream. Last quarter, I told you that orders in the third quarter boarded on the spectacular. This quarter, they were significantly better. Order activity in the quarter was beyond anything we had seen since 2008 with the introduction of the G650. Demand that turned very good in mid-February and continued through the second and third quarters was red hot in fourth quarter. Let me give you the particulars. The Aerospace group in dollar denominated orders had a book-to-bill of 1.7 to 1. Gulfstream alone was 1.8 to 1 and in unit terms, it was over 2x. Remember that these multiples are off of an increased denominator with 39 deliveries. This translates into a very significant backlog growth. Aerospace added $1.6 billion to backlog in the quarter and $4.7 billion for the year. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains robust and sales activity is brisk. The buildup in backlog and the pace of current demand leaves us with a rich problem, but a problem nonetheless. How do we satisfy the demand manifest in our current backlog supplemented by continuing brisk activity having previously turned down production? Can the supply chain support us? Are we ready? Well, the answer is we will increase production in 2022, but not to where it needs to be. Remember also that some of our increased production in '22 will be in building G700s, and G800s that will not deliver in '22, a prebuild, if you will. As it turns out, the long pull in the 10 is manufacturing wings, which we do ourselves. You may recall that we previously vertically integrated wing supply because of  in the supply chain. So, what do we need to do? We need to expand our new modern wing facility and acquire another set of tools and fixtures. All of this is underway and will be in place to satisfy our needs for '23 and beyond. This leads to the question of what are the implications of this for 2022 guidance. I'll address '22 guidance a little later. Further, given the robust and enduring backlog of Gulfstream, we also feel comfortable with giving you a look at what is anticipated for '23 and '24 as well. Finally, on the new product development front, all 5 G700 flight test aircraft are flying and have over 2,200 flight test hours. We have completed over 65% of all required testing. Next Combat Systems. Revenue in the quarter of $1.89 billion is up 3.7% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $281 million are off $28 million on a 90 basis point decrease in operating margin. Let me point out, however, that a 14.9% margin in the quarter is highly respectable. For the full year, revenue of $7.35 billion is up $128 million, a 1.8% increase after strong growth in 2019 and moderate growth in 2020. Operating earnings for the year of $1.07 billion are up $26 million, a 2.5% increase. By the way, this performance is in line with the guidance we provided earlier in the year. As we look forward for the next few years, we believe that Combat volume will soften somewhat in the increasingly constrained budget environment faced by the U.S Army. While our platform programs remain critical to the Army War fight, we may see some contraction in part offset by international growth in Abrams, and real combat vehicles. We will continue to drive margins as we always have. Remember that Combat Systems has had very good margins and much more constrained revenue environments. In short, this group has had a positive revenue growth for several years now, continued its history of strong margin performance, has good order activity and has a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Next, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was up less than 1% over the year ago quarter. However, revenue is up 8.8% sequentially and 5.5% for the full year. Similarly, operating earnings are down somewhat in the quarter, but up sequentially and for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group. In our initial guidance to you, we anticipated revenue of about $10.3 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $855 million. We came in above that for both revenue and earnings and spot on the predicted operating margin. Our shipyards have continued to perform well overcoming most of the challenges that COVID lay in our path. First, continuing to operate without ceasing throughout COVID, and more recently managing labor shortages, part shortages, supply chain disruptions, and increasing commodity prices. Importantly, on the latter point, our long-term shipbuilding contracts provide protection from material escalation. I'm happy to report that we are working very well with the Bath unions and workforce and together we have worked put the past behind us and concentrate on improving schedule and performance. As a result, Bath has begun to see improvement on both scores. In response to significant increased demand from our needy customer that you'll see in these results, we continue to invest in each of our yards, particularly at EB to prepare for Virginia Block V, and the Columbia ballistic missile submarine. Suffice it to say that we are poised to support our Navy customer, as they increase the size of the fleet and deliver value to our shareholders as we work through this very large backlog. Finally, the Technologies group which consists of GDIT and Mission Systems. Just to remind you, this is the group in the defense segment that had have the most impact from COVID-19 with the most remote participation from employees and the most difficulty accessing customer locations whose employees also have been working remotely. It is also where we have the most impact from this short supply of chips and other key components that mission systems. With that said, let's turn to the results and commentary on the Group and the specific businesses. For the quarter, Technologies had revenue of $2.98 billion, up 7.9% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings, however, of $334 million are up only 5.1% on a 30 basis point improvement margin. The operating margin of 11.2% is the strongest since the formation of this group. Revenue for the full year of $12.46 billion is up 1.5%, but earnings are up $64 million, or 5.3% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. All considered the group performance showed good strength and earnings are in line with guidance from us. Revenue came in at $543 million below our guidance driven by mission system challenges that we have discussed last quarter, offset in part by 2.2% growth the GDIT. Margins at both companies were very good enabling us to meet our earnings forecast. So very good operating leverage in a very challenging environment. The group enjoyed a nice order quarter with significant wins and a book-to-bill of 1 to 1, a little bit stronger GDIT and a little bit lower at Mission Systems. Mission Systems did a very good job overcoming many of their supply chain challenges, was working hard to satisfy the pent-up demand that was driven by a significant backup of work orders in some customers sites and by supply chain shortages. Turning to IT. Our Fed and Civilian division had a particularly strong year in '21 and help drive a 60 basis point improvement in margin over 2020. And as been the case since the acquisition, GDIT's cash performance was outstanding. Well in excess of 100% of their imputed net income GDIT's backlog at the end of 2021 was $8.7 billion, 4% higher than yearend '2020. Book-to-bill was 1.1 to 1 on sales growth at 2.2%. This is notable in light of the dollar value of GDIT wins and snared and protests that went from about $800 million at the end of 2020 to a whopping $6 billion at the end of '21. While we expect these protests will resolve in our favor, protest resolution timing is outside our control. As we look into '22, we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities to pursue as customers focus on digital modernization, and over $32 billion of bids, largely all new work awaiting customer decisions. So, all in all, we expect a good year for the business. Let me turn the call over now to Jason Aiken, our CFO, for additional commentary and then return with our guidance for next year. Jason?
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter or 136% of net income with strong cash performance across all four segments. That resulted in free cash flow for the year of $3.4 billion, a cash conversion rate of 104%. That was nicely ahead of our anticipated 95% to 100% of net income, and again reflective of solid performance across the company, but in particular, the strong order activity at Gulfstream. That strong performance enabled us to continue our balanced and robust capital deployment activities. To that point, capital expenditures were $385 million in the quarter or 3.7% of sales. That's up more than 10% from the prior year, and brings us to $887 million for the full year. Of course, Marine Systems continues to drive the elevated CapEx with facilities investments in support of the unprecedented growth the Group is experiencing now and for the next decade plus. The full year total for capital investments at 2.3% of sales is slightly below our original expectation of 2.5%. That's due strictly to the timing of the phasing of those projects. While our investments to support the Navy's submarine programs have peaked, we expect capital expenditures to remain somewhat elevated at about 2.5% of sales in 2022, slightly higher than 2021, before returning as we forecast for some time to our more typical 2% range in 2023 and beyond. We also paid $332 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.3 billion, and we repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to just over 10 million shares for the year for $1.8 billion at just under $179 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $135 million in 2021 and we expect that to decrease to approximately $40 million in 2022 as a result of the ARPA funding release. As we've discussed for some time, we expect to continue to generate cash in the 100% plus conversion range in 2022 and beyond. Our outlook assumes the unfavorable impact of the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenditures for tax purposes beginning in 2022, as called for under current law. There's proposed legislation to delay the effective date of this requirement, but we'll have to wait and see if it's approved by Congress and signed into law. Assuming there is a deferral of the R&D capitalization provision, we would expect our free cash flow to be in the 110% conversion range. We ended the year with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and no commercial paper outstanding, leaving us with a net debt position of $9.9 billion, down approximately $300 million from last year and the first time we've ended the year with net debt below $10 billion since 2018. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $93 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $424 million. That compares to $120 million and 477 million in the respective 2020 periods. The year-over-year reduction in interest expense is due to the retirement of $1.5 billion of long-term debt back in May. Our next scheduled debt maturity is a $1 billion in the fourth quarter of this year. And based on the declining net debt balance, we expect interest expense to drop to approximately $380 million in 2022. Turning to income taxes, we had a 15.9% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for the full year consistent with our previous guidance. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect the full year effective tax rate to remain around 16%. The rate for 2022 is not impacted by the R&D matter I discussed earlier because that legislation impacts cash taxes, not the effective tax rate. The 2022 rate also assuming there's no other enacted legislation impacting corporate tax rates. From a quarterly phasing perspective, we expect the first quarter rate to be lower due to the timing of certain tax items, so the rate for the remainder of the year will naturally be higher given the full year forecast. Quarter activity and backlog were once again a strong story with a 1 to 1 ratio for the company in the fourth quarter and for the full year. As Phebe mentioned, order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.7x book-to-bill on the quarter and 1.6x for the full year. As a result, the Group's backlog was up 40% in the past year. Technologies recorded a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 and within that group GDIT was 1.1x. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.6 billion and total estimated contract value which includes options and IDIQ contracts of over $127 billion. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you guidance for 2022 and wrap up remarks.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. And with that, I will turn to your expectations for 2022. So let me provide our operating forecasts for '22 initially by business group and then a company-wide roll up. In Aerospace, we expect 2022 revenue to be around $8.4 billion, up around 4% over 2021 with about 123 deliveries, up from 119 last year. Operating margin will be around 4.8%. So, a little color here about what is driving this forecast. Well anticipated deliveries are up only 4 units from '21, production of completed aircraft is considerably more than in 2021. Last year, we produced fewer than 119 aircraft that were delivered. We delivered a number of test aircraft that were either produced and completed in prior periods as well as a few demonstrators all up about 11 aircraft. In 2022, production we are building some G700s and G800 test articles that will not deliver this year. Finally, our ability to ramp up further in '22 is limited by the wing supply issue I described earlier, which will be remedied for '23. This leads me to a quick look at '23 and '24. In 2023, we expect to deliver 148 airplanes, 25 more than in 2022 and have revenue of approximately $2 billion more than '22, with margin improvement around 200 basis points. In '24, we expect to deliver around 170 airplanes, up another 22 driving another $1.6 billion of revenue over '23 and another 100 basis points of margin growth. So, all up over that 2-year near-term timeframe, we expect to see $3.6 billion of revenue growth over '22 and 300 basis points of higher operating margins. Mind you, none of this is supported by heroic assumptions about continuing demand. We assume a book-to-bill of around 1 to 1 during the period, a notable reduction from this year's demand. If demand is greater, it will impact favorably '24 and '25. In short, we fully expect Aerospace to be a significant growth engine for both revenue and earnings in 2023 and 2024. In Combat Systems, we expect revenue in the range of $7.15 billion to $7.25 billion, a modest reduction against '21. We expect operating margin to be about the same at 14.5%. Growth should resume later in our planned period as developmental programs move into production and several anticipated international orders should be received. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $10.8 billion, a $300 million increase over '21. Operating margin in '22 is anticipated to improve to around 8.6%. The long-term driver of growth here is submarine work, which will expand as the supply chain improves its efficiency and delivers modules to the Groton waterfront in a more timely fashion. Our biggest upside opportunity in this group is to increase margins in the period. We expect revenue in Technologies in the range of $12.8 billion to $13 billion. This is a growth of around 2.5% to 4.5%. We expect operating margins around 10%. So, for 2022, company-wide, we expect to see approximate $39.2 billion to $39.45 billion of revenue, and an operating margin of 10.8%. This all goes up to a forecast range of $12 to $12.15 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it has in prior years, with Q1 about $2.45 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter. Let me emphasize that this forecast is purely from operations that assumes a 16% tax provision, and it seems we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with yearend figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital.
Howard Rubel: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.
Operator:  We take our first question from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Yes, good morning, Phebe and .
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Ron.
Ron Epstein: I know you're going to get bombarded with Gulfstream questions. So, I'm not going to go there. I'll let everybody else do that. I just wanted to jump in -- yes, how about that. Maybe on Land Systems at first, right. I mean, the Ukraine and everything going on with Russia has been in the headlines, what does that mean for your international Land Systems business, particularly in Eastern Europe?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, for some time now, the Eastern European demand for combat vehicles has been at elevated level. But I have to tell you that speculation about the considerable tension in Eastern Europe and any subsequent impact on budgets is just still advised given the high threat environment. So, we are hopeful for a peaceful resolution. But that is a national security issue for the U.S and its allies.
Ron Epstein: Got it. And then maybe my follow-on question, if I can. And I shift back a little bit towards Gulfstream.
Phebe Novakovic: Sure.
Ron Epstein: You mentioned in your prepared remarks, you've got a little bit of a bottleneck in wing production. Have you thought about re-outsourcing wing? Or do you look at the wing as to something you guys want to keep? Because it's a key part of the plan.
Phebe Novakovic: Outsourcing, you sort of add a question given the problems in the supply chain on wings, which then drove us to internally source. And frankly, our wing production efficiency is not equal by any. This is just simply a question of expanding a wing facility just to touch and we need another set of tools. But we are very good at wing production. So, I think that that's a capability set that reduces a lot of risk and frankly, provides opportunity for the program.
Operator: The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much, and congratulations on the good results. So, Phebe …
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Cai von.
Cai von Rumohr: … net R&D was up $50 million in the fourth quarter. What do you expect it to be up going forward? And as I look out there, the 100 bps margin uptick I haven't calculated exactly looks like less than a 25% incremental margin. So how come it's not better as we get out to 2024?
Phebe Novakovic: Well R&D, we expect to be about $100 million for next year, but let Jason give you a little bit of color.
Jason Aiken: Yes, so as Phebe said, roughly $100 million increase in the Gulfstream R&D for 2022 as we continue to progress, as you'd expect to the flight test program on the G700. If you normalize for that delta, margins for next year would be roughly 14% for the Aerospace group. So that really does kind of answer the question on incremental margins I think from our perspective. Otherwise, we do continue to see, as you'd expect, the incremental profit from in-production airplanes 500 and 600 in particular, continuing to be additive to the group's margin. So …
Cai von Rumohr: Sure. And the last one …
Phebe Novakovic: It is a pretty good margin in the out years.
Cai von Rumohr: They are. R&D credit, how big are you assuming?
Jason Aiken: So, as I said, we're looking without the R&D credit deferral, meaning assuming existing law persists, we'll be in the call at 100% plus conversion range. If the R&D credit is deferred -- current law is deferred, we're talking more in the 110% range. So that kind of gives you a size on what we're expecting.
Operator: The next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Phebe, the four higher deliveries in '22 that you spoke about, are they G700 or what's the status? Because I know, you thought that you deliver some G700s in the fourth quarter.
Phebe Novakovic: What we said I think is that we expected the certification in the fourth quarter with -- but I think the way I have, as I noted in my remarks, we're going to have some prebuild, about the 700s and the 800s, which we'll deliver shortly thereafter, the 700s little shortly thereafter the certification.
Jason Aiken: And a little more color on that, George. I mean, just to think about it, obviously, we talked about, as Phebe said, fourth quarter certification and EIS of the 700. But there's also obviously with 2021, you have 500 -- excuse me, 550s that were delivered in the early part of the year that doesn't replicate. So, the incremental four is an offset of that decline as well as the test airplanes that Phebe mentioned that we delivered last year and some demonstrators, but otherwise steady increases in all of the in-production models, particularly 600 and 500. So, I think overall, if you look at in-production airplanes 650, 600 and 500, 280, we're looking at somewhere in the 15% year-over-year increase in production in those models. So that should give you some color on what's driving that increase.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then one follow-up. There's a $211 million difference between when you have this gross orders, and effectively just the net orders. Now were there any cancellations, there reflecting the fact that some customers are getting the planes later than they would like to get or …?
Phebe Novakovic: No, I don't think there was any particular driver. We have, I think three cancellations, but for no particular reason other than idiosyncratic customer issues.
Operator: The next question comes from Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, could you comment on the …
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning, Myles.
Myles Walton: … price environment for building out the backlog and I imagine you're now coming pretty close to lists on all of your programs. And maybe give us an impression of the skyline or the lead time for the large cabin miles at this point? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So, we've enjoyed some pricing pressure or some pricing increases and that's all good and wholesome, and we are quite comfortable where prices are. And our lead times within all production aircraft are well within the 24 or 18 months -- more than 18 months to 24 in that range that we like to see.
Myles Walton: Okay, great. And 500 versus 600, can you just give a color on the two differences in demand there. And one might be particularly accretive on the 600, given the assembly commonality with the platform.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, so just to give you a little bit of background there, the 600 were the parade in the fourth quarter, followed by the 650 and the 500. The 600 margins are obviously quite nice and 500 are improving. And of course, 600, we've always enjoyed good or 650, we've always enjoyed good margins. So, we're seeing some very nice operating margins at the gross margins at the airplane level.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Thanks very much. Phebe, maybe you can touch on some other issues. I just wonder if you can maybe give us some more clarity on the supply chain at this point and some of the obstacles you've been facing across the company whether they're getting any better.
Phebe Novakovic: So, let me go group by group. In Combat, we haven't had seen any particular supply chain issues. At Gulfstream, we've managed the supply chain, and I think they were benefited by our reduction in production last year. So, we're quite comfortable with where they are. We reported pretty fulsomely on the Mission Systems challenges that they had with chip shortages and other key product material. And Electric Boat, in particular, we've seen some challenges in the submarine supply chain, largely manifests in Virginia scheduled variants. So, we’ve pretty widely reported that, but we're continuing to work with the Navy and to kind of shore up that supply chain, so we can get normalized Virginia schedules.
Robert Stallard: Okay. And then maybe a follow-up to Myles's question on the Aerospace lead times. I think you just said 24 months is what you're seeing, in some case. That sounds a bit longer than what we've maybe heard in recent years. Are you seeing any customers, essentially saying that's too long, and maybe going somewhere else to get their jets?
Phebe Novakovic: No, we haven't. And as I said, 18 to 24, but 24 is only a handful of cases. But we haven't had any customers say well, I'll go elsewhere, because we're in the backlog, I'm going to go elsewhere cancel my order because I want my airplane faster. And frankly, we're ramping up production to accommodate that demand, that backlog and what we see is a nice solid demand going forward. So, we're quite comfortable where we are in our lead times.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Just sticky -- Phebe, sticking with supply chain and labor, can you frame the risk to entry into service for the three new aircraft programs, the 700, 800 and the 400? And how we should think about potential slippage or whether you've got that covered at this point?
Phebe Novakovic: Well with respect to labor, we've seen some wage increases in engineering forced at Gulfstream, but we have covered those with some increasing prices to offset that. But we don't see any labor issues with respect to the delivery of these airplanes. And as I say the supply chain has been pretty stable here .
Robert Spingarn: On labor affecting or clearances affecting technologies at all, is it limiting growth?
Phebe Novakovic: So, GDIT, particularly in the tech industry, any company that got large exposure to tech here, experts has certainly have their challenges and mobility, but I will say GDIT is holding up very nicely, attrition is at pre-pandemic levels. So, we're holding our own, but very mindful, this is a valuable workforce and coveted by many.
Robert Spingarn: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you. At the Gulfstream, when you described a pretty high-class problem here in terms of demand. And when you get out to 2023 and 2024, though, you have a pretty diverse set of programs at that point. How do you look at this in terms of both your operations and the supply chain, just to manage that complexity?
Phebe Novakovic: So, one thing that Gulfstream -- one of the many things that Gulfstream has been quite good at is managing its operations and having very strong operating leverage. And we have brought the supply chain along with us. So, all of our estimates that we're giving you fully accounting for what we expect the supply chain to be able to manage as well as our own operations. So, we're quite comfortable that we do not have an operating challenge.
Douglas Harned: So, no, you're not really seeing any additional issues with this mix when you get out in that timeframe.
Phebe Novakovic: No?
Operator: The next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Phebe, I'll take a question …
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Sheila.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: … in 24 months. I'll wait for it. Hi. So, I'm going to ask about Aero because it is a lot of the EPS expansion we have between '21 and '24. So, you've been so generous with your comments, but I can't quite square away Aerospace margins for 2022. And I was wondering if you could help a little bit with that just given pricing should be a tailwind. And I think mix improved from '21. You have a 500, 600 going up the curve. And I think you previously talked about the G700 being accretive to margins right away. So maybe, can you talk about what's changed? And how do we think about that improvement into '23 and '24? And I know you already guided, but if you could square it away a little bit more?
Jason Aiken: Yes, I mean, I think you've got a lot of the basic building blocks, we probably have to compare spreadsheets to see what's driving the ultimate outcome. I think the single biggest issue is probably the period-to-period fluctuation in our net R&D expenditures, right, between supporting the development programs and the net offsets that we get from time-to-time from suppliers. As I mentioned before, we've got about $100 million increase in R&D from -- in '22, relative to '21. So that if you normalize for that you're up from 12 -- 12.7 in 2021 to 14% plus in 2022. There's other puts and takes within that, as you know, pricing is a little better, the improvements along the manufacturing lines for 500 and 600 continue to get better growth in service business, obviously, which continues a pace year-over-year, while at good margins does come at margins that are in an aggregate dilutive to the overall group margin and certainly to new aircraft production margins. And so that's really the story I think, in terms of the puts and takes going into 2022. I think we can get into your details or your question maybe after the fact on '23 and '24. But I think 200 basis points improvement in '23 and another 100 basis point in '24. That kind of gives you that trajectory that we've talked about for some time about returning to the mid to high teens margins for the group. When you combine that with pretty significant top line growth that Phebe described, I think it's a pretty -- I think it's a pretty compelling story.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Can I just ask the follow-up on the R&D? Obviously, it peaks for G700 this year. When do we see that for the 400 and the 800? So, obviously, the 800 comes in -- into play shortly after the 700. So, you should kind of expect to see that following a similar pattern. I think we said the 400 enters service in 2025. So, keep in mind the 400 is an airplane that benefited significantly from commonality with the 500 and 600 in the way those airplanes were designed and engineered. So, we won't necessarily see as much of a blip associated with that, but all of this fits over time within the profile of our ongoing commitment to R&D and roughly 2% of sales for R&D. Again, it can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, but that's how you ought to see it play out.
Operator: The next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yes. Good morning, Phebe, Jason. Nice results. Phebe, I wanted to ask you a question about Marine. How are they doing in terms of battling kind of the labor shortages out there. I know Pratt yesterday talked about having a shortage of welders, maybe what you could give some commentary how you're seeing that?
Phebe Novakovic: So, we have worked for many years with our state and local governments to provide them pretty robust training programs that are still up and running. We are hiring this year at an accelerated rate over what we had anticipated, largely because of the backlog. In terms of hiring in COVID, obviously constrained. These are hiring levels for '22 at levels we have seen before and executed before. So, the question is all about the efficiency of your training programs. And we're pretty comfortable that once we get these people in the door, we can get them trained and have them go as new shipbuilders. They've got learning curves, obviously, as they get more proficient and become veterans, but we factored all of that in our thinking.
Peter Arment: Appreciate that. And just as a follow-up to some -- just on Aerospace. It sounds like the customer base continues to expand, how would you kind of characterize it? Is it a lot of the corporates that are renewing? Are you seeing just a complete expansion during this kind of COVID -- post-COVID period?
Phebe Novakovic: So, to give you a little bit of additional color on that, demand was quite good in the United States and also increased throughout the rest of the world we saw as we had begun to see earlier, a return to the Fortune 500 as well as private companies as well as smaller companies. So, it's pretty robust across the portfolio and the kinds of both individuals that we see, but also companies that we see. But I don't see any structural change here, if that's kind of what you're poking at in terms of .
Operator: The next question …
Phebe Novakovic: Go ahead, I’m sorry.
Operator: The next -- apologies, the next question comes from Seth Seifman from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much …
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Seth.
Seth Seifman: … and good morning. Maybe if I could dig in for a couple of more Aerospace details. There any comments you could give about the services assumptions underlying the guidance, and also the CapEx impact and timing of completion of the additional wing capacity?
Phebe Novakovic: So, I'll answer those in the inverse order, almost negligible CapEx. So, this is just simply a timing of -- timing issue of expanding an existing building somewhat and getting in place the tools and fixtures to effectuate the increased production. On the service side, we expect '22 to see some nice service growth at Gulfstream as well as Jet Aviation which have a nice year as well. And we expect service volume quite naturally to grow with the expanding fleet. And we have included those assumptions on a going forward basis.
Seth Seifman: Great, thanks. And just as a follow-up, definitely heard earlier and appreciate the commentary about the multiyear outlook being conservative. I guess any other sort of support you can give to that characterization would be great. If we look at, I guess, if the backlog remains stable at about $16 billion, looking at like 1.3x coverage out in 2024. And if that's kind of what you're aiming for, and any other color that kind of gives you confidence in the conservatism of the outlook?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, so think about it this way. What I wanted to explain is that the guidance that we are giving you for '23 and '24, was based on a 1 to 1 book-to-bill. Clearly, if it's better than that, we'll increase production accordingly. But for planning purposes, that's what we have assumed and I think that's prudent planning.
Operator: The next question comes from David Strauss …
Seth Seifman: So maybe just -- go ahead.
Phebe Novakovic: David?
Operator: The next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Okay. Phebe, can you hear me?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. Loud and clear.
David Strauss: Okay. So, you give us a little bit of a longer-term outlook for Gulfstream. I want to ask about Marine and Combat. I think, Marine, you'd previously said expect kind of $400 million to $500 million in incremental revenue a year. Last year, you were at the high end of that, this year you're forecasting a little bit below that. So maybe if you could update us there on kind of the longer-term thinking. And then on Combat, I think you had said kind of low growth over the next couple of years. Now you're talking about a decline. So, what's the longer-term view, I guess, on Combat? And how much could the fiscal '22 budget that still yet to be decided, but it looks pretty good for you guys how that might influence things?
Phebe Novakovic: So, let's talk about Marine. We have for some time said that we expected revenue growth in the $400 million to $500 million range. We still expect that. Next year is a little bit later, a $300 million increase and that's largely just workload timing. When I go to Combat -- so I think what we are anticipating is some decrease in pressure on the army budget. Look, we're  in '23, in particular, so we're pretty early on in the budget for that fiscal year. We don't have full OMB or tax back. But I think that the pressures on the army budget have been very well articulated. And while we expect that ultimately the funding levels for our platform programs will be sufficient and relatively stable, we will see some rather dramatic drop offs in O&M funded accounts, like maintenance, for example. So, we are factoring all of that into what I see is that increased army pressure. We're factoring all of that into our estimate for between 1% and 3% lower growth this year, but we anticipate growth returning as a number of these international orders come in a couple of years as well as new army start. So, I think we have given you a balanced and realistic view of combat.
David Strauss: Okay. A quick follow-up, what are you assuming for CR this year in terms of what's -- what you're baked into your defense guidance?
Phebe Novakovic: So, for this particular CR, given our portfolio and the prior year funding levels, we don't see a material impact of all, almost nothing.
Operator: The next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: You already got me. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: You’ve already got David. I need to get .
Operator: My apologies. We have Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Matt Akers: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. There was some commentary around the budget discussions about potentially going to the three a year on Virginia class. Could you comment on how feasible that is and sort of what further investments required? What kind of time frame that might be possible?
Phebe Novakovic: So, we've been talking to our navy customer and clearly, some investments would be required. But I think, too, at the moment, we need to get the supply chain stabilized on the two-a-year cadence before we actually think about really ramping up to three. It is doable. We just need some time for that supply chain to adjust from the ravages of COVID.
Matt Akers: Great, thanks. And I guess a couple of details within the cash flow outlook for '22. Can you say how big the impact of that prebuild is that you discussed at Gulfstream and then also can you just update what's the latest on the large international receivable? And is that meaningful as an impact for 2022?
Jason Aiken: Yes. I think on the Gulfstream side, while we are having, as Phebe mentioned, the ramp-up on the 700 and the prebuild on the 800, that's not a material impact that we see in terms of the headwind. Gulfstream wants to be a nice producer of cash again this year. Obviously, not quite to the extent that last year, we -- as we mentioned, we sold off the inventory, in particular, in the test airplanes. So, it won't have quite the trajectory it did last year, but it will still be a nice contributor on cash. So, don't see that as a headwind. On the international side, the international Canadian vehicle program we've talked about for some time remains on track. That program is in a great position, both in terms of the vehicle and the performance of the production line, and we continue to receive payments as scheduled for the renegotiated extension of that contract that occurred back in 2020. So, all in a good place in that regard.
Howard Rubel: Operator, we will take one last question. Please go ahead.
Operator: Thank you. So, our final question then comes from Richard Safran from Seaport Global. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Hi. Good morning, Phebe, Jason and Howard. How are you?
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Richard Safran: So, on Technologies, I was impressed by that $32 billion comment that you made. What percent of that is adjudicated in '22? Is it all of it? And would you be able to tell me how much of that is recompetes? And I asked because I'm assuming that recompetes come with a bit of a higher win probability.
Phebe Novakovic: Those are largely new work in the $32 billion and the customer adjudicates that as they get to it. But I think we've recognized as well that not only is the customer decision cycle, but it's also their protests that affect the timing of any of these wins, and they're significant.
Richard Safran: Yes. And just as a very quick follow-up here. Jason, I heard your opening comments about what you were going to do with debt. And I wanted to know, just to be clear, your fourth quarter maturities, is that the extent of debt reduction this year? And if you would, longer term, could you just tell me what your overall debt reduction target is? And when do you think you might be able to get there?
Jason Aiken: Yes. The $1 billion that matures in November of this year is the only maturity this year. So, you've got that right. In terms of the longer term, we will obviously play that out as it goes. We've indicated that we have a reasonable debt laddered out over the next several years that offers us the opportunity to continue to step down the debt in, call it, $1 billion to $1.5 billion increments over time. That said, we've never indicated we were going to go back to the essentially zero net debt that we had before the CSRA acquisition. So somewhere in that period with flexibility remaining open, we will decide where the right point is to settle out on that. And frankly, if there's an overarching sort of guiding light that we have around that, it's continuing to target and try to sustain a mid-A credit rating. And obviously, there's a lot of factors that go into that, but that's really sort of the compass that we have around the debt trajectory.
Howard Rubel: Well, thank you all for joining our call today. And as a reminder, please refer to our website for the fourth quarter earnings release and our highlights presentation, which will now include our outlook. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you. Katie?
Operator: Thank you all for joining. This now concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Howard Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.
 We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, our earnings press release and our filings with the SEC, all of these which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.
 With that completed, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. 
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.07 per diluted share on revenue of $9.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net earnings of $860 million. We beat consensus by $0.09 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is up about 40 basis points more than anticipated. This led to the earnings beat.
 Revenue is up 1.5% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were up less than 1%. Net earnings are up 3.1%, and earnings per share are up 5.9%. This is all reasonably good, but the real story for us is the sequential results. Here, we beat last quarter revenue by 3.8%, operating earnings by 12.6%, net earnings by 16.7%, and EPS by 17.6%.
 On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $733 million or 2.7%. Operating earnings are up $137 million or 4.8%, net earnings are up $140 million, and earnings per share are up $0.64, a strong 8.5%.
 We had a powerful quarter from a cash perspective. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.47 billion. That is 171% in net earnings. Free cash flow was $1.275 billion, 148% of net income. This follows a very strong cash quarter performance in the second quarter. In summary, we enjoyed a good quarter in almost all important respects.
 So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason give you additional color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash and then answer your questions. 
 First, Aerospace. At the outset, let me remind you that in April of last year, we announced that we were cutting production as a result of certain supply chain issues. Shortly thereafter, it became clear that there was a reduction in demand related to COVID. That resulted in additional cuts to production. Those production cuts were preplanned and implemented slowly over the ensuing months and reached their low point in the second quarter of this year.
 We had anticipated renewed post-COVID demand in the second half of this year and planned increased production for the second half with 32 planned deliveries in the third quarter and 39% in the fourth quarter. In fact, demand accelerated in mid-February, a full 4 months earlier than we had anticipated. This created opportunities but also operations and supply chain challenges for us, particularly for 2022. On balance, it is a rich problem to have.
 With that, let me turn to the Aerospace results in the quarter. Aerospace had revenue of $2.07 billion and operating earnings of $262 million, with a 12.7% operating margin. We managed delivery of 31 aircraft as opposed to the 32 planned, 1 slipped into the fourth quarter on customer preference. Revenue is $91 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 4.6% on 1 fewer aircraft delivered.
 On the other hand, operating earnings are down $21 million on a 160 basis point degradation in margins. This was the result of an additional $28 million in G&A expenses driven by higher R&D expense and around a $20 million settlement of a supplier claim related to the allocation of warranties after the end of G550 production. This was offset, but only in part, by improved gross margins on delivered aircraft and better margins in the Gulfstream service centers.
 The real story here is the quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement. Sales, earnings and margins are ramping up as planned. I will not dwell on these numbers. They are available in the charts attached to the press release. From an order perspective, this quarter boarded on the spectacular. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 1.6:1. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. The second quarter was the strongest order quarter in the number of units that we have seen in quite some time. This quarter was slightly better.
 As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the first quarter. The pipeline that developed in that quarter rolled over into the second quarter and increased demand continued through the third quarter. We continue to experience a high level of interest activity and a solid pipeline. As a result of the order activity, Gulfstream backlog this quarter is the highest in the last 6 years.
 From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis, and quality is excellent. We have delivered 131 of these aircraft to customers through the end of the quarter with 20 scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter. These are the metrics of a successful program building further momentum.
 The G700 has approximately 1,800 test hours on the 5 test aircraft. The new Rolls-Royce engine is performing well, but much remains to be accomplished. We remain on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the G800 to follow in 6 to 9 months.
 As I mentioned earlier, we had planned 32 deliveries in the third quarter and came up on short. The slip was attributable to customer preference. We had planned for 39 in the fourth and LAD-1 that slipped into the quarter. If everything goes as planned, we will deliver 40 aircraft in the fourth quarter.
 The story in Combat Systems quarter-over-quarter sequential and year-to-date is all about operating excellence and continued strong margin performance. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.745 billion, down 3.1% from the year ago quarter. However, earnings are up 2.2% over the year ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, yet another example of strong operating leverage from Combat Systems.
 Further that theme on a year-to-date basis, Combat System revenue was up $201 million or 3.8%, while operating earnings are up a significant 7.4% on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins. Demand for our combat vehicles remained stable in the U.S., with a brigade of Abrams main battle tanks per year and half a brigade of Strykers per year. Domestic upside is possible from the MPF program where our vehicle is performing well.
 In the near term, we are stable internationally but opportunity rich in the intermediate period with order potential in Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Denmark and Switzerland. You may have read in the press about some noise and vibration issues in Ajax that have emerged during the programs test phase. We are working very closely with both the British Army and the Ministry of Defense and are confident that both technical issues can be resolved. In summary, this quarter was an impressive operating performance once again by the Combat Systems Group.
 Turning to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.64 billion is up $232 million, above 9.6% over the year ago quarter. The current quarter revenue growth was distributed fairly evenly across the 3 shipyards. It is also up sequentially and year-to-date. Year-to-date revenue was up 7.5%. This is very impressive continued growth. In fact, revenue in this group has been up for the last 16 quarters on a quarter over year ago quarter basis.
 Operating earnings are $229 million in the quarter, up $6 million or 2.7% on an operating margin of 8.7%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are up $19 million, on a 40 basis point improvement in margins. Electric Boats performance remained strong, and while still early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule.
 We had a particularly strong quarter in our ship repair business, continuing to support our Navy customer. Throughout the group, we have a solid backlog of new construction and repair work, and our programs are well supported in the FY '22 budget. In summary, revenue growth is clearly visible. The real opportunity given this steady revenue visibility is margin improvement over time.
 Moving to Technologies. This segment had revenue of $3.120 billion in the quarter, down $130 million from the year ago quarter or 4%. The revenue decrease was attributable to Mission Systems from timing on several programs in part driven by chip shortages. On the other hand, Information Technology grew revenue against the year ago quarter at a rate of 1.4%.
 Operating earnings of $327 million are up $13 million or 4.1% on a 10.5% operating margin. EBITDA margin is a truly impressive 14.4%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Most of our competitors carry state and local taxes below the line. This quarter revenues decrease will impact the year, and we now expect revenue to be around $12.6 billion or $400 million less than our second quarter update. Earnings will, however, remain the same on better margins.
 Total backlog remains relatively consistent over all comparator periods, so good order activity in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon. The book-to-bill at GDIT was a little better than 1:1 and somewhat less in Mission Systems. The pipeline remains active at both businesses.
 From an opportunity perspective, cybersecurity is a top priority throughout the government and the budget calls for tens of billions of dollars in unclassified spending in both the defense and civil spaces. This is a significant opportunity for which we are well positioned to support our customers' needs, particularly as more and more customers move toward a 0 trust model.
 So that concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter and first 9 months. As we look toward the end of the year, we expect performance to be in line with the update to guidance that we gave you on the last call, except as I referenced in my remarks about Mission Systems. However, EPS guidance remains unchanged.
 I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks. 
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $1.5 billion in the quarter, once again on the strength of Gulfstream orders and from continued strong cash performance from our Technology segment.
 Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.3 billion or a 148% net earnings conversion. Through the first 9 months, our conversion rate is 91%, approaching our full year outlook for free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. For those of you who followed us for some time, this performance through the first 9 months of the year is better than we've seen in the past several years and gives us good line of sight to achieving the upper end of our target cash range for the year.
 Looking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $196 million in the quarter or 2% of sales. That puts us a little under the 2% of sales for the first 9 months, so trending somewhat below our forecast for the year. We're still projecting full year CapEx in the range of 2.5% of sales. So that obviously implies an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter. We also paid $332 million in dividends and spent $117 million on the repurchase of 600,000 shares in the quarter. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 8.5 million shares at an average price of just under $174 per share.
 We repaid $500 million of notes that matured in July. And although there were no new issuances, we ended the quarter with $2 billion of commercial paper outstanding. We expect to fully retire that balance before the end of the year. So we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of just over $3.1 billion and a net debt position of $10.5 billion, down more than $800 million from last quarter and down $1.4 billion from this time last year.
 With the scheduled CP repayment in the fourth quarter, we expect to end the year with a net debt balance below $10 billion for the first time since 2018. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $99 million, down from $118 million in the third quarter of 2020. That brings the net interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $331 million, down from $357 million for the same period in 2020.
 The tax rate in the quarter was 15.3%, bringing our rate to 15.9% for the first 9 months, consistent with our full year outlook, which remains around 16%. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the third quarter, with a 0.9x book-to-bill for the company as a whole, bringing us to a 1:1 ratio for the first 9 months and a 1.2x ratio for the trailing 12 months. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.6x book-to-bill in the quarter, while technologies recorded a book-to-bill of one-to-one. 
 Foreign exchange rate fluctuation resulted in a $300 million reduction in backlog in the quarter, with the majority of that impact in Combat Systems. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $88.1 billion. That's up 8% over this time last year, and total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $129.6 billion.
 That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Howard to start the Q&A. 
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Jason. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Myles Walton of UBS. 
Myles Walton: Phebe, I wonder, could you talk a bit about the transition potential margin impact of the new generation of the 400 and the 800 coming online? It seems like the 800 is a pretty advantageous move for the 650 engine with the 700 engines. And you usually would expect some level of reset on margins, but I'm curious if that reset will be materially lighter than we'd normally expect with the new entry into service. 
Phebe Novakovic: So we get a fair number of questions on this, so I think it's worthwhile walking through each element here. And first, let's take a look at margins. I'll make some comments that I'd like, Jason, to maybe elucidate a couple of points, and then we'll get into a little bit of earnings. So when you think about margins and the new product development, at present, we have about 3 models in production, soon to be joined by the 700. The 800 replaces the 650, and the 400 comes later.
 Importantly, we have all the modern plant property and equipment to do everything we need to do. We need to add some more CapEx to undergird the increase in wing production. Remember, we're doing all of our wings. But here's the important part, and it goes to the design for producibility that we built into these airplanes and the implied productivity that's embedded in that design for producibility.
 And remember, too, we are seeing margin improvement in every single one of our airplanes in services. This now tells you -- and again, I think it shines the spotlight on the operating leverage of Gulfstream. But to amplify all of that and really give an additional uplift, remember, all these aircraft are related. They all have the Symmetry flight deck. The G700 and 800 are the same engine and wings and the same basic fuselage. The G400 and 500, 600 have the same engines or similar engines from the same family from 1 supplier and the same basic fuselage. So this commonality align -- allowed us to design for producibility, which is going to be an uplift to our margins.
 Now if we unpack that a little bit, we get an awful lot of questions about R&D. And I'd like Jason to talk a little bit more, and perhaps not for all but for some, a bit of a tutorial on R&D accounting. 
Jason Aiken: Yes. So to Phebe's point, we get a lot of questions around will this new product investment have any impact on the overall R&D spend and what does that do to margins over time. And as a reminder, we have a long-term steady commitment and demonstrated performance of investing in Gulfstream's product development and new technologies over time. So I think if you look over a multiyear period, we've averaged company-sponsored R&D in the call it, roughly 1% of sales range, and we don't expect that to change.
 Largely, the 800, I wouldn't say it's behind us, but it's been part and parcel to that spend over time. R&D is spent as a period expense over time. As Phebe mentioned, the G400, while a clean sheet airplane is part of the 500 and 600 development, and so the commonality among those helps keep that spend down. And so both of those airplanes are right within that profile of R&D spend. I think to the extent you see any lumpiness in R&D as we did this quarter, and we'll expect to see a little bit next quarter, that has more to do with supplier offsets that we receive. You're probably familiar with those where suppliers contribute to the program development efforts. And those come in lumps and chunks, so that tends to create the quarterly perturbations and R&D spend.
 But overall, the period expense for these programs, including the 2 that were announced this month, are right inside that line of company-sponsored R&D. So we don't expect that or the -- frankly, the introduction once they come to have an overall impact in the margin improvement trajectory that we see for Gulfstream over time. 
Phebe Novakovic: So what does all that mean if you step back? So margins this year are at their low point in aerospace. Next year margins will improve, and '23 margins will improve. Earnings were better in '21 than they were last year. They're going to be better in '22 and '23.
 And by the way, when we give you guidance on the next call, we're going to give you some color and some insight into both of those years to help explain and amplify again what we're looking at, at Gulfstream. So I hope that helps answer your question, Myles. 
Operator: We'll now move on to our next question, which will be coming from David Strauss. 
David Strauss: Phebe, I wanted to ask you, you highlighted that the Gulfstream backlog is the highest it's been in about 6 years. I think if I just take kind of the aircraft revenue, you've got something like 2.5 years in backlog based on today. So how -- and at the same time, you also comment on supply chain challenges. So how do you balance all that as you think about where production rates go at Gulfstream? 
Phebe Novakovic: So the increased demand supports increased production. We'll get into all of that specificity on the next call. But as I noted, after we reduced production last year in response to COVID, supply chain challenges that were in large part driven by COVID and COVID demand, the supply chain needs to gear back up. So there's a little bit of a headwind. But that's why I wanted to give you the color around the margin and earnings performance. 
David Strauss: Okay. But all that being said, we should see higher production in '22 and '23? 
Phebe Novakovic: We're anticipating that to drive a higher revenue. So as I said in my remarks, this is a rich problem to have. I wanted to be as transparent with you as possible to tell you, hey, look, we've got this. There's a nice strong backlog. We've got very good demand, a continuing demand. But as we ramp up, and we will be ramping up, there are some challenges. We can manage those challenges and manage through them, but I thought it was important that you guys understand that. 
Operator: We're now going to move over to Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. 
Robert Stallard: Phebe, I was wondering if you could elaborate on these challenges. You obviously face some chip issues in Mission Systems, but it seems you're also conscious of some potential headwinds in the aerospace division that ramps up. And one of your peers also talked about broader supply chain challenges in its Defense business. I was wondering if you could comment on this topic generally and what you could be seeing in the future. 
Phebe Novakovic: So I tried to give you some measured look at the Aerospace issues. But on supply chain, the chip shortage impacted Mission Systems. I would note how -- and we do expect that to go into next year somewhat. I would note, however, even since the close of the quarter, they have begun to significantly mitigate some of those chip impacts. But across the portfolio of our defense businesses, we are not seeing significant or even material supply chain challenges. So we've been able to manage through that pretty well. So for us, and I can only speak for us, that hasn't been a significant issue other than its impact at technologies and driven by Mission Systems. 
Robert Stallard: Yes. And in aerospace, the challenge is there. Is that just a lead time issue with suppliers? Or is it specific parts that you're finding particularly tight? 
Phebe Novakovic: It's primarily a lead time. The fact that we pulled down last year adds a little bit of headwind to the increase in production that we see on a going-forward basis. But I don't see any particular problems at the moment impacting that. This is really just a timing issue and getting folks back up to speed. 
Operator: We're now going to move over to Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. 
Cai Von Rumohr: Yes. So Phebe, could you give us some color on demand at Gulfstream, specifically high net worth versus corporate versus fractional? And most importantly, are you seeing any opportunity for improved pricing in this sector? 
Phebe Novakovic: Let me answer those in the inverse order. We have seen some upward pressure on pricing, and then let me unpack your demand. So look, our own view of our increased demand is a combination of factors. One, the very attractive product mix, a strong economy, the return of the Fortune 1000, increase high net worth individuals. And in fact, COVID did create in pockets some wealth creation and the pent-up demand that's built up during the pandemic. The demand is -- and I think importantly is spread evenly pretty much across our product line. And there's nothing unusual to report on customer mix or geographic distribution other than the North America was quite, quite strong. 
Operator: And we're now going to move to Ron Epstein of Bank of America. 
Ronald Epstein: Just maybe changing gears a little bit. I think everybody is going to focus on bizjet, so I'm going to maybe not do that. A while back, there was some discussion... 
Phebe Novakovic: Oh my, how innovative. 
Ronald Epstein: Imagine that, right? There were some discussion in the press around the Polish defense ministry purchasing some Abrams tanks and 1 Abrams. I think maybe 250 of them, if I remember right. Where does that stand? And if you can give some color on that and maybe some of the other international business going on in the Land Systems business. 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So we're working very closely with our customer as well as the Department of Defense to support a potential order of 250 tanks out of Poland. If we -- and frankly, this is a powerful system for the polls to have given their geographic location and their historical experience, particularly with folks stream and West. So if we think through again the FMS process, and this is an FMS sale, we're looking at somewhere between maybe in the 2-year period. 
 But just to give you a little bit of additional color we see increased demand signals coming out of Czech Republic, Romania, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain and, of course, the Middle East. The world hasn't gotten any safer. 
Operator: We'll now move over to our next question from Richard Safran of Seaport Research Partners. 
Richard Safran: Phebe, Jason, Howard, with such great cash flow performance, I wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about capital deployment, invest in the business, dividends, repurchases, commercial paper. Now, Jason, I heard your remarks about retiring commercial paper. But as we look ahead, are you thinking about maintaining your current strategy? Or are you considering any changes? I think in the past, you've stated you invest in the business depending on need and that dividend should be repeatable. But I was just curious if there's any update here on how you're thinking about it. 
Phebe Novakovic: So let me give you the strategic framework, and then Jason can fill in any specifics. But essentially, our capital deployment strategy remains unchanged. We invest opportunistically in small acquisitions or in investments to grow the business where we can get a good capital return, return on our capital. Dividends and opportunistic share repurchase. This has been our strategy from the day 1 and the advent of this management team. Jason? 
Jason Aiken: Yes. I think the only thing I'd add to your point on the commercial paper repayment and future priorities around debt is that commercial paper will mature here in the fourth quarter. We've got more than sufficient cash on hand, so we'll just repay that in normal course as it comes due. 
 The next debt maturity is in late next year. I think it's around $1 billion that will come due. So no real imminent issues there, so we can focus on the priorities Phebe mentioned. And then as those elements of the debt ladder do mature, we'll pay those down in due course up to  a point until we get to a comfortable place that we think long term continues to support our target mid-A credit rating for the company. 
Operator: We'll now be taking our next question from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. 
Seth Seifman: Phebe, when you think about the certification timeline for the 700 and the 800, I guess, is there anything you'd point out to as a long pole in the tent? And thinking specifically about the engine certification, which you mentioned today, and then also the changes in ODA that Steve Dickson outlined last week testifying before Congress. 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So our estimate at the moment still remains late next year for the 700, with the 800 to follow 6 to 9 months later. For those of you who have followed engine certification for years and decades, some of you, you'll know that they are always challenging. This engine is performing extremely well in terms of its capability in either meeting or outperforming its design specification. We've got a lot of test growth on a going-forward basis to get through. 
 So we don't see any particular issues at the moment, but we are mindful that these are always complex and challenging processes to work through. And we've adapted to changes in the -- in our regulators in the FAA's game book before. And at the moment, we don't see any reason to adjust our estimates. But if we do, we'll let you know. 
Seth Seifman: Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up for Jason. If you could update us on where you expect to be on working capital at the end of this year and then kind of maybe without specific guidance, just what the opportunity buckets are in working capital for '22. 
Jason Aiken: Sure. I think as you can see from the exhibits this morning, working capital was a benefit, call it, in the couple of $300 million or $400 million in the quarter. That is largely from the performance at Gulfstream, the significant order activity that we've seen throughout the year and the quarter as well as the continued sale of the last of the test articles from the 500 and 600 program. So that really is the big benefit in the quarter.
 Working capital is still a bit of a headwind year-to-date, just as the business grows and we work through some of that. But I think as you look ahead, we would expect to see working capital to continue to be a benefit in the fourth quarter and beyond as we get back to that 100% conversion level this year. We're approaching that level this year and certainly expect to get above 100% conversion next year. So part of that is the continued demand cadence at Gulfstream. Once we get through the 700 program, we would look to sell off those test articles as well. 
 And then, of course, you've got the ongoing benefits at Combat Systems. You've seen us achieve a regular order on the large international program there in Combat Systems. And that will continue to be a tailwind, really even more of a tailwind, I think, into '22 as well as into '23. So those are some of the major movers.
 The other side of it, of course, is where we should be peaking this year in terms of the capital expenditure investment profile in Marine Systems. So that will start to come down next year and return more to the normal historical level we see by 2023. So those are really the big movers there and should give you a sense of where we ought to see the working capital moving over the next 2, 3 years. 
Operator: Our next question will be from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. 
Kristine Liwag: Phebe and Howard and Jason. Phebe, how do you anticipate the vaccine executive order will affect labor and production? And also, do you have a sense of the percentage of GD employees that are currently vaccinated? 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So before I get into the mandate, I'd like to take the opportunity to reiterate again our acknowledgment of our workforce. I think it's important to remember that we were declared a critical national infrastructure business early in the onset of the pandemic. And as a result of that, our workers stayed on the factory floor in the shipyards and in places where they were needed, frankly, throughout the pandemic. They stood their watch and, from my perspective with courage and fortitude, to produce the goods and services that are necessary for our national security. I personally am fully cognizant of the sacrifices they made, and I'm proud of the courage they showed.
 Now let me turn to the mandate. As you well know, as a federal contractor, we are covered by the executive order on the mandate. The corporate office mandate has been fully executed. Two of our largest businesses are in the process of executing the mandate, and many others are set to implement accordingly. And because of our customer, operational and geographic diversity of many of our businesses, we are working with our customers as contract modifications are received that could trigger an implementation. So we keep a pretty running tally. We're at, we believe, in some form of either full or partial vaccination in the 75% range or so. And then yes, so we understand the mandate. 
Kristine Liwag: And then maybe if I could add one on supply chain and aerospace. We're seeing that some of the suppliers also have to comply with the mandate. How are you mitigating potential supply chain issues in aerospace if you're not able to get parts? And how do you think about that with regards to your production rate plans for Gulfstream? 
Phebe Novakovic: Well, frankly, to the extent that there is an impact in the supply chain of this mandate, it will affect a lot of lines of business throughout the defense aerospace world. So I don't see a particular challenge at Gulfstream or in the moment at any of our other large lines of business. But we will certainly be mindful and deal with any workflow perturbations should they emerge.
 Look, we have a history of dealing with challenges methodically, systematically and thoroughly. So you'd expect us to approach that operating discipline and apply that operating discipline to any emerging issues that may or may not arise. 
Operator: We'll now move to our next question from Peter Arment of Baird. 
Peter Arment: Phebe, maybe just to ask on the Technologies segment, just given the strong operating performance there. Is there any -- just a clarification, is there any onetimers in the 10.5% that you had this quarter? 
Phebe Novakovic: No. 
Peter Arment: And just if not, do you view this segment being able to sustain its kind of 10% or a double-digit margin going forward or just any color around that? 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. Double-digit margin going forward. Okay? 
Peter Arment: Yes. No, I just -- any -- are you seeing any changes there or your ability to kind of manage that in terms of I know it's a very price competitive environment. 
Phebe Novakovic: No. I mean not at the moment. We've been pretty consistent in our margin performance across this entity. So I don't see any systemic change that should impact that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers of Wells Fargo. 
Matthew Akers: I wonder if you could talk about for the G400, 800, just kind of early feedback. And how much, I guess, of the demand you're seeing there, sort of customers that are sort of incremental that wouldn't have bought some of your other platforms versus potentially kind of cannibalizing some of the other aircraft? 
Phebe Novakovic: We have no instances of cannibalization to date. The 800 is ultimately a replacement for the 650. About 650 demand remains pretty steady. And the customer base is pretty much our typical customer base. There may be incremental adds here and there, but I would argue that we see that in both the 700 and 800 and frankly, the rest of that portfolio to the extent that there are incremental here and there. And this tend to be high net worth individuals or some new Fortune 1000 or 500 companies. But I think there's nothing particularly notable here in terms of being exceptional outside the norm. Other than there's a lot of good interest here. We've taken a good number of orders. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Alembic Global. 
Peter Skibitski: Phebe, I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on the fiscal '22 defense budget. There seems to be a lot of tailwind to the President's request in Congress. And I'm wondering if you could share with us if you see some of the support, incremental support, occurring to GD programs and maybe you'd wager odds if that budget could be signed into law by the end of this calendar year or not. 
Phebe Novakovic: So I think you know as much as I do, given the fulsome and in-depth reporting on congressional budget processes about the likelihood of signing, so I'm not going to go speculate on hypothetical timing. But I think, importantly, all of our major and frankly all of our programs were well supported, and some are beneficiaries of  increased spending on the part of the Congress. So all in all, we had no particular surprises, by the way, up or down. So we were quite comfortable on how this budget is being played out. 
Operator: Our next question will be coming from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. 
Noah Poponak: Phebe, the -- in the business jet market at large, the end market and investors keep debating the sustainability of this recent uptick in demand and some people feel like it's... 
Phebe Novakovic: I haven't heard a lot of that. 
Noah Poponak: Yes. Exactly. Well, you've made, I guess, the pragmatic decision to kind of not wait in there. And I guess, I just wonder if you've had enough time or you speak to so many customers, if you've heard enough from real deal new customers to perhaps have more of a view on the sustainability of what we're seeing. 
Phebe Novakovic: Well, I wouldn't be taken little about this. I think that -- and nor should anybody. I think the demand that we're seeing is, I tried to reiterate before, is across our existing customer base. The Fortune 1000 is back in force. There are, as I noted, new entrants into that market as some companies have increased their profitability over the last 2 years. And there are additional high net worth individuals who have entered into the market. 
 So I think that the data -- and I can only speak for Gulfstream. The data would suggest that given our attractive product mix as strong, as I noted earlier, strong economy and the fact that our customers are back and broad-based demand, I'm not worried at the moment about sustainability. These are -- Gulfstream is in and business jet market is in a cyclical market, driven in part no small measure by the economy. But we have been the most resilient in terms of demand through most economic cycles. So again, I think we are [ very resilient ] and we've got a good pipeline going forward. 
Noah Poponak: That's helpful. Do you have a sense, even if directionally, how many of your customers in the last 18 months are truly brand new? 
Phebe Novakovic: We're not going to parse it, but it's pretty -- we've gotten a fair number of new folks, but also our regular and historic customers. They're back on some new customers from market share increases. So as far as I'm concerned, we had very, very good demand, and the pipeline remains robust. 
 As that was our final question, I would like to hand back to Howard Rubel for any closing remarks. 
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, all, for joining us on our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any other questions, I can be reached (703) 876-3117. That will now end our call. 
Operator: This concludes the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Thank you, all, for joining, and have a great rest of your day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2021 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. With that completed, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Early this morning, we have reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $959 million, and net income of $737 million. Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year but operating earnings are up $125 million and net earnings are up $112 million, earnings per share are up $0.43. To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's second quarter by $308 million or 4.2%. Aerospace is down $352 million, pretty much as planned. Operating earnings on the defense side are up $98 million or 14.3%, and operating earnings in aerospace are up $36 million on a 390 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin for the entire company was 10.4%, 140 basis points better than the year ago quarter. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.07 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is 20 basis points lower than anticipated coupled with a somewhat lower share count, this led to the earnings feed. On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $596 million or 3.3% and operating earnings are up $129 million or 7.3%. Overall margins are up 40 basis points. The defense numbers are particularly good with revenue up $752 million or 5.2%, and operating earnings up $143 million or 10.3%. On the aerospace side of the business, revenue on a year-to-date basis is down $156 million or 4.3%, but earnings are up $16 million or 4% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. The quarter was also very strong from a cash perspective; free cash flow of $943 million is 128% of net income. Cash flow from operating activities was 151% of net income and had a very solid quarter from an earnings perspective across the board. The year-to-date results give us solid start to the year and enabled us to raise our forecast for the full year which I will share with you at the end of these remarks.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $1.1 billion on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large international Combat Vehicle contract. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow as Phebe noted was $943 million or 128% net earnings conversion. You may recall that for the past several years, our free cash flow has been heavily weighted to the back half of the year, so the strong quarter derisks that profile somewhat and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. Looking at capital deployment; I mentioned capital expenditures which were $172 million in the quarter or 1.9% of sales, that's down from last year but our full year expectation remains in the range of 2.5% of sales. We also paid $336 million in dividends and spent approximately $600 million on the repurchase of 3.3 million shares; that brings year-to-date repurchases to 7.9 million shares at an average price of just under $173 per share. We have 279.5 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. We repaid $2.5 billion of notes that matured in May, in part with proceeds from $1.5 billion in notes we issued in May. We also issued $2 billion of commercial paper during the quarter to facilitate the repayment of those notes and for liquidity saving purposes, but we expect to fully retire that CP before the end of the year.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Jason. Now let me do my best to give you an updated forecast. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I will not repeat. In Aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.4% which is 10 basis point below what we previously forecast; this will result in an additional $10 million of operating earnings. There could be some upside here if we can squeeze out a few more planes in the year. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat Systems should have another $100 million of revenue and add another 10 basis points of operating margin; so total revenue of $7.4 billion and operating margin of around 14.6%. Marine Systems has an additional $300 million and 10 basis points of improved margin, so annual revenue of $10.6 billion with an operating margin around 8.4%. Technology revenue will be down $200 million from our previous forecast but add 30 basis points of operating margin, so annual revenue of $13 billion with an operating margin of around 9.8%. So on a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue of about $39.2 billion and an overall operating margin around 10.6%, this rolls up to EPS around $11.50, $0.45 to $0.50 better than our forecast going into the year.
Howard Rubel: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.
Operator: Absolutely, sir.  Today's first question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Hi, yes. Good morning, Phebe and Jason.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Peter.
Peter Arment: Nice results. Phebe, maybe just to start with Combat and my follow-up will be related to that. Just -- maybe, could you just talk about, I think there is really strong performance that you're seeing, but also, we're seeing a lot of activity in the international market that -- for some of your key platforms. Just how you think about Combat growing in what is a domestically flatter budget environment but based on how you're doing in terms of a lot of your works ? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So domestically both of our large platform programs, and Stryker and Abrams are continuing to grow, particularly Stryker, as the army assigns new missions and capabilities to that platform. There are also, as you all know, a number of developmental programs that factor into our longer-term thinking. Externally, outside the United States, demand is increasing, primarily driven by Europe. And again, that is focused and centered on our Combat vehicles, both -- both of our wheeled vehicles, as well as our track vehicles, most specifically, the Abrams main battle tank.
Peter Arment: And just as a follow-up. Just as you talked about, I guess, some of that activity , have you -- do you expect that the discussions around recent comments around Poland, will that would be closing this year potentially?
Phebe Novakovic: So, you know, Poland's been a very dangerous neighborhood. And I think there is no stronger deterrent than the Abrams main battle tank. I think press reports have suggested that they want 250 tanks for working very closely with the U.S. government to ensure we meet whatever ultimately United States and Poland determine that they want. I think our initial estimate to close is probably good solid year plus out; but again, more to be -- more to come, and then we'll keep you informed as that program unfolds.
Peter Arment: Appreciate it. Thanks a lot for the color.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Seth.
Seth Seifman: Hi. I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned in the remarks, Phebe, about what needs to be done on the engine for the G700. And I wonder if you could tell us specifically what milestones we should be looking for? And what risks that the engine poses to the schedule for the program?
Phebe Novakovic: So as I noted, we continue to make progress on both, the airplane and the engine development; but as I'm sure you know being a student of new engine development programs, they are always difficult to get through certification, and while there is no particular issue at the time, we still have a ways to go with respect to that certification process. But at the moment, we don't have any particular issues that would impact our overall estimation of timing.
Seth Seifman: Okay, great. Thanks very much. And then, just as a follow-up. There's been a lot of discussion in the press about the AJAX program; how that's going and that it doesn't really seem to be having too much of a negative impact on the segment's financial results but -- the way that it's playing into financial performance of Combat?
Phebe Novakovic: So, our U.K. customer is constructively and actively engaged in this program, and we're working very closely with them on two issues that were identified during customer test; one is noise and one is vibration. And given our long decade-long history of Combat vehicles design and production, you know, interestingly enough, this is a transformational vehicle for the U.K. army, and with many transformational programs it has emerged during the testing process. So, we will then are dealing with both of those issues quite closely with our U.K. government customer.
Seth Seifman: Hey, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Next is Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kristine Liwag: Hi, Phebe and Jason. Phebe, can you provide more color on the type of our profile at Gulfstream or the demands from corporate or individual of U.S. versus international?
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. All in all we see a reasonable balance across the broad cross section of buyers. The U.S. had a particularly strong quarter, generating more of this quarter's orders, some of the new customers and a broadening of the market and importantly, our core Fortune 500 customers have re-engaged. So in all that the markets we are looking at the moment is robust.
Kristine Liwag: Thanks. And my follow-up is on pricing. Since there doesn't seem to be too many used jets in inventory, are you getting more pricing power for new orders?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, let's just say as a matter, of course, we never talk about pricing. So, I am not about to break my discipline, but let me let me give you a little context here. Gulfstream has always been extremely disciplined about its pricing and that long history of disciplined control around pricing will continue. Price is precious and once you on rely on your discipline around pricing, it's a long way back up the hill.
Kristine Liwag: Great. Thank you, Phebe.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please, go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Phebe, just a follow-up on that topic and the strength of the demand environment in the order intake at aerospace. At what point would you feel comfortable raising business jet production?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, we're increasing our business jet Gulfstream production rates throughout the remainder of this year. We've got 71 deliveries to go and we will, as you well know, set production for next year, in the fall of this year and then report fully to you on those production levels in next year.
Robert Stallard: Okay. And just a follow-up on the pricing issue. Are you seeing -- you might call maybe irrational -- on the new pricing front?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, that's your word, not mine. Hey look, we tend not to -- first of all we don't compete on price most importantly and I never comment on other people's behavior. That's a wise injudicious  stance to adhere to.
Robert Stallard: Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please, go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, good morning and thank you for the time, Phebe, Jason and Howard. Maybe, on mission. If we could just talk about what's going on there for a second. I appreciate the divestiture in the semiconductor chip issue, but it seems like it was flat year-over-year organically and then the book-to-bill is slightly below one. So, maybe Phebe, can you talk about what the drivers in that business are and what you're seeing?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, I think you need to look -- as you well noted, our divestiture of our SATCOM business. But I believe absent that and given the chip issue that we and others have had and that we are working assiduously to address, we have seen some growth and we anticipate some additional growth going forward. But it will be best measured.
Jason Aiken: And I think to add on to Phebe's point, assuming that business can overcome some of the supply chain issues that they've seen, which at this point they're getting good signals, that they'll be able to do in the second half. We ought to see some modest organic growth out of that business for the full year.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. And then maybe just one on Combat, that was also a really good quarter there and the first half is up, I think, 7%. It implies a deceleration into the second half. What's may be falling off there?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, I think it's a only slightly in percentage terms. We think we had originally guided to an increase burst what  impetus behind growth in the first half will repeat in the second half and that's logic and vehicle production deliveries in both the United States and outside the United States.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, thank you so much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes, Phebe. Could you commented on what services did in the quarter? I imagine it was up and what you expect for the rest of the year?
Phebe Novakovic: You mean in aerospace services?
George Shapiro: Yes in Gulfstream.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, well, our services include both jet aviation services as well as Gulfstream. So, we saw some nice order, nice recovery in the United States, but here in Middle East  and Asia recovering a little more slowly. So, I think we had anticipated about $0.5 billion increase in revenue. I think that is a bridge too far in the moment and I think we're looking more along the lines of...
Jason Aiken: Call it $375-ish million for the year at this point.
Phebe Novakovic: So, not tremendously off our original estimate, but as I said, it's the international recovery. That's been just a touch slower than we anticipated, but the U.S. has been very, very strong. Jason?
Jason Aiken: And George, on to that point, I think it's driven a nice rebound this year, I think to the tune of around 25% growth over last year and importantly, I think that some people are watching the levels we've seen through the first half of this year or within, call it 95-ish percent of where we were at this time in 2019. So, I think that's a good initial indication of the strength of the recovery in that business here in 2021.
George Shapiro: Okay. I'll stick with my one. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, George.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please, go ahead.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Doug Harned: I wanted to go back to Gulfstream because when you talk about the demand where it's obviously very good, you talked a little bit about where they're coming from. But can you give us a sense of the psychology of your customers? By that I mean, are you seeing these orders come in really as kind of pent up demand that's been slowed recently? Or are you seeing people actually think about the use of business jets differently coming out of ?
Phebe Novakovic: So, we have no evidence that there has been any fundamental shift in thinking about the use of business aviation, I think that it would be way, way, too premature to get real clarity about that. You're kind of getting a question that we've received a number of times and that goes to kind of, is there a structural change as a result of this pandemic in business aviation? And if you think critically about change, what we know is that structural change is almost never apparent prospectively. It almost always is apparent retrospectively. And so, I believe that it is premature to assume any pronouncements about structural change. Now that said, we've seen our customers are the same kinds of customers that we've had historically back in -- I think there was some slowing obviously. There was some slowing of demand last year and a number of our customers, particularly in the Fortune 500 are on their aircraft replacement cycle. That remains unchanged. We did see some new entrants into the market as some industries have expanded in the COVID environment, creating opportunities for those companies. But yes, I think psychology is an interesting word, but I think I've gotten to the essence of your question.
Doug Harned: And a little bit related to that, you described the unit book-to-bill is higher than the revenue book-to-bill. Have you seeing a mixed shift towards a smaller aircraft and what do you see driving that difference in unit versus revenue book-to-bill right now?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, we have not seen a movement particularly into the smaller jets. I think the 280 was maybe about less than that 20% of the order book and really, it's demand for both the in-service airplanes, the 500, 600, 650 and of course in 700. So, really a strong demand pull across all of our airplanes. I don't think there's anything in particular discern from that. These are our regular customers back buying to replace the airplanes in the missions that they need and they have and the airplanes that they buy, then with each one of those missions since the way we think about it.
Doug Harned: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please, go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
David Strauss: Phebe, on Gulfstream production, just to kind of level set us, you talked about it coming down  in COVID. Are you taking Gulfstream -- I guess just looking at holistically on the large cabin side and adjusting for the G550. Are you taking large-cabin production back to where we were prior to all this or above that?
Phebe Novakovic: Follow-up, we are increasing on a reasonable basis. Our production of all of our existing now airplanes and we are not back at the 2019 production levels, but to-go basis we're looking at second half orders of 71 and so that in it of itself suggests that we've got solid production I will tell you and that production plan contemplates increased production in each and every one of our in-service large-cabin fleet.
David Strauss: Okay, all right. And Jason, quick follow-up. Just given the strength of Gulfstream order activity and advances you're seeing there, could you be looking at closer to kind of 100% or maybe even a little bit above that free cash flow conversion this year?
Jason Aiken: Yes, I think, David, as I alluded to in the remarks, I think the way to think about the strength of the first half and the strength of the activity at Gulfstream is it somewhat derisks the profile for the second half and getting to that 95% to 100% range. You'll recall over the past several years, we've had a pretty steep slope in the second half on our free cash flow generation with frankly at times most, if not all, of our free cash flow for the year coming in the second half is not even most in the fourth quarter. So, that's not anything I would put together by design and I'm really encouraged by the shift in that slope that we've seen this year. So, it does give us, I think even reinforced confidence to getting to that 95% to 100% range. I think if you think about that range as a percentage of net income and combine that with Phebe's guidance on increasing net income, you can imply increasing free cash flow to support that number. And frankly, if I'm going to lean a little forward, I think it could possibly put us towards the top into that range of the 95% to 100% range. I don't know, but I'd want to get out above 100% this year. I think we still look to next year and beyond to be nicely above 100%, but bottom line, I think this reinforces improvement in overall free cash flow and maybe pushes us up towards the higher end of that 95% to 100% range.
David Strauss: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Please, go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, you talked about the 12.4% margins in aerospace and obviously in the first half, you're slightly under that, but the first quarter included a charge in the second quarter, I'm sure had production inefficiencies because of the manufacturing being close point. So I'm just curious, it would look like there is more upside in the second half, barring some pickup in in R&D or other expenses. Is that an area of conservatism that we should be ?
Phebe Novakovic: So, when we think about the second half margins, they will be better than our first half margins -- our first half margins were at low point. But we will see some negative impact from two factors. One is the absence of the 550  deliveries as that airplane is now out of service and a higher R&D as we move toward G700 certification.
Myles Walton: Okay, all right. And then, maybe just give us some color if you can, if you want to on the first availability of delivery slots, particularly on the 500, 600 at this point?
Phebe Novakovic: We got out of the practice of doing that because it became a lot less meaningless with new airplane deliveries -- with new airplanes. So, we're not going to, I think, reinstitute that.
Myles Walton: You can't go back to there?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, go back to there, but I think if you think about the environment that we're looking at now and we think we've been very clear and consistent about this -- starting really, it was in mid-February, we saw an increase in demand and it was consistent and steady throughout that first quarter that led to the order quarter you saw this quarter and second quarter. And then, as we look at both the pipeline and the market, at the moment, it is robust. So, we're seeing a return as I said, of our Fortune 500 customers, as well as new entrants and North America is quite strong. So all in all, I think we're looking at about a pretty good market.
Myles Walton: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Matt Akers, Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.
Matt Akers: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. A couple on the IT business. I guess, anything in particularly you can point to that kind of drove the strength this quarter either by customer or product? And then I think you said you were seeing some delayed awards. Is that the comment, sort of the protest that you mentioned or is that kind of a broader statement about the market? Anything you can elaborate on there.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, sure. So, our growth in the quarter with shield across many of our 7,000 contracts, but notably proportionately a bit more from our new contract awards. So, contract awards for new work, I think which is significant, we have seen a delay in contract awards from two fundamental factors. One, there has been an increase and elongation in the customer decision cycle; and two, we've seen an increase propensity of many in the IT industry to protest repeatedly. Early and often seems to be the mantra. So, both of those have increased our expectations for when we can see that growth coming, but I think I mentioned that we've got about $34 billion already in customer hands awaiting some sort of decision and we've got about $20 billion in the pipeline. So, all of that drives growth. It's just given this elongated cycle and given this increased propensity to protest, it's going to make the recognition of that revenue a little bit lumpier.
Matt Akers: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Phebe, just maybe one on shipbuilding. A little bit strategic, but one of your peers in shipbuilding stated that the future of the Navy is going to be Platform Plus, where shipbuilding platforms will be tailored around capabilities and technologies that are key differentiators. Would you agree with this? I'm not sure it applies to submarines as much surface ships, but would you agree with this and would GD need to make any additional investments either organically or inorganically to position yourself from this?
Phebe Novakovic: Platform Plus. I'm not sure I can give you any real insightful color around that. I will tell you how we see our ships. Let's talk about the surface combatants first in the DDG . That is an extraordinarily versatile ship that has over the years had multiple instantiation of improvements and remains a very, very agile ship in terms of its ability to upgrade. So, we're already on the block. Our fight free upgrade which gave an additional capability, I suspect that that ship and others like it can be the type of platform that evolves over time to address different kinds of missions. I think that that's pretty much regular order. I don't know that that's a systemic change in the way the Navy has ever looked at it's combatant fleet. With respect to our auxiliary ships, I think that those tend to be , and I'm thinking the oilers, EPS, those tend to be purpose-built ships for a particular mission. And then submarines, submarines remain a pivotal competitive advantage for the United States and what we have historically focused on and will continue to focus on is integrating any new technologies or capabilities up that's submarine. I think it's very important when you're in a complex business like shipbuilding and particularly submarine design and construction, that you focus on the business of designing and building those ship and ensuring that you can successfully integrate any new capabilities that your customer wants, and we have a long history of that and I suspect us to continue that for some time to come.
Howard Rubel: Raquel , we'll just take one more call, please.
Operator: Yes, sir. And our final question today will come from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please, go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So GDIT, when do you expect those two protests to be kind of adjudicated? And secondly, you have an above-average exposure to fed civil, which where the funding is strong, Q3 normally is the strongest booking quarter for the sector's book-to-bill quarter. So, give us some color on what we should expect this quarter to the extent?
Phebe Novakovic: So, Cai, you got a glass to judge . We have very little insight, like none into the timing of protest resolution. That really is up to the reviewing authority. With respective to the federal civilian, I think we've been with many of those customers for 30 years and we have a lot of customer intimacy across several many key federal civilian agencies. And I would imagine that as they receive more funding and the ubiquitousness of IT infrastructure to all of their missions, I would see that is some additional upside and potential for us. When that comes, again, we'll depend on whole series of issues around timing. But you can rest assure that in that pipeline on a going forward basis that we're looking at, we've got some good work in there.
Cai von Rumohr: Great. And so a follow-up on the AJAX; you mentioned you're .
Phebe Novakovic: So far we've had -- I think we had two issues .
Cai von Rumohr: Okay, two issues. Good point. But I believe it's a fixed price contract and there has been call there that basically you pay for all the state-issue expenses. Do you see that jeopardizing profitability on the contract?
Phebe Novakovic: We have been able to make any changes here before in a very cost-effective and time-efficient manner to meet the needs of our customers for the testing program. But I do not see at the moment any impact on our EACs, or frankly on our ability to produce this vehicle efficiently. The kinds of changes we're likely to see that we anticipate, typically are cut into the production line. So, I don't see a whole lot of motivations  from a cost or schedule impact from the changes that we can envision resulting from this -- from the resolution that we come to our customer with on these particular issues.
Cai von Rumohr: Terrific, thanks so much.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone, and welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter 2021 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.48 per diluted share on revenue of $9.4 billion, operating earnings of $938 million and net income of $708 million. Revenue is up $640 million or 7.3% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $4 million and net earnings are up $2 million. To be a little more granular, revenue on the Defense side of the business is up against last year's first quarter by $444 million and Aerospace is up $196 million. The operating earnings on the Defense side are up $45 million or 6.4%, while operating earnings in the Aerospace side are down $20 million, but still nicely above consensus. I'll have more to say about this A bit later. The operating margin for the entire company was 10%, 70 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was driven by a 250 basis point lower margin rated Aerospace, as was fully anticipated in our guidance to you, combined with $21 million more in corporate operating expense. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.18 per share. We have roughly $500 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and have 50 more operating earnings. So, it's a pure operations beat. I must confess that we were also beat our own expectations rather handsomely. This is in almost all respects a very solid quarter. It's hard to find something not to like about it. It's a very good start to the year. So, let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason at color around cash, backlog, taxes, and deployment of cash. And then we'll answer your questions. First, Aerospace. Aerospace enjoyed revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $220 million, with an 11.7% operating margin. Revenue is almost $200 million higher than anticipated by us and the sell side. Revenue is also $196 million higher than the year ago quarter. The difference is almost exclusively more G500 and G600 deliveries than the year ago quarter. The 11.7% operating margin is lower than the year ago quarter, but consistent with our guidance and sell side expectations. Finally, we took some mark-to-market charges with respect to our G500 test inventories. Without the charge from a pure operating perspective, performance in the quarter was superb. Aerospace also had a very strong quarter from an orders perspective with the book-to-bill of 1.3 to one. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.34 to one. In unit terms, this is the strongest order quarter for the last two years, excluding the fourth quarter of 2019 when we launched the G700.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we essentially broke even for the quarter. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was negative $131 million. For those of you who followed us for some time, you know we've been a fairly significant user of cash in the first quarter for the past several years. This quarter was a marked improvement from that pattern due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international Combat Systems program, consistent with the contract amendment Phebe referenced earlier. So, the quarter was nicely ahead of our expectations and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. Looking at capital deployment. I mentioned capital expenditures, which were $134 million in the quarter or 1.4% of sales. That's down between 25% and 30% from the first quarter a year ago, but we're still expecting full year CapEx to be roughly 2.5% of sales. We also paid $315 million in dividends and increase the quarterly dividend by a little more than 8% to $1.19 per share. And we spent nearly $750 million on the repurchase of 4.6 million shares at an average price of just over $161 per share. After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $11.4 billion, down $1.3 billion from this time last year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $123 million, up from $107 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in 2021 is due to the incremental debt issued last year in conjunction with the refinancing of maturing notes. We have $3 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we plan to refinance a portion of those notes to achieve a more balanced deployment of capital. But this will still result in a declining debt balance this year and beyond. During the quarter, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act. As you may be aware, it contains two provisions that affect our business. First, it extended the provision of the CARES Act that allows reimbursement of contractor payments to workers who were prevented from working due to COVID-related facility closures. This will continue to benefit our technologies business, although it does not provide for fee on those costs. So that will have an ongoing diluted impact on the segments margins.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Jason. As a reminder, we asked participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question today comes from Jon Raviv from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Raviv: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks. Thanks for the opportunity to hear. Question on actually on GDIT. The staffing , you guys had talked about 7% growth this year. You did 5% of the first quarter, so definitely a good start. So, any kind of milestones to look upon there. And then just overall commentary on the environment. We've heard of some delays and slowness in awards. Some other contractors have been highlighting, some disruptions that impact the organic growth. So, any view as to how that's impacting your 2021 and how that could flow out over 2022, some of these new businesses -- using awards come through.
Phebe Novakovic: So, as I noted, we submitted a very large number of proposals in the quarter, and we are waiting over $30 billion in customer’s decisions on contracts. And COVID, obviously, had some impact on those -- that decision-making process. But we suspect that as -- we expect that as the government gets back to full operating cadence that we will begin to work through some of that backlog on the order decisions.
Jonathan Raviv: And then as -- thank you, Phebe. As a brief follow-up, again, sticking to the technology and maybe also like key market. When you look at this huge -- almost backlog of things to be adjudicate, you mentioned that a lot of it is new business. Would you consider a lot of this new business to be takeaways from other contractors, or is this some that element of whites-pace almost with the government creating and doing more things that are contractor addressable?
Phebe Novakovic: So, I think, it's a combination. I think, we're winning more than our fair share, number one. Number two, the government is combining a number of preexisting current workload in the larger contracts given that the scale and magnitude of the effort that's required again is a good thing for us to bid on those large contracts. And then, some of it is just pure program programming. So, I think that's pretty much how we see that market unfolding.
Jonathan Raviv: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Seth.
Seth Seifman: I was wondering if you could -- I think you mentioned some inventory right downs on G500, I was wondering if you could quantify that. Just so we could have a cleaner look at the Aerospace margin.
Phebe Novakovic: Yeah. So, we're not in the habit of giving detailed product by product margin. We did have a mark-to-market on some of our test airplanes, on the 500 test airplanes, which is pretty much to be expected with test airplanes. But we see that as largely behind us. So, I noted that just to tell -- to give you awesome color that absent that we would have seen even better operating performance.
Seth Seifman: Right. I guess maybe without quantifying it, is there -- is it possible to talk a little bit about the -- I guess the trajectory of margins at Aerospace, when we should expect through the year and sort of as we go into Q2?
Phebe Novakovic: So, we expect, as I noted, deliveries to be lower in Q2, margins to be compressed in Q2, but increasing nicely then quarter-over-quarter, as we go through Q3 and into Q4. But recall, we admitted before that we see 2021 as our lower margin year for all the reasons that we noted, not the least of which is we took about 10 airplanes, largely as -- on our production last year largely as a result of the -- ended the 550 production and some mid-cabin. So, when the demand begins to increase or increasingly picks up and we ought to see some return to what we had considered our normal production rate and hence delivery rate. So, that'll drive margin.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: By the way, when you think about margin, particularly out the impact of the entry into service of the 700.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. Good quarter, Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Cai.
Cai von Rumohr: So, could you give us some more on demand at Gulfstream? You basically said it's broadly based. But first, what are we looking at in terms of corporate demand, which we've heard is still weak and ultra high net worth, which we've heard is very strong. And any color on specific models. Like I think you said you had 70 orders for the G700, are those -- is that number moving up at a decent pace?
Phebe Novakovic:
indoor 22:46: So, look, if you think about demand, as we see the lifting of the international travel restrictions and removal of quarantine restrictions and the increased confidence of obviously the U.S. economy, but also global economies, we expect to see demand continue to increase and should it, we see Gulfstream as being in very good stead.
Cai von Rumohr: So, you mentioned demand getting better. And we know that pre-owned prices are continuing to come down and we have the weird situation where all of this happening, while international routes are not opening up. Given the strength in demand, if you wanted, or if the demand were there to sort of deliver more planes, how long would it take you to kind of uptick your production rate so that we can see those deliveries moving up?
Phebe Novakovic: So, on average, it takes about six months lead time. But we're -- looking at just a few more production airplanes, as I noted in my remarks, and we'll continue to adjust and be sufficiently agile as we see demand continue to increase. So I liked how we balanced ourselves right now. Prudent, yet forward looking and we are pretty efficient when it comes to that to ramping up. But it does take the lead time of about two quarters.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning, David.
David Strauss: Phebe, want to follow-up on some of your earlier comments around the margin in Gulfstream. So, over time we got used to this being a mid to high teens business. Is that still the right way to think about this business going forward, particularly when the 700 comes in? And do you expect the 700 to be margin accretive when it starts to deliver?
Phebe Novakovic: So, the 700 will be margin accretive when we begin deliveries. We think about this on -- given our portfolio and our place in the firmament as a mid-teen margin business for the short-term. But as you can imagine, we'll continue to work margins. And as we've talked about many times before our margins at Gulfstream are a whole host -- driven by a whole host of issues, not the least of which is service mix, mix of airplanes. And when we were -- a couple of years ago, that was, as you recall, an acceleration of the 650 backlog, which kind of solitary effect of better aligning 650 demand with the backlog. So, there wasn't too much of wait for people. But also helping us transition through that period when we were replacing the 450, 500 -- the 450, 550 with 500 and 600. So that is largely behind us. And we -- as I said, expect to see some nice margin accretion as we go forward.
David Strauss: Great. That's helpful. And do you think -- could you comment a little bit on the moving pieces of capital and what to expect there? Inventories come down a bit, advances, benefit of headwind. So, just -- how we should expect the different pieces within working capital to move from here? Thanks.
Jason Aiken: Sure. You'll recall the major moving pieces that we've talked about, sort of outside the normal run rates for the business, in general, have been the elevated inventory level at Gulfstream as we have invested in the new models between test airplanes and the buildup for production and entry into service. That obviously has been a headwind for several years now. We saw that start to turn at the end of last year, a little bit better than we thought was going to happen, a little earlier than we thought was going to happen. And so we -- that helped us outperform our cash flow expectations for 2020. You can think about that for Gulfstream continuing to normalize this year. We'll start to see the 500s and 600s hit that inflection point and no longer be a headwind. But at the same time, keep in mind, we're building up on the 700 as that program moves toward entry into service. So, that'll become a little more neutral this year and then eventually shifted into a tailwind in the 2022 period and beyond. The other piece is, obviously, the large international program at Combat Systems, which again was a headwind for several years, that turned with the modification to that contract that Phebe discussed earlier into a more neutral event last year. So that stabilized last year and becomes a very modest tailwind this year, and then becomes a more meaningful tailwind in 2022, 2023, and a little bit more in 2024. So, when you think about the way those two pieces are moving, that kind of gets us on a cash flow trajectory from -- if you go back to 2019, we were in the 60%-ish range moving toward an expectation of the 80% range. Last year, we outperformed that a little bit as Gulfstream did a little better. And now we're in the high -- mid to high 90% range. The one piece there that's still sort of keeping us out of the 100% range really is the elevated investment profile in CapEx at Marine Systems. So, once that normalizes, next year, it gets back into the 2% of sales range. You should expect to see us the whole business at large being in the 100% to 100%-plus range, really with those two working capital pieces at Gulfstream and Combat Systems becoming the tailwinds that allow us to get even nicely above a 100%. So, that's kind of the trajectory for all those major moving pieces. Hopefully that gives you a sense of where we're going and the basis for our expectation for the improvement that we see ahead.
David Strauss: Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Ronald Epstein: Yeah. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning, Ron.
Ronald Epstein: How are you? Switching over to the ship business? How is the electric boat adjusting to both having the Virginia Class and the Columbia Class in -- everything that they got to do in terms of workforce, supply chain, so on and so forth, and how's that going?
Phebe Novakovic: It's going very well, on both ramping up Virginia and equally importantly, more significantly Columbia. There's something important to remember when you think about Columbia. We started work on that program 14 years ago. And in that 14-year-period we have worked assiduously with the Navy to reduce all known potential risks that we could foresee in the ramp up of a very complex new program that -- and that included workforce hiring and training, supply chain readiness, facility readiness, construction prototyping, technology readiness, retiring potential known risks -- the potential risks in new high-end technologies and then the design maturity. That -- this boat entered into construction with a 83% design completion level and break contest to Virginia, which has been an exemplary program at 43%. So all of this prior planning and 14 years of detailed blocking and tackling at every conceivable level has mitigated an awful lot of risk and allowed us to -- for verbally hit the ground running on Columbia, and so far so good. I will know, it’s a very complex program, so you can't declare victory on any ship building program right out of the bat, but we have taken unprecedented and historically unprecedented measures to retire all the known risks going forward. So that has really allowed us to execute coming right out of the gates very strongly. They've done a very good job.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. Got it. Got it. And it seems like the focus on the Pacific's been good for the ship business. How's it been for Gulfstream? I mean, when you think about U.S., China relations, has that had an impact on Gulfstream demand in the region?
Phebe Novakovic: Not that we can see. So, our demand in Asia has been quite steady and good. We've got nice, large install base, a lot of customer intimacy there. So, today we have not seen it, that particular impact.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning, Myles.
Myles Walton: Heard your thoughts on M&A for a little bit, so I was hoping maybe we could go there. Obviously, you're getting to a point on your leverage, which is getting pretty attractive, building up plenty of firepower. What are you looking at in terms of landscape GDs, always historically been an acquisitive company. Is the appetite growing there?
Phebe Novakovic: So, we have been through a significant investment period across many of our large lines of business and our focus here is on execution and primary focus. We will -- we always look for potential niche bolt-ons here and there. But we don't see anything on the horizon here of any significant opportunities that would entice us.
Myles Walton: Okay. And Jason, what's the target ratios that we're aiming for? I know you said you'll refinance some of it, but maybe a little color there.
Jason Aiken: Yeah. I think perhaps less of a target ratio then -- we're going to continue to prioritize our mid A rating. That's always going to be sort of where we seek to land long-term. And so, the key for us right now is we had -- as you're aware of sort of an outsize level of debt maturing this year versus if you look out over the next 10 to 20 years what our debt ladder maturity phasing looks like. And so, really what we're aiming to do is sort of bring that into more of a balanced picture of capital deployment that allows us to step down the debt over time in reasonable measures, as well as have considerable flexibility and firepower available for other deployment opportunities. 
Myles Walton: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, everyone. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Sheila.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Hey. Phebe, maybe a big picture question for you, because I know Howard always has us covered on the numbers. You've been at GD as the -- over almost a decade now and at the company for 20 years, how do you think about where GD goes over the next decade, whether from a portfolio focus or customer focus as the budget flat lines or where operating leverage comes from that?
Phebe Novakovic: So, from a strategic perspective, we decided several years ago to invest in a number of our significant lines of business, where we believe that we could realize the best return on invested capital and really drive value. We have been in that period at Gulfstream, GDIT, primarily the Gulfstream, GDIT and the Marine Group. So the key now from my perspective is all about execution. And execution has been the hallmark of everything that we do here, and it is the undergirding of all financial performance. And it requires a discipline across -- it requires discipline across a series of elements and that are faster than all operations. But really, as I see the next several years, it's all about execution and wise deployment of capital to drive nice value creation. Ultimately, long-term value creation is based on good product. It's a perm execution wise investments and smart capital limit. So that's what I see us doing.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Please go ahead with your question.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, Phebe and Jason and Howard.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Pete Skibitski: Phebe, I was wondering -- in Combat, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what international orders are out there for you, maybe both kind of sole source expectations as well as competitive opportunities.
Phebe Novakovic: So, international consists of two items, primarily sales outside the United States from entities outside -- from our business units outside the United States, as well as FMS sales emanating from the United States. And unfortunately, for the state of humankind, the world has become an increasingly dangerous place. And so, we see the reflection of that concern in many of U.S. allies with increased demand for many of our products in Europe, Eastern Europe, a little bit in Asia, parts of the Middle East, and in the former Commonwealth nations and in the U.K. as well. So, we looked for nice, steady demand signals coming from outside the United States for our business units that are domiciled ex-U.S. And FMS, United States has had a long history of providing its allies with FMS opportunities. And we have a number of those in our comp opportunities and our Combat Systems again, selling through the U.S. government to key us allies positions in particularly dangerous. So, we see that nice cadence continuing in terms of our orders.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. And U.S. wise, you expect programs that you're competing for this MPS and all MSP. Do you think they survive any budget tightness?
Phebe Novakovic: So, new programs are always the most vulnerable. But with MPS, we were -- the only person -- they're only contracted to develop -- I think there were 12 prototypes. We delivered those last year. We liked our offering. We think it's what the army wants. But we are very attuned to army demands and how they see their site. And that's where -- intimacy with the army helps significantly. That plus -- so with all of them at MSP, that program got stretched considerably. So, we are taking it seriously and participating, but there's a long way to go before that comes to fruition. But recall another element and a key element of army modernization is upgrading with key -- with important and innovative new technologies, their existing platforms. And for us that means Stryker and Abrams, and both are undergoing major upgrade programs. So, all-in-all, we see the demand for our programs continuing to go strong. And there is nothing like -- going back to the earlier comments about execution. There's nothing like performing on schedule and on budget to amplify and provide a bit of an antidote to any potential cuts that come in the future. So, Combat is the army's major integrator of Combat Wheeled Systems and will remain such. So that ensures that our place in the firmament remains pretty strong.
Pete Skibitski: Right. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Peter Arment: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Phebe, Jason. Phebe, a question on the budgets, I guess just kind of following up on your comments there. Just -- we got the skinny budget from the new administration, and obviously we're to get some -- a lot more details soon. But how are you thinking about just the alignment with the new administration priorities when you think it look at GDs portfolio? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So, clearly, as I think -- perhaps it was Ron mentioned the demand for products that meet the pacific theater have -- has increased that puts our ship building business, particularly submarines in a very good stead. And you can see all of -- both the rhetoric of funding supporting increased submarine production. And we are executing on the current programs of record and working with the Navy to -- additional submarines can be executed in a relatively short-term. With respect to our Combat Systems Group, unfortunately, but regrettably the case, the hottest theater at the moment is Russia. And so whether we like it or not, that is the reality with which we were faced and this administration has been very quick to respond appropriately to the Russians. And so you see -- we believe that Combat System is highly aligned with that reality that we're now faced with in Europe. So, all-in-all, we liked our positioning with the new administration's priority. Remember, and particularly administration and this president has been an advocate of strong national security throughout his long and distinguished career. U.S. National Security strategy is driven by the threat of the perception of threat that has not changed. So, we will see some changes in relative priority among systems, but in all instances, we see ourselves very well aligned.
Peter Arment: And just as a quick follow-up. Something that doesn't get talked a lot about, but you have a lot of CyOps  capabilities. Maybe you could just give us a little color on how you see the opportunities there. Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So, if you mean from both cyber, cyber is embedded in all of our business and if you get to -- but I think you referred to CyOps. One would be -- it would be the height of fallen to discuss any of that. But let's just put it this way. We have always been on the leading edge of innovations with respect to cyber and electronic technologies that apply to the real world site in the moment.
Peter Arment: Appreciate all the color. Thanks, Phebe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Safran from Seaport Global. Please go ahead with your question.
Richard Safran: Phebe, Jason, Howard, good morning. How are you?
Phebe Novakovic: Fine.
Richard Safran: First question I had is, I was interested in the announcement and I think it was back in February where at IT you added Amazon cloud services to the milCloud 2.0. What I wanted to know is, how much does the addition of Amazon enhance your offering? Was this something that just improve the cost on the program, or is this something that maybe opens up new opportunities for expanding cloud service to the government? Just anything you can tell us regarding the size of the opportunity, or what this does, would be appreciated.
Phebe Novakovic: So, not surprisingly, the U.S. Department of Defense is moving as all major institutions are increasingly to the cloud. And so, our cloud offerings are -- an incrementally important part of our offerings that we believe will ultimately drive increased adoption across our existing contracts and adoption of the technology suite that we offer. And frankly, an expansion of the market. So, cloud presents a significant opportunity, and we are well-positioned to execute on it.
Richard Safran: Okay. Thanks for that. And then second -- and just to kind of a broad strategic question for you and your comments about execution. Over the past year or so, you've made a number of changes to adjust how you're operating, clearly for obvious reasons. I was just wondering, what are the more permanent changes and how you operate -- and that are going to persist long after COVID? I was just wondering if you discuss how these changes? How you're thinking about that impacting and improving margins.
Phebe Novakovic: So, let me infer a little bit from the question you're asking. We hear a lot of anecdotal evidence that there may be systemic changes emanating from COVID that have to do with work-at-home and what that might mean for a commercial real estate footprint. We still believe it is too soon to declare any change structural. We do expect to see some -- the extent to which remains to be seen, but some work-from-home either in hybrid capacities, or in some cases more completely.  But I don't see that move as something that is dispositive and determinative of real performance and execution. I think what you saw -- going back to execution through COVID -- and frankly, this company's performance across its business units during COVID was really a manifestation of the discipline that we have in all of our operating -- and our operating performance and our operating leverage. The more disciplined a company is the better they were able to adapt to the vagaries and some of the really significant challenges that COVID provided both to the workforce and frankly, the costumers and the environment. So, I think that, to me, it underscored, amplified our operating excellence. And I suspect that that will continue -- then understanding of that will continue to permeate as we go forward. And we will continue to build on that. Operating excellence is never static. It has to get better and better and better. That's what continuous improvement is all about. And frankly, we have a longstanding discipline of around that. So, I don't think there'll be a structural change in our operating performance, but it's simply undergirds the importance of that discipline that focuses on performance.
Richard Safran: Excellent color. Thanks.
Howard Rubel: And Jamie, we will have time for just one last question, please.
Operator: And our final question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Robert Stallard: Thanks very much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Morning. 
Robert Stallard: Phebe, just a couple of quick ones on the Aerospace division. Clearly, a very strong first quarter here. But I was wondering if you had seen any demand pulled forwards into the first quarter from the second quarter. And then secondly, you talked this before. How is the lead time for aircraft looking at? Are we still looking at roughly 12 months between an order and a delivery? And also how has pricing fed in the first quarter? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: So, think of that demand, less about pull forward, demand comes when it comes and you execute it as it arrives on your doorstep. So, what we saw with respect to demand is starting -- as I noted in mid February, we start -- and we saw a nice steady increase in demand across a broad specter of our customer base and the U.S. Our initial estimates show or indications are that that demand is carrying through into the second quarter. Pricing is holding up very well. As you all know, we are very disciplined about our pricing. It is precious once lost. You don’t get it back. We’ve had a hard slog. So, pricing has done very well. And as I noted earlier, it’s about six months to ramp up additional production and I don’t see that interim significantly changing anytime soon, given all of the elements that have to perform. So, I hope that answers your question.
Robert Stallard: Yeah. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Howard Rubel: Operator, this now ends our call. Thank you very much everybody for your time. And I will be available to answer your questions, and I can be reached in my office. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  Please also, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full-year 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning. Thank you, Howard. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, net earnings of $1 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.49. This is, in most respects, a very solid quarter, even though we missed consensus by $0.05. I have more to say about that shortly. Despite the adverse impact of the pandemic, we achieved most of our operational and financial goals added dramatically to our backlog and had a very good cash quarter. The results in comparisons with prior periods are rather straightforward and set out in our press release. Because of the adverse impact to the economy caused by COVID-19, I'll devote less time to the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and spend more time on the sequential improvement that tells a compelling story of recovery. I'll go through that in some detail as I give you my thoughts on the business segments. As we indicated that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest, it is quite remarkable that we came within $0.02 of the very strong pre-pandemic fourth quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that revenue is up 11.1%, operating earnings are up 20.6%, net earnings are up 20.1% and earnings per share are up 20.3%. So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance even compared to the year-ago quarter, but really good sequentially. For the full year, we had revenue of $37.9 billion, down from 3.6% from the prior year, net earnings of $3.17 billion and earnings diluted shares of $11, once again modestly below consensus. Our business was strengthened by significant growth in the backlog to a year-end record high of $89.5 billion. The same is true of total estimated contract value at $134.7 billion. The total company book-to-bill was 1.1:1 for the year, led by the particularly strong order performance of Electric Boat. The strong order intake across the Board positions the Company well for 2021 and beyond. Our cash performance for the quarter and the year was stronger than expected with a conversion rate of 91% of net income for the year. Jason will have more fulsome comments on this subject in his remarks.  Let me review the quarter, paying particular attention to sequential comparisons and the full year in the context of each group and provide some color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.4 billion is up 23.3% over the third quarter on the strength of the delivery of 40 aircraft, 34 of which were large cabin. While this was the strongest delivery quarter of the year, it fell short of our expectations by three aircraft, two of which delivered after the first of the year, for reasons related to customer preference. The third aircraft had a willing customer, but it was not ready for delivery by year end, that one's on us.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated just over $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, approximately 220% of net income. That resulted in free cash flow for the year of $2.9 billion, a cash conversion rate of 91%, nicely ahead of our anticipated 80% to 85% of net income. To put this in context, our cash from operations for the year of $3.9 billion was less than $20 million shy of the highest annual operating cash flow we've ever had, notwithstanding the impact of COVID on our operations in 2020. In fact, our free cash performance for the year was just short of achieving our original pre-COVID cash forecast, so really a remarkable outcome. This was the result of outstanding performance across the business to close out the year, most notably in the Aerospace group, which began to draw down its inventory that we've been discussing for some time. And the Technologies group, which continues to generate superb cash flows, as Phebe mentioned, in this case, in excess of 150% of imputed net income for the year. And as you'll recall, at this time last year, we negotiated a path forward on our large international contract in Combat Systems, including a revised progress payment schedule that liquidates their receivables balance over the next three years. As part of that agreement, we received two payments of $500 million each last year and we received the next progress payment earlier this month in accordance with the revised schedule. So that OWC will continue to unwind as we've discussed on past calls. Of course, Marine Systems continues with its significant facilities improvements in support of the unprecedented growth on the horizon. To that point, we had capital expenditures of $345 million in the fourth quarter for a full year total of nearly $1 billion or 2.5% of sales. You may recall, we had expected our CapEx to peak in 2020 at roughly 3% of sales due to these shipyard investments. As you might expect, given the impact of the pandemic, we've managed the timing of this CapEx spend prudently, and the result is three years, '19, '20 and '21, at roughly 2.5% of sales. This timing fully supports our Columbia and Block V build plant at Electric Boat. We then expect to trend back down and return to the more typical 2% range by 2023, consistent with our previous expectations.
Phebe Novakovic: With that, I'll turn to our expectations for 2021. So let me provide our operating forecast initially by business group and then on a company-wide rollout. In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be about $8 billion, essentially flat with 2020. Operating margins will be about 12.5%, leading to operating earnings of $1 billion, maybe slightly more. So what is driving this forecast, and in particular, the lower margins in 2021 when revenue is similar to 2020? You will recall that I told you last quarter, we will deliver 13 fewer G550 as that airplane is no longer in production. This leaves us with 13 fewer aircraft, not including the three slips from 2020. So all up, 10 fewer aircraft, this reduction in revenue will be made up by a roughly $500 million increase in services across Jet Aviation and Gulfstream at about 10% lower operating margin. There are a lot of other puts and takes, but this gives you the big picture for the lower anticipated margins. By the way, our forecasted production delivery considers our backlog, our fourth quarter orders and our take on current demand. I fully expect 2022 will have better revenue and earnings, stimulated by the entry into service the G700 in the fourth quarter and improving demand across the product lines as the economy recovers. In Combat Systems, we expect revenue of about $7.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million over 2020. We expect the operating margin to be about 14.5% and operating earnings to exceed last year by $20 million or 2%. We look for revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. After several years of good revenue growth, 2021 and 2022 will have modest growth. Growth should resume in 2023 and beyond as several developmental programs move into production. The Marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately $10.3 billion, an increase of over $300 million. Operating margin in 2021 is anticipated to be around 8.3%, driven in large part by increased work on the first two cost-plus Columbia submarines, which have conservative initial booking rates. We anticipate growth at each of the yards. The long-term driver of growth here is the submarine work, which will expand significantly. Our biggest upside opportunity in this group is to outperform the forecasted revenue line. We expect revenue in the Technologies group of $13.2 billion, $580 million more than 2020. This is a growth of 4.5% with GDIT growing at a rate of 7.1%. Mission Systems will be essentially flat with organic growth of 3%, offset by the SATCOM divestiture. We expect earnings of $1.25 billion, about $50 million more than 2020. This implies an overall margin of 9.5% with GDIT returning to 7% or more. So for 2021, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $39 billion of revenue, up over $1 billion from 2020 and operating margin at 10.5%. This all rolls up to a forecast range of $11 to $11.05 per fully diluted share basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it has in prior years with Q1 about $2.20 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 16% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperformed many operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. I should leave you with this one final thought. Our strong cash flow in anticipation of a 95% to 100% conversion rate in 2021, leaves us with the ability to engage in a share repurchase program this year to enhance the EPS figures I have just given you. We will see how that plays out. I'll be more specific about this after the end of the first quarter. Back to you, Howard.
Howard Rubel: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask each participant one question and one follow-up question so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Absolutely.  today's first question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: Phebe, if you could just sort of talk -- I know you mentioned that you want to have this for the end of the first quarter, but you're starting a repo again in 4Q, looking at a much better conversion rate this year. Just sort of big picture on where free cash flow conversion goes this year and ahead, especially if you see a big recovery, a bigger recovery in 2022 and then kind of what the levers are for capital allocation as the year progresses with those debt repayments, but also saying that you might have some excess as well?
Phebe Novakovic: Let me ask Jason to give you a little specificity there.
Jason Aiken: Yes. So John, I think at a macro level, the best way to think about this is we have to think about this is we have every expectation that we will see year-over-year increases in our free cash flow. As you saw, we had a nice outperformance of our expectation in the fourth quarter to wrap up a pretty strong 2020. That set us off on this course a little quicker than we expected. A lot of that was Gulfstream doing a great job getting some of that inventory to start to turn, and so working some of that operating working capital. As Phebe alluded to, GDIT also had an outstanding performance in the fourth quarter. I think we expect to see those trends really continue. I mean, basically, the core fundamental underlying performance of each of the businesses, but then buoy by the further improvement in OWC. The one we talked about or I alluded to briefly on the call is the continued unwinding of the unbilled receivables balance in Combat Systems. I mentioned we did receive the third major progress payment here earlier this month of January. That's encouraging to see that that program continues at pace. And so between that program unwinding, the working down of the working capital over the next couple of years at Gulfstream and of course, the winding down of the CapEx at Marine Systems, we expect to see that year-on-year growth in free cash flow, obviously, to support further capital deployment, at which I'll turn back over to Phebe to address.
Phebe Novakovic: So look, we've been real clear over the years that we invest in our business depending on the need and the expected return on that invested capital. The one element of capital deployment that should be repeatable, achievable, each and every -- and sustainable each and every year are dividends. We'll be discussing that with our Board. Obviously, debt repayment and then share repurchase. And let me just leave it at that. We have more work to do with our Board. But you can expect us to be good stewards of capital.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: I asked this question a little sheepishly, but I wanted to go back to something you said about Aerospace. And you said, if you've been following our R&D spending, you know there's more to come on this subject. I like to think that I'm following it, but maybe if you could speak to that in a little more detail and what that means?
Phebe Novakovic: So as you and I agree that I gave you as much detail as I intend to here. So why don't we find another question to discuss together?
Seth Seifman: Okay, maybe on the cash flow then. Jason, it looks like we're moving from 2 9 in 2020 to maybe about 3 1 in 2021. Can you talk about the key moving pieces there, especially working capital and they ended the year with a very low receivables balance, and sort of, is working capital overall going to be a contributor and so to the extent it can continue to decline?
Jason Aiken: Yes. I think to cut to the chase. I think you put your finger on it. It is the continued working of that OWC. It's partially receivables, you saw some good movement there in the fourth quarter of last year, but that should continue as well as the inventory side of things. We'll get to unloading these test articles, a Gulfstream over the balance of this year and into early next year. So that will be a big help as well. And that will continue in terms of the OWC turn, not just through the balance of this year, but it will be a big mover in 2022 and 2023 as well.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. So Phebe, you mentioned Q4 initial deliveries of the G700. I think at one point, it looked like G700 was going to be early in the year. I know a lot has happened obviously with MAX and COVID. How confident are you that you can really hit that delivery bogey? And what does that assume in terms of certification?
Phebe Novakovic: So Cai, I think if we go back and look at the record, we've been pretty consistent that it would be toward the end of 2022. And the test program, all the test points, the expectation of the airplane throughout its test program has met all of our design specification. So the program is going very, very well. And we will work with the FAA on certification prior to the entry into service. But the progress of the test program supports end of year 2022.
Cai von Rumohr: What I mean you said you're going to expect an up year in '22. How many G700s? What if the G700 slips into '23, is it an up year or a down year?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, look, our expectations are predicated on a recovery in the market that will drive fundamentally all of Gulfstream's performance. But we're pretty much counting on the 700. And if it is, it would be by a quarter or so, but I don't believe that that's the case at the moment. And so what we do is in work with our FAA teammate and made the best estimates that we can for one, we believe this is going to enter into service. We're not going to get into the number of production and deliveries by model we never have or not going to. But that airplane is coming, and it comes with nice margin performance and good cash. So our expectation, I think, is reasonable given all the fat patterns we have an evidence at the moment. And if it changes, of course, we'll let you know, but we have nothing to believe at the moment that it will change.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Phebe, you mentioned that there's been some commentary around the G650 and the market demand for this aircraft. I was wondering if you could give us some idea of what the sort of slot availability is for this plane, looking out over the next 12 months or two years? And whether you're seeing any sign of the G700 cannibalizing the market?
Phebe Novakovic: So the 650, as I've noted, continued to be in demand. It is a powerful airplane. There's nothing close to it in its market. We are not going to get into open slots. We've never really done that with any specificity, and we're not going to start now. Just suffice it to say, we don't build strings and white tails. But look, we've talked about this a couple of times and just to refresh, the 700 and the 650 have materially different missions and there are at different price points and the customers well understand the distinction. And I think the parable to think about to amplify that point is that when we announced the 700, 650 demand increased because of the clarity provided in that market space. So that was a -- it was additive, not subtractive. So we believe that, that pattern will continue given the differentiation between the two airplanes. Does that help you?
Robert Stallard: Yes. And just as a follow-up. On the G650, you did bring the rate down there modestly. Do you see that now as a sustainable rate over the next few years? Or could it actually head higher again?
Phebe Novakovic: We are comfortable with the rate that we're looking at the moment. But look, you've seen us sufficiently agile to adjust on the up. I don't expect that at the moment. We still have very good demand. Our rate supports that demand and the demand supports that rate. And we anticipate a nice steady order book and production schedule for the time to come. So we're really pleased with that airplane.
Operator: And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Phebe, I just wanted to touch on Marine and the growth that you're forecasting there. I think you said there's potential upside, but looks like your forecast about 3% top line growth. I know it's on a tough comp. Can you just talk about where the potential upside could come from? How much Columbia is accounting for of that growth? And would you expect Marine's growth rate to reaccelerate once we get beyond 2021?
Phebe Novakovic: So, the growth is -- can be on any given year, a bit lumpy, but the trajectory is there, supported by that backlog. I think this year, in 2020, I think Colombia accounted for 50% of that growth. But the way to think about this in crudely approximately from a trajectory perspective is, we're looking between $400 million to $500 million of growth a year. And then that will continue to accelerate as we pull through more production. So in the moment for 2021, as I alluded to in my remarks, the opportunity there is for increased revenue. And that happens in these shipyards by increased throughput. We pull work in, depending on the work cadence, the schedule, the planning, the availability. So that is in the moment. If any upside comes to growth in 2021, it will be based on that. But you are quite right, we -- that comparison base is off for this year is very, very strong growth. But there's nothing to suggest that there's any particular issue here. It's simply just the timing and the mix.
David Strauss: Right, the $400 million to $500 million that you just referenced, is that the annual revenue increase that you're expecting out of Columbia per year for the next couple of years?
Phebe Novakovic: No, the whole group.
David Strauss: Okay, got it. And then on Combat, can you -- may be split it out kind of what you're seeing on the U.S. side versus Europe? And are you having any issues in Europe given some of the shutdowns that we've seen over there? 
Phebe Novakovic: Well, let's talk about the U.S. As we've talked about, we are the premier systems integrator for combat systems platforms in the United States. And all of our key franchise programs are in the process of modernization, upgrading, and we anticipate that to go forward. If you think about army modernization, it comes in two flavors. One is upgrading a critical or fighting vehicles and equipment to meet the modern battlefield. And if you think about that, the Stryker of today and the Abrams of today are in all respects different than their predecessors. They look the same, but in all other respects, these are increasingly lethal, increasingly capable, agile platforms. And that gives them relevance to the war fight today and the war fight envisioned in the joint forces combat scenarios of the U.S. military. So those modernization upgrades will continue.  And then the second category of army modernization is in their new start programs. And they've got a number of them as we look out into the horizon. Again, given our capability set, given our proven long-term delivery, we deliver things on time at cost. That puts us in very good stead, along with the Technologies investments we've been making over the last four, five, six years. We are producing some really powerful platforms that will be critical to the future fight. So, I feel good about that. On top of that, in the U.S., our ordinance and armaments business continues to grow. They are critical subcomponents, on almost every major weapons missile system in the U.S. So, these are very, very strong, high leverage, deep backlog, deep customer intimacy programs in the United States. When you look outside the United States, we are continuing to see growth. We've got the Ajax program that has just begun its testing. So, we've got quite a bit of ways to go there. And when you think about our European land system, just to give you a little perspective, there are over 7,000 in-service lab-type vehicles that come out of -- has come out of our European business. That installed base is enormous. And it's an enormous competitive advantage. Some of those systems are older and they need to be upgraded. And we continue to see demand out of multiple parts of Europe. So, we expect ELS to grow and the world hasn't got any safer and that reality of the threat environment drives the demand. So, I hope that gives you a little bit of color here.
Operator: And our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Phebe, I noticed when you call out 0.96 book-to-bill, that's a gross number. So, it looks like there were like $244 million of cancellations in the quarter, if you could specify what they actually were?
Phebe Novakovic: So, look, we still have a very low default rate that's really not meaningful either in the moment for us or going forward. So, we're not going to give you a model by model. I can tell you nothing particularly surprised us. And it signifies for us at the moment, really nothing on a going-forward basis. Does that help?
George Shapiro: Not as much as I'd like.
Phebe Novakovic: I'm sure. Do you think I want to start to  backlog. You .
George Shapiro: I can figure, but I figured I'd ask anyway. And then my other question is the sequential backlog at Technologies dropped like 6% and this sector continued to disappoint again in revenues, as you mentioned. So, what's really going on there? I mean, I mean we've seen this for quite a while at this time.
Phebe Novakovic: So, look we had anticipated going into 2020 that we would see the growth that we had expected. COVID derailed it back a bit. But as we do our planning and think through how we are going to manage COVID going forward and the advance of COVID, at some point in the year, we see that growth in supported by that backlog. And again, I think Jason gave you a very fulsome explanation of how we treat our backlog, and we do that differently than anybody else. And I think we sometimes get penalized for it, but we have the backlog to support growth that we are anticipating.
Jason Aiken: And George, just to add another fine point, and I alluded to this a little earlier, but I want to make sure it's clear. This business, in particular, I think, is the most relevant to pay attention to that total potential contract value versus the -- strictly the traditional firm-funded backlog. And the reason is, I think I mentioned this earlier, this business year in and year out, 50% or more, and in fact, I think in 2020 was 60% of their annual orders and revenue value, comes out of that bucket of value that we articulate as IDIQ/options potential contract value. So that's very different than the pure-play platform businesses that have the traditional contracting firm backlog and so on. And so, I don't think it can be overlooked and in fact, it should be emphasized and should be the focal point of analysis on where that value is coming from and to Phebe's point, what's supportive of our expectations of growth for that business. 
George Shapiro: But even Jason, on that basis, it was still down somewhat sequentially, if I looked at the total number that you gave.
Jason Aiken: So there's pieces of that, there's Mission Systems and GDIT in there. GDIT was actually up, I believe, in fact, I think in like 10% or 11%, between you and me. And again, to reiterate what I discussed earlier, when we get these large programs, think of DOs as an example, it's a potential $4.4 billion program, not even a small fraction of that went into even that IDIQ bucket. So major resolution of a significant headline award, so you're not yet seeing manifest in the backlog or even in the IDIQ bucket, but will over time support the fundamental underpinnings of the growth that we're alluding to, so a pretty conservative approach to it, but we think appropriate, and you'll see measured out over time as those programs progress.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Doug Harned at Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: In the GDIT emission systems, I mean, once upon a time they were together and you split them up, and now they're coming back again. Could you talk a little bit about the evolution of your thinking about these businesses? And I know earlier, you talked about these integrated systems where they can work together. And perhaps you could highlight some of the programs that of the programs that are opportunities for you in that kind of work?
Phebe Novakovic: So we have -- look, you would expect us to remain agile to changing trends in the marketplace. And what we were observing is that while our services business and even the older incarnation of Mission Systems work closely together across a number of programs. Increasingly, in the last three years, we're seeing more and more of that. They're working together on bids. They're submitting bids together. And that -- what I've liked about that, these are two separate businesses managed separately. They understand each other. The guys who at Mission Systems know how to run their product portfolio, and the guys at GDIT know how to manage their IT work together business in the last three years, we're are opportunities for you in are two separate businesses managed separately. They services business. And I think those areas of expertise, it's very important to keep them separate from a management point of view. To have them come together to work more seamlessly, we believe this reporting structure helped. But no other respects are we changing anything. So we have a -- Howard, can give you a pretty definitive list, but Jason could give you a few of just the indicative kinds of programs we're looking at.
Jason Aiken: Doug, it's going to come across if we get into this in too much detail sounding like a bunch of alphabet soup just based on the nature of these businesses. But suffice it to say, it is an increasing portfolio of opportunities where they're going to market together, including work on areas like supercomputing, which they're doing for NOAA, broader-based end-to-end enterprise network services, for example, like what they're working on for FAA, work on ground-based strategic deterrent, so on and so forth as well as a number of items for classified customers in FAA. They've got work for the Air Force. Again, the list could go on and on, if I name the programs, it wouldn't necessarily mean anything because they're all code names, but it is an increasing portfolio where they are getting pull-through overlap and commonality in these offerings.
Doug Harned: Okay. And then also one more thing that gets into the details here on programs. If we go back to combat, Phebe, you talked about the trajectory here and flattening period, probably growth in 2023, where do you see that growth coming from? You mentioned some things, but if you had to say, this is why I'm confident in 2023 growth, would it be from some specific U.S. programs? Would it be ELS? Could it be other international? What are the things that get you most confident on that longer-term trajectory?
Phebe Novakovic: So look, we've got -- I think, longer term, we're looking at additional Stryker configurations. If you think about the Stryker, it is a very versatile very versatile platform. And we've seen the Army in working with us, finding innovative and increasingly more fight critical variance of Stryker. So we have the SHORAD and like -- so we have the SHORAD system coming. We are looking at electronic warfare, medical. And there's a whole series of other increasingly, some of them sensitive, Stryker have -- their brigades have increased their numbers by about maybe 4%, 5%. So each brigade is going to get over time more Strykers in these various configurations. So that's important to that program. We also see the Abrams continuing its modernization. And then we believe we have additional out-year international opportunities, largely through FMS. So we see some growth in Canada, Morocco, Poland, Czech Republic. So all of that contributes -- that's all within the U.S. All of that contributes to our assumptions about growth in this portfolio. Outside the United States, I tried to give you some context about the large embedded fleet and the need to upgrade that fleet. And that, along with the Spanish program, we may see some additional vehicles under that Spanish program, it's soon to call that. So we are really assuming that. But those are the elements that we are -- and by the way, there are new programs, developmental programs that are out for competition, and we like where we stand in those. I will just say one thing about MPS. We developed all 12 prototypes for the testing and evaluation. And I believe we are the only ones to do so even within the COVID environment. That's a discipline will do for you, disciplined product excellence and manufacturing operating excellence. So that is the pipeline that we see in our future.
Howard Rubel: Operator, this is Mr. Rubel. We have time for one last question and I'll turn it back to you to do that and then give us final instructions.
Operator: Absolutely, sir. Today's final question comes from Ron Epstein with BofA. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Sorry about that. I was on mute. So just maybe a bigger picture question. When we listen to the earnings calls of the group, every company tells us that they're well positioned relative to the defense budget. And I'm not saying you're not. But my question is this, if the budget flattens with the change in administration and the deficit and so on and so forth, where do you expect to see some pressure in the budget? How do you dodge that? I mean it seems like you are, but like where would you not want to be? Does that make sense?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, let me tell you, I never speak to anybody else's portfolio, but a couple of observations. It's been my experience that the best antidote for budget reductions, are well-performing, well-supported programs of record. We have all of those. Almost every single one of our programs are on schedule at or below cost. That is when the budget tiers get their night out. Those are almost always the last fall. So that's, I think, a longer perspective to look at. But look, if you look at the U.S. Navy, submarines are its top priority and the Columbia in particular. And why is that? It's because submarines remain a singular competitive advantage, a critical competitive advantage for the United States with near-peer competitors and peer competitors. So I am quite confident that given my belief that the defense budget is driven by the threats that are key elements of our Marine group, growth will be nicely supported. We believe that the Navy will continue to need destroyers The DDG-51 is proving to be a very versatile program platform that can take additional missions. And then with our auxiliary yard out at ASCO, with the exception of the nuclear powered carriers, and nuclear submarines, all these navy's fleets needs gas and the gas needs to get there safely, fastly and pumped efficiently, and that's our new oiled program. So with respect to the Army, I gave you a little bit of color before, but the Army has been quite clear, even in a constrained budget. They will maintain their modernization priorities. They have been both privately and publicly quite articulate about that. And then in terms of the shorter cycle businesses, in the old days, when you were dialing for dollars as a budget tier, you go to the O&M accounts and start cutting the IT budgets, that's not possible anymore. These IT systems are critical to the mission of these agencies, whether that's within DoD or outside DoD. So that as a source of funds is increasingly less likely. And I think, frankly, insulated, given the criticality of IT and then within -- to the war fight and DoD into other missions. And then within our Mission Systems, there's a beauty to having a diverse portfolio of long franchise programs. And I will tell you that we're quite secure in many of those franchise programs because they are, in some cases, unique and in some cases, tied to high-growth nationally critical areas to think against submarines. So, I think it's a height of hubris to assume that any organization is immune from constraints in budget. But performance matters criticality to the war fit matters. And when I look across our portfolio, I'm pretty comfortable that we are in very good stead.

Operator: Thank you, sir. And this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  Please also note, today's event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Rocco  and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Howard and good morning. Before I address the company's quite good performance in the quarter, let me briefly update you on COVID-19's continuing impact. As we discussed last quarter, we're working hard to protect our people. We adhere to CDC guidelines, encourage social distancing and have a mandatory mask policy. We continue to have lower infection rates in our surrounding communities. To-date of our 100,000 employees, we've had about 1,800 cases. 1,500 of whom have fully recovered and are back to work while many of the others are working from home, during their quarantine. In short, the pandemic remains an issue. But we've dealt with the help of our workforce in effective way and continue to do so. As we turn to our results in the quarter, I'll spend less time on quarter over year ago quarter and year-to-date comparisons that are well stated in Exhibit's A and B to the press release. And instead focus my remarks on operations, the significant sequential improvement and meaningful development in the quarter. Regarding the company's third quarter performance as you can discern from our press release. We've recorded earnings of $2.90 per diluted share on revenue of $9,430 million operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net income of $834 million all very significant improvements over the second quarter. As one would expect, revenue was down $330 million or 3.4% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $132 million or 10.9% and net earnings were down $79 million. For the temps  businesses alone the year-to-date revenue is up $98 million and operating earnings are down only $51 million. All up, the defense business has been seriously impacted but is holding up and recovering well as you will see in the details. As you all are aware most of the revenue and earnings shortfall this year to-date has occurred in our aerospace segment which saw significant write-off last quarter associated with reductions and force at both Gulfstream and jet aviation. However, there's mostly good news for both companies this quarter which I'll get into shortly. But before I get into the details of the operating level particularly at aerospace and GDIT where we experience significant improvement. I want to spend a moment on the resilience and strength of the company's backlog. Total backlog of $81.5 billion is down $1.1 billion against the end of last quarter. Funded backlog at $60.2 billion is down only $950 million. However, total estimated contract of $132 billion is down only $336 million against the end of last quarter. While these numbers are down slightly, they represent a solid and enduring backlog.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I'll start with some comments on our cash performance in the quarter and our latest thinking on how the year is shaping up. Cash from operations in the quarter was $1.1 billion and our free cash flow was $903 million, 108% conversion rate. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $11.9 billion down almost $400 million from the second quarter. As anticipated when we started the year, the cash performance has stepped up markedly in each sequential quarter this year and consistent with that original expectation we have a big fourth quarter ahead of us. That said, our forecast for the quarter is right in line with what the fourth quarter has looked like in each of the past three years, so not an unusual task at this point. So with that at backdrop, we continue to target free cash flow for the year to be in 80% to 85% of net income range. The biggest variables in achieving that mark will be Gulfstream order activity and our ongoing efforts to support our supply chain as we settle on production and delivery rates for next year. You heard Phebe's remarks on that subject so assuming things continue to trend favorably as we've seen of late, we've got a path to close on our cash target for the year. On the defense side, our Pentagon customer continues to lean forward with accelerated contract payments to support the industrial base and we in turn continue to do the same for our supply chain. Through the end of the third quarter, we've received approximately $400 million of accelerated payments from our customers and advanced more than $1.7 billion to our suppliers. To the extent, we eventually see additional relief from our US government customer in the form of incremental contract funds to offset the ongoing impact of COVID to our business. We'll include the benefit of that relief in our results only when it's authorized and funds are made available. As I mentioned earlier, our net debt is down to just below $12 billion and our interest expense in the quarter was $118 million versus $114 million in the third quarter of 2019. That brings the interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $357 million roughly unchanged from $350 million for the same period in 2019. At this point, we expect interest expense for the year to be approximately $480 million.
Howard Rubel: Thanks Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Rocco , would you please remind participants how to enter the queue.
Operator: Absolutely.  Today first question comes from Ron Epstein with BoA. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: I'm sorry there'll be a bunch of questions on Gulfstream, so I'll just start with defense. Right, I'll leave those for other folks. In the naval business I know there's been some discussions, some whispers about a III Virginia-class. What do you think of that? Is that a possibility? And what that means for you guys, if that happens? And then I have one follow-up after that.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, so we've been talking to our Navy customer about the ability of - essentially the supply chain and the facilities to ramp up production and as you can imagine, we're developing plans to do that as well. But you'll note that in all of the recent discussions about US National Security strategy and particularly the Navy's articulation of the criticality of the size of its fleet submarines figure prominently in all of those conversations because they remain a national competitive advantage for the United States. So we'll continue to work with our customer and we'll see where that takes us at the moment. We're not planning for that increase. But if the nation needs it, we'll accommodate it.
Ron Epstein: And then my follow-up is kind of dovetail's in one of our comments. When you look at there's been discussion, I guess Secretary Esper was talking about 550-foot  Navy, a portion of that is unmanned under sea vehicles. What opportunities that present for General Dynamics?
Phebe Novakovic: Well let's think about in two parts. In the first instance, it's the job of our shipyards to integrate those capabilities into the existing platforms and we're very good as you can imagine that integrating mission payloads into our ships and our submarines. With respect to individual lines of business within the unmanned world. Mission systems has a number of lines of business that have been very active for quite some time in the undersea domain and unmanned under sea domain, so I would imagine those continue to grow. It's all going to be about performance and their performance throughout testing has been outstanding. So I think there's a lot more to come on that.
Ron Epstein: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: The aerospace impact of $541 million of COVID. What do you base that on? Is that deliveries you plan to do, that you didn't do? And then given that it looks like the decremental margins on the revenue you missed were 22%. Would the profitability value soon  the profitability would have been even better if you've gotten most deliveries?
Phebe Novakovic: So think about what we did, very quickly in response to COVID. We lowered our production. We did it in two respects. One, to better meet demand but very importantly to allow the supply chain to catch up so that is really what has driven all of the - overriding factor that's driven all of the performance at Gulfstream. Now within that, we've also quite predictably and as we've told right sized that business and we'll continue to do so. So that we manage our margins and nearly push them to be as high as they can. So I think Gulfstream has done a remarkable job in bringing down its cost both for restructuring and then cost savings and productivity. So with respect to the profitability of Gulfstream I think we've seen really some good discipline actions to size the business supportingly  and then continue to perform superbly on the manufacturing line.
Cai von Rumohr: And then the last one, Jason mentioned he had $400 million at advances COVID cares related and yet you advanced a $1.70 billion  supplier or so, so that's a delta or like a $1.3 billion when do you expect to recover that? When do you expect that to burn down to near zero?
Jason Aiken: So Cai, keep in mind that's an accumulative number that's been building throughout the year and so that sort of paves in and then it gets phased out and paid in and phased out overtime. That said, you'll note if you look at our cash flow statement and our exhibits our receivables and unbilled receivables in the quarter as well as payables and on the supply side. Continue to be a bit of an OWC  headwind for us and that's really all attributable to lot of that timing. So I think you'll see that phased out as this pandemic starts to abate and the customer sort of moves its payment practices back to normal and we'll in kind sort of move back to normal cadence from our perspective. In the meantime, our priority is to make sure that our supply chain which is, we're all in a symbiotic relationship here and what's good one for is good for other, we've got to continue to support the elements of that supply chain that needed particularly on the smaller business side and so we're going to continue to do that as the impact of the pandemic continues.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: First of all, perhaps on GDIT. You had quite a few comments there Phebe about the demand environment, the bidding that this business has been doing. Have we finally turned the corner in this division? And can we expect revenues to accelerate from here and to hold onto this operating margin?
Phebe Novakovic: The operating margin - we'll take that in inverse orders was severely decremented last quarter by a loss that we had on a legacy GDIT program as well as the impact of COVID. And if you recall, we had significant number of our workforce to were covered under the CARES Act and Jason I don't know if you recall those numbers, but it was a lot of revenue that carried in the earnings .
Jason Aiken: About $150 million in the quarter.
Phebe Novakovic: So those are considerable headwinds GDIT has from the very get go, had superior industry leading and not by a little, but by a lot EBITDA margins and I would expect that performance to continue. Here's a predicate that we finally turned the corner. We can quibble over the predicate. But let me just give you some idea of what's going on the order front at GDIT. In the quarter our overall win rate is an excess of 75%, our re-compete win rate was over 90% and I think it is really just a positive factor that in the third quarter with our largest quarter over 50% of the awards coming from competitive new work. And so I think that's an important indicator of this business on a going forward basis. We had a number of nice enduring wins in the quarter. our performance has been very, very strong on our existing contracts. So I very much like where this business is and again, they've continued to have outstanding cash performance.
Robert Stallard: Okay and then on the aerospace division. I was wondering if you could give us any clarity on the order intake in terms of whether any differences by model or by region that were notable in the third quarter.
Phebe Novakovic: Well I think I noted in my remarks that the 650 led the order book. That has been an extraordinarily successful airplane and continues to endure and successfully endure. So internationally, we saw more of a pickup. I was pretty I think fulsome in my remarks about the demand environment. But we saw good order activity internationally.
Robert Stallard: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland: Phebe, I wondered if you might talk a little bit about the performance at EB. I'm pretty intrigued by the margins given the COVID cost that you've outlined year-to-date. I mean obviously those come through the reimbursement of those, the treatment there, just implies you guys have found some performance efficiencies there. I wondered if you could speak to that.
Phebe Novakovic: So electric boat had continued to find and will continue to find performance improvement as well as cost cutting. This is a very efficient yard that's getting better and better at what they do. So I expect their performance to continue and as I noted in my remarks, we're - all of that top line growth we're going to push for margin expansion. We're going to see bottom line growth that the more that we can accelerate that bottom line growth, the better and that's all about productivity and efficiency at electric boat and they've done a superb job in the last four quarters even within this environment of driving productivity improvements. If you think about it and this is just not with respect to the shipyard, but across all of our operating divisions. The COVID has amplified the underlying strength of the operations in this business to the extent that they're driven by disciplined, continuous improvement that helped manage any crisis including this pandemic. So we're continuing to see each and every one of our businesses improved their bottom line performance on the operating side. Now we've long talked about that the strong operations are the key to financial success that and good contract bidding. So I think you'll continue to see this march toward productivity improvements in electric boat is leading the win. More to come.
Carter Copeland: Okay, great. Thank you for the color.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Phebe, just a quick. You discussed portfolio shaping in your opening comments. so I wanted to get your thoughts on future portfolio shaping. Are you considering any further divestitures or additions to the portfolio? Do you think that there are any holes in the portfolio right now that you need to fill? Just any color you can provide on just how you're thinking about it right now?
Phebe Novakovic: Richard, I know how much you like that but you know I think - portfolio shaping is only effectively discussed after the fact. So we're always looking for opportunities to improve and focus our activities. But it's really no comment in the moment. There's really nothing on our horizon at the moment. We're sticking to our operations doing what we do best.
Richard Safran: Okay and as a follow-up at mission. You noted expansion into naval air and electronic systems. I want to know if you could elaborate on that a bit more versus share gains, new contract wins versus expansion into new markets, just any color you could provide there.
Phebe Novakovic: These are really within our four, that we've had continuing contract wins and that is a business where we've done a fair amount of portfolio shaping because they've got some nice growth in looking at in front of them. I talked about those cyber defense, tactical communications we have, a decades long history and expertise and in the nuclear triad that will continue to grow and missile fire control as well as short position navigation and timing. In a world where on the battlefield GSP reliability is questionable, that's a key and critical factor. That we have developed over quite some time and very strong expertise and so I think it's important when you see these really critical important franchises that you divest yourself of non-business  and that's exactly what we've done.
Richard Safran: Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Phebe you mentioned earlier about leveraging the breadth of GD of a corporation for opportunities and there were some things that really stood right into that like unmanned, under sea. But when I think of General Dynamics over the long history, I thought of the units it's operating very independently driven by numbers within the unit. Does this suggest that you're thinking differently about how you manage from the corporate center?
Phebe Novakovic: So look I believe in centers of excellence at the business units in which they concentrate on the really value creation levers at their disposal. That said, we have a long history of our units working together and mission systems in particular. They've heavily embedded in combat systems platform within the marine group and within GDIT. So we're moving increasingly in response to the market I might add increasingly working on joint activities between those two businesses and they worked well together, they blend well together. So there's no fundamental change in how we see our business across our portfolio. I really do think people excel when they stick to what they know, but when we have opportunities to augment that value creation through partnerships across the units, we've done - so we've done for over 20 years.
Doug Harned: One of the opportunities could be in the area of 5G and you've won contracts both at GDIT and at mission systems related to that. Is this something that we should expect to see as a strong growth area and when might we see, if that's the case?
Phebe Novakovic: Well I think the department is still working through - how to operationalize 5G? it is an enormous capability advantage for our Warfighter and we have been a part of both their planning and thinking it, at our customer levels for some time. And the way we define how we operate both in the moment and gloom for to how to meet our customer needs so as their need and the clarity around it's used, with respect to 5G in this instance gets increasingly clear. We'll be there to work with them.
Doug Harned: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks for the color on Gulfstream as you looked out to 2021 deliveries. With regard to that, I think your forecasting $1.13 billion in EBIT in 2020, would you still expect some Gulfstream EBIT growth in 2021 despite lower deliveries?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, let us continue to work that. But in addition to efficiency, the number of airplanes delivered really drive EBIT. So we've got a long way to go in determining what the final plan is. But I try to be very specific in my remarks about how to think about the delivery plan that we have at least at its current notional level. It's really the 550 has gone away and we're not able in this demand environment to replace it with new airplanes. But our new airplane models that we have anticipated. So the production is going to be very similar on our existing fleet, with a little bit of decrement on the mid-sized cabin. So I think that's all we can say in the moment about any specificity around the future.
David Strauss: Okay and as a follow-up I guess Jason on free cash flow as we think about next year. How much potentially could that conversion number bump up? I mean is 100% conversion next year out of the question at this point.
Jason Aiken: I don't want to say anything is out of the question, David. I think what we're focused on is growing free cash flow year-over-year and obviously the two major muscle movers there, that have really been all part of the operating working capital side of that story on the one, the combat systems international program we've told you, I think a good bit about that throughout this year and this is on a trajectory, it sort of set on a path with timing to eventually unwind that working capital over the next three years and then the other side obviously is Gulfstream with the inventory build that really is largely associated with three different aircraft models with test aircraft and the unwinding of that both those test aircraft as well as just general inventory build into the new aircraft models is all going to be predicated on the macroeconomic recovery and when that production rate gets back into full stride and starts to unwind that. So I don't want to put too many caveats around it. But I think the most important takeaway is we expect to see growing free cash flow year-over-year and we'll work out the details as to whether we get to 2% or above 100% as we were projecting before the pandemic.
David Strauss: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Robert Springarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Springarn: Two quick ones, Phebe for you. I know you talked about Gulfstream demand but I just wanted to ask from one other angle. Has the customer mix lately since COVID changed between the number of high net worth individuals versus corporate buyers, so that's the first question on Gulfstream?
Phebe Novakovic: Well let me address that, I talked about that in my remarks. That I think there's a lot of uncertainty with respect to the economy, political uncertainty and then we still have highly restricted travel restrictions across the world. So that is an issue. That's going to affect corporate buyers, but as I also noted we're seeing international pick up is nice and high net worth individuals continue to be in the market. So as the economy's recovery. We'll see diminution in inflection rate. We'll see a pickup in all of that.
Robert Springarn: But see what I'm getting at is, is the virus causing people I guess the high net worth group to want to travel privately, where they might not have before?
Phebe Novakovic: Well I think it's driving motive to people is very difficult. But the high net worth individuals have always been an important part of our portfolio and they remain so.
Robert Springarn: Okay and I had a quick one for Jason and that's just on mission systems and applied margin in Q4. It sounds like the guidance holds in the mid-14, so just what's driving that fourth quarter?
Jason Aiken: I think what you're looking at there is mostly a mix issue for that business. As Phebe talked about as well with some of that portfolio shaping some of that is to get out of non-core businesses and by association in many cases, some less than desired margin businesses, so that has an uplift effect as well. So I think they're expecting to see a little bit of rebound and some pent-up demand that they've experienced over the past several months that will drive some of that product flow through which will bring some strong mix based incremental margin in the quarter.
Operator: Thank you and our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Couple of quick questions was the book-to-bill of the 650 in the quarter above one.
Phebe Novakovic: Well let's not parse that out for you, but it was quite wholesome. As I said that's a spectacular airplane that continues to be in demand.
George Shapiro: Okay and then just one for you Jason, can you clarify a little bit the impact on the free cash from the $400 million that you received and you gave out $1.8 billion. I mean if I look at the balance sheet in Q3 it looks like between the working capital would have been $410 million worse  with receivables and unbilled receivables and etc. and so I'm just trying to reconcile what the actual impact on the cash in a quarter was from your earlier comment.
Jason Aiken: Just to clarify George, I think the numbers you're quoting from the cash flow statement are pretty much en pointe as it relates to the impact of OWC in the quarter. the numbers on the payment advances and accelerations from our customers and to our suppliers. Keep in mind, that's not accumulative $1.3 billion of implied pent up cash on the balance sheet as of the end of the quarter. as we're accelerating, this is what I was trying to get into on an earlier question. As we're accelerating cash to suppliers, we're helping keep them going on an ongoing basis from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. so if they've got implicit receivables that are due 60 days from now and we're accelerating that to paying immediately. Well 60 days later that payment was due and so that kind of comes off the balance sheet naturally. But cumulatively we've been accelerating overtime for call it the past five, six months in excess of $1.7 billion to those suppliers. So you've got to kind of reconcile that with the in the quarter what was the net billed of OWC which speaks to the numbers you were speaking to coming off the cash flow statement. so that's kind of how you reconcile those two concepts.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joseph DeNardi: Phebe, it wasn't too long ago that you used to provide kind of backlog duration by platform at Gulfstream. Would you be willing to provide that now just given some of the changes in build rates that you're seeing? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: That was appropriate when we had all existing long-term airplanes that had been in the backlog for some time. This is a whole new fleet and we're not going to start that until these have been in our production for some time. It is a material difference in the kinds of airplanes that we have, these are all new model and frankly as you all know we are the only airplane manufacturer with - we are truly clean sheet airplanes and it's best just to focus on how well we're doing in selling those. I think it is an important indicator that by the end of the fourth quarter, we're going to have 90 of these 500s and 600s in customers hand and let's not forget also we've got over 450, G650s out in the fleet. It's pretty impressive, if you ask me.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay, yes understood. And then just on GDIT. I think the traditional metric that folks look at to kind of understand growth as book-to-bill and book-to-bill there, for you all is okay, is that expected .
Phebe Novakovic:  on revenue. I think it's quite nice.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay, so that's what you expect from that business going forward. There's not an expectation that book-to-bill improves materially there?
Phebe Novakovic: We're going to have some variances over the quarter. but you know look there's - I wouldn't say that we don't expect book-to-bill to stay the same in perpetuity. It's all going to depend on the win rates in any given quarter and when the customer start deciding all of this enormous pent up backlog proposals, they've got in front of them. And as you can well imagine the velocity in which these contracting decisions are made on the part of the contracts or the part of the customers have slowed down by COVID. So we'll get through all of that and the key areas for us to win more than our fair share and this business is doing I think quite well in that regard.
Joseph DeNardi: Thank you.
Howard Rubel: Operator, we'll take one more question please.
Operator: Absolutely and our final question today will come from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Phebe, I wonder if you could talk a little bit. I know you don't give multi-year guidance. But maybe in kind of a qualitative way. Thinking about the growth in marine that's going to be driven by Columbia, just so we have maybe some way to size the magnitude of that in the coming years and have some guardrails around it and are aware of the timing of any kind of occasionally we see, picks up and growth as programs move from development to production and kind of when those happen. Any additional color around that?
Phebe Novakovic: So I think the way to think about the future and while this will be somewhat lumpy on a going forward quarterly basis. The fact that 50% of our growth this year has been in Columbia. I think it's a nice indicator of what this is going to mean to us in the future. Electric boats alone size will be double in the next five to six years. It's already quite a large business and it will continue to grow. This is a - as we've been talking about for sometime an enormous program of critical national importance and we've geared up to both the  to support it as well as prepared all of our manufacturing processes to support it. I'll give you one little note that to give you a sense of what's going to propel this growth. We go into production on Columbia with 80% of the construction drawings done compared to 43% on Virginia and Virginia was one-month successful program the department has ever seen. So that tells that all of the growth that's embedded in those current budget numbers and future year budget numbers within the Department of the Navy are going to be able to be capitalized by us in nice, nice top line growth and then as I noted. We'll continue to work on margin expansion. So we'll give you a sense of what next year looks like and overtime as we really get into the - in the fourth quarter call and overtime. If we really get into full rate production on Columbia. You'll get also lot of clarity on what the future looks like.
Seth Seifman: Great, that's all from me today. Thanks very much.
Operator: I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Rubel.
Howard Rubel: Thank you very much for joining our call today and as a reminder. Please refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release, highlights presentation and outlook. If you have any additional questions. I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-29 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Chad and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainty. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard and good morning all. Before I address the company's performance in the quarter, let me briefly discuss how COVID-19 is continuing to impact us. We continue in a professional and proactive way to create a safe work environment for our people adhering to CDC guidelines, encouraging social distancing and instituting a company-wide mandatory mask policy. We temperature screen our employees and send those home who fail. These procedures have ensured that we have lower infection rates than the locales in which we operate. Of our over 100,000 employees globally we have had 515 cases to-date less than one half of 1%. As you would expect we continue to incur significant  in addition  considerable program impacts which we estimate to be around $127 million by the end of the second quarter. The most significant impact appears that later in my remarks. On the good news front with respect to Congress all of our major programs are well supported in the congressional markups of the defense funding bills. As we turn to our results in the quarter, I will date comparisons that are well stated in the exhibits to the press release and focus my remarks on the operations and the significant non-recurring items in the quarter. Regarding the company's second quarter performance as you can discern from my press release we reported earnings of $2.18 per fully diluted share on revenues of $9.26 billion operating earnings of $841 million and net income of $625 million. As one would expect revenue was down $291 million or 3% against the second quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $249 million or $22.8% and net earnings were down $181 million. The defense side of the business was down very modestly against the year ago quarter and even less year-to-date. For the defense business in the first half revenue is down only six tenths of a percent and operating earnings are down 3.7% on a 30 basis point lower operating margin. Most of the revenue and earnings challenges in shortfall occurred at GDIT and in our aerospace segment which was particularly impacted by jet aviation. I will comment on this in considerable detail later in my remarks. We experience solid growth at combat systems and marine systems in both the quarter and the first half along with declines in revenue at GDIT and mission systems in part caused by the divestiture of our  business mission systems. However, mission systems had growth and operating earnings for both the quarter and the half on significantly improved operating margins.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I will start with some observations about our balance sheet and liquidity position following our first full quarter of operations influenced by the pandemic. We generated free cash flow of $622 million in the quarter a 100% net earnings conversion and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion. Importantly, operating working capital remained essentially flat during the quarter even as we've advanced in excess of $1.1 billion to our suppliers to support their liquidity compared with approximately $360 million advanced to us by our customers over the same period.
Phebe Novakovic: Now let me do my best to give you an updated forecast as I promised at the end of the first quarter in an effort to be as granular as possible in the midst of significant uncertainty. Our aerospace forecast given to you at the end of the last quarter appears to be holding fairly well. We expect about $100 million less in revenue than forecast 90 days ago roughly $8.4 billion and operating earnings of $1.13 billion that is about $20 million less than I gave you 90 days ago. Given everything at work here these are very modest changes. With respect to the defense businesses the impact is now more apparent. We're holding our full-year targets for combat systems for both revenue and earnings. Marine systems has about $200 million of sales pressure but it is holding its earning target even assuming an extended strike at Bath. Mission systems is also holding its revenue and earnings forecast with the exception of the $150 million of divested revenue that Jason discussed. Finally, GDIT has identified between $300 million and $400 million of revenue degradation and $130 million reduction in forecasted earnings including the $40 million charge on the international program I discussed previously. So on a company-wide basis we see annual revenue of about $38.4 billion and operating earnings of about $4.2 billion. This rolls to an EPS of $11 to $11.10 about a $0.30 reduction from what we forecasted at the end of the first quarter. All in all we weathered the storm of the second quarter reasonably well. This will be the low point of the year as we and many of the analysts had anticipated. Finally, as you can see from the highlights pro forma chart we've provided with the earnings release absent COVID the underlying operations of the company are quite solid with double-digit first half EPS growth. That concludes my remarks and I will turn the call back to Howard for questions.
Howard Rubel: Thank you Phebe. As a reminder we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate.  could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.
Operator: Absolutely sir.  Today's first question comes from Peter Arment with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Jason, Phebe last quarter you highlighted a lot of details around just kind of the health of the Gulfstream backlog. You also mentioned a couple defaults that you expected that might come back. Maybe you could just give us an update on what you're seeing regarding kind of the health of the customers and what are you seeing on the -- regarding the sales cycle? I know you mentioned that there was quite challenge this quarter.
Phebe Novakovic : So our backlog is holding up pretty strongly which is in marked contrast to 2008-09 for example where the backlog experienced some significant erosion. While it's very difficult to sell airplanes in fact impossible over the telephone. We were in constant contact with our customers who expressed the same needs and the same requirements as they had going into -- going into this downturn but look implied in your question I think is a little bit about the demand environment. So let me talk to you a little bit about that. As I said we've continued to talk to our customers and we continue to see their interests much the same. We rebuild our backlog but this isn't we've held our backlog and rebuilt our pipeline but this is an interesting downturn. Unlike previous downturns, this one is not driven by anything in the economy itself or in the economies of the world itself. It's driven by an exogenous force impacting the economies with closure and summonses of entire sectors and certainly slowdowns among many others. So that means I believe that it is very hard to predict with any level of certainty and assurance what that economic recovery looks like across the world including most particularly the United States. So when we look at where we are right now at Gulfstream we've seen the beginning of it what would appear to be an increase in demand but it's way too soon to be able to tell the slope of that recovery.
Peter Arment: Yes. And just as a follow-up to that Phebe is there any, has there been any pickup in defaults or is it still been holding as expected?
Phebe Novakovic : Holding as expected but I think we had five in the quarter but holding up pretty darn well. We haven't seen many defaults. That as I said differentiates this downturn from all of the other two or the two that I lived through the 2001 tech bubble and then 08/09.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Well, I apologize. It looks like our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning guys. Phebe could you give us an update on what's going on at Bath Iron Works because I know there was some labor stuff and some work disruption if you could update us there?
Phebe Novakovic : So we are working quite closely with the federal appointed mediator. So I think it's best to be somewhat quiet at this time, silent at this time but I would note that across our company we have many-many union partners and in all respects we have very strong decades-long positive working relationships with them. This union appears unfortunately be the one exception. So we just need to work through this and as I said because we're working with the mediator, I think we're best to sort of say nothing at the point but in any case, given their size and the fact that they all are smart shipyard they really had an immaterial impact on the quarter.
Ron Epstein: Got you and then maybe the one follow-up on land systems. Have you seen much of an impact yet are you expecting to see much of an impact on the COVID, on the international portion of that business be it that for some countries the spending that they're doing to stimulate their economies potentially COVID impact on spending?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So if you're talking about in the quarter, I think it was pretty clear about what those impacts were but in terms of the demand, first of all that we don't see any of our in production vehicles being impacted in the slightest. I mean these are highly performing programs that are very much in demand by our international customers. On a going forward basis, we still see that the demand, it's interesting, it's been my and you and I have talked about this it's been my long-held view that whether it's in the United States or in any of our allied nations that demand is really driven by the threat of the perception of threat and in all respects, I think there's a general consensus that the threat has not dissipated. In fact arguably some of our potential adversaries have become, have raised additional questions. So I think with respect to our overseas markets, I see a fair amount of stability right now. We'll see going forward but not hearing a lot at the grassroots level on any pending economic or any pending in defense cuts.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So Phebe, good for Gulfstream given the $42 million in severance, kind of as I go through the mix, I have a little trouble getting to your number was there a big cut back in R&D and SG&A or were the accrual rates on any of the newer programs 500/600 increased in the quarter.
Phebe Novakovic : So look we are, in the quarter we had the severance. We had lower R&D. We expect that to continue in the year really as a result of some of the right sizing we're doing and we had disadvantageous as I noted in my remarks mix. There were several 650s to international customers that because of, it entirely because of COVID travel related restrictions we couldn't deliver. So I think if you add those up along with the pre-owned you'll see that sort of gets you to the number. That helps?
Cai von Rumohr: A little bit. Last question when you look at --
Phebe Novakovic : Come on Cai, I miss the question somehow.
Cai von Rumohr: Well, no I mean, so R&D was a lot lower is that I mean because you did have the disadvantageous mix? What I am trying to say is that I was surprised the profit was as strong as it was given the severance and I guess you answered it when you said lower?
Phebe Novakovic : Well, okay I am sorry. I misunderstood. So the underlying operations are quite effective and in fact on a production level we are really humming nicely. So I think that was a significant contribution. I know it was a significant contribution to our costs. Like we've been -- as you know we took some charges that we needed to take. We had some mix issues but this company performed beautifully operationally and that's reflected in and what we consider to be in the environment a pretty good margin.
Cai von Rumohr: And just a quick follow-up, when you look at demand for your products, can you give us some characterization in terms of where is the interest coming? For example, is it coming from international, from domestic, high net worth corporate buyers? Any color would be great.
Phebe Novakovic : So as I noted, Europe and the far East has been pretty active. In the United States, we talk to all of our customers and potential customers quite frequently but we've been a little slower to get back into the order execution phase though the interest remains quite intense and their needs are the same; nothing has changed about that. This is just a question of timing. We've got to get some of the economic uncertainty behind us but look, we entered this downturn in a very strong position with the best portfolio of products unmatched by any with a great service, the best in the industry service and support business and by far the strongest financial position. So given that nothing is materially changed that we can see in the nature of the orders on a going forward basis, we expect to emerge out of this stronger even than when we went in.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hey thanks very much and good morning. Jason, I was wondering what's the appropriate level of working capital for across General Dynamics that you guys can potentially settle out on at some point in the future and ideally if you could express it as a percentage of sales?
Jason Aiken: Yes. I don't know that I'd peg it as a percentage of sales so much that it's clearly at this point at an elevated state. We probably I think over the past couple years about what we're seeing in the combat systems group, particularly on the large international program as you're well aware at the beginning of this year. We'll see that continue I think in a more accelerated way over the next two three years. So that'll have a good tailwind to it in terms of reducing the working capital level and then the other big piece of course is Gulfstream. As we've talked about when you're in a mode of introducing new models that naturally comes with a working capital build associated with the test articles as well as the initial production ramp and inventory of those models and then as you get them into full rate production you start to see that inflection point and see that turn. We had been expecting that to happen this year but of course with the disruptions that we've seen associated with the pandemic that has caused the production and delivery schedule to move a little bit to the right and as a result I think the inflection point with the working capital moves a little bit to the right but we ought to see that start to come down reasonably starting at some point in the next year and compounding that with the combat systems’ improvements in working capital, I think those two big muscle movers will see us having a good favorable impact to our free cash flow performance over the next two three years.
Seth Seifman: All right. Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, maybe you could talk to the second half implied margin transit at aerospace obviously pretty robust bounce back and maybe talk about what that means for ‘21? Is this 15% that you're talking about in the second half, a road map to ‘21 in any way?
Phebe Novakovic : So our margin performance this year and frankly into next will benefit significantly by the charges that we took and paid for in the quarter. So that is a significant benefit. We also see a more advantageous mix to our deliveries particularly if I am assuming that we don't get a worsening of international travel restrictions or we get zero abatement in them. So a path where we implied we've got a clear path to 70 to 75 deliveries as I said our operations are performing well. We have a plan to deliver each and every one of those airplanes. So we're comfortable in the moment that trajectory while steep is quite achievable. So going into ‘21 all the benefit from this year's cost reductions and rationalization will clearly benefit ‘21 margins.
Myles Walton: So you could maintain the second half margins into ‘21 or maybe is that  --
Phebe Novakovic : Well, it's going to be a little lumpy and we're not going to, I am not going to start parsing ‘21 but you can imagine that they will benefit from them.
Myles Walton: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: Hey. Thank you. Good morning. Jason, following up on the cash generation question, can you talk about how the rest of the year shapes up and kind of what brings you into that range and then also obviously things should get better going forward to get back that the more consistent 100% with all that cash coming towards you though, what is the capital allocation thought and decision process going forward,  purchase any in second quarter but how's the capital allocation conversation going at this point?
Jason Aiken: So as it relates to the outlook on cash I think you'll see this year frankly look quite similar to the way it's looked over the past couple years. It's a fairly steady and steep improvement in the free cash performance in the third and fourth quarters. That's become a more frankly typical pattern for us over the past several years and so you'll see a, I think a particularly strong fourth quarter and again, I think that has to do with some of that working capital starting to unwind in the fourth quarter and I think as I described in the earlier question we expect to see some of that working capital unwind in a more meaningful way into 2021 and frankly even ‘22 and ‘23. So those are really the underpinnings of where we see the free cash flow start to get to back -- not only back to 100% but we've been expecting it to get up above 100% as we look at it in the next couple years and it really is all about unwinding those elements of working capital. As it relates to capital deployment I will turn it back over to Phebe perhaps to answer that question. 
Phebe Novakovic : So I think in the moment in periods of great uncertainty preserving liquidity is the most important thing. We did not buy any shares in the quarter and we'll hold pat for now. With respect to that we'll continue to honor the dividend as we've told you for years. Our dividend is the one part of capital deployment that is repeatable and predictable. So that's all I think we're going to say about capital deployment at the moment.
Jon Raviv: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. Phebe, when you talk about right sizing the operations at Gulfstream in order to get the margins, get improved margins, how do you think about this medium to longer term? In other words, you're right sizing to a level but I would expect you certainly want the flexibility to take that rate up when demand re-emerges. So how do you balance the two things?
Phebe Novakovic: So let me give you a little bit of color on how we set in any given year, the production rate and then we can talk a little bit more in detail. So and if we talk specifically about ’21, the production rate in ‘21 will depend on the number of airplanes we have in the backlog for delivery in ‘21. The number of airplanes particularly in the third quarter of 2020 that we sell for delivery into third were into 2021 and then our -- how we see demand when we set our plan and all of this is done in the fall and it's part of a multi, it's been a long standing discipline process that we have had for a very long time. So look, that will give us some time if we need to increase our production schedule. We've got some flexibility around that our production plan for next year but it is way too soon to speculate about that but in any case is right sizing, I think that we've done are in many instances permanent. This was a good opportunity to just cut costs and I don't expect under any scenario for all of those costs to come back when revenue increases.
Doug Harned: So this is something that would allow you to hopefully move margins up higher. One of the things that also, I wonder if we could understand a little better is when you think about the G700 and compare that to the G500, the G650, can you talk about how you're leveraging past designs, manufacturing processes and should we see margins rise on the G700 more quickly than these other new programs?
Phebe Novakovic : I would expect that. That is unlike the other two a modification of an existing airplane. So all those lessons learned on the 650 we can apply to the 700 and you can expect us to do quite well as we come down a learning curve which will be obviously less steep. We know how to build this type of airplane. We've done it before.
Operator: And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Phebe Novakovic : Hi David.
David Strauss: Phebe, on GDIT, what proportion of the business contracts or people actually need access to customer facilities and can actually just do the work from home?
Phebe Novakovic : So let me put it to you this way. We've got about 10% of our workforce that is either idle or underutilized and a significant portion of that workforce is in classified area which has been a long-standing series of relationships we've had for many-many years and a good solid partnership that we have with our customers but as it's impossible to do classified work from home. So as our customers sort through how they judiciously and prudently bring back employees in this COVID environment and then how we manage now we augment all of that will sort of depend on going forward where we are. Now right now those costs are being covered by the CARES Act but with no margins. So they've been very dilutive to margin but ultimately this will resolve and it all depends on when our customers believe that they can get back and working at full steam once that some of the COVID uncertainties have been eliminated.
David Strauss: Okay. Great. And could you give a little bit more color on the loss of jet? I guess what was unique about this situation jet as compared to I guess, the rest of your service business and then also the exposure to pre-owned that loss there? How does that mitigate going forward? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic : So jet was really about absorption. That was a headwind that we tend not to have in our other businesses. Revenue went down very, very quickly, there's only so and we can only take the fixed costs out so fast by any given schedule but as I said that will return. That was a one-time impact and they had disproportionately more higher severance charges given the nations in which they work. So that's I think an important element of that. And with respect to the pre-owned, we discipline our inventory of pre-owned very, very, very clearly and with very strict structures. So I don't see us having much material risk on this. This was in the quarter. We're not expecting any on a going forward basis but we'll let you know.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Hunter Keay: Hey thank you. Good morning. Phebe, can you talk a little bit about how the virus is impacting the fractional biz jet market? How it has impacted so far and any potential changes that you see in the landscape going forward out of this? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic : Look let the operators of the fractional businesses talk about that but on a going forward basis we do not see any structural change in this market. We simply don't and we see no evidence to suggest that there would be.
Hunter Keay: Okay and I will just squeeze one more and just to follow up on the comment about the 700 margins. Are you suggesting that margins just to clarify can exceed peak margins on 650 --
Phebe Novakovic : I think that's a little too early to declare victory but let's just put it this way. Everything about this airplane is performing exactly as we hoped in fact better. We have over 100 hours of test on that airplane and it is all indications, all character in all respects is outperforming in some of our specifications. So why does that matter because we really understand this airplane and I think it's premature to say we understand how to build it but it's very premature to say at this juncture that we're going to eclipse those margins but as we get closer to the in-service we get this through tests, we get it through the certification process and we'll have a little bit more color about the timing of the margins and earnings associated with that airplane going forward but this is going to be a very good airplane for us.
Operator: Thank you and our next question today comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski:  Good morning guys.
Phebe Novakovic : Good morning.
Pete Skibitski: Phebe, it looks like you're expecting some back half of your margin expansion at combat relative the first half. I am just wondering is that the Spanish facilities coming online or is there some mixed benefit potentially and --
Phebe Novakovic : So we always ramp in the last half of the year. That's that businesses pattern but really as you quite accurately point out it's at our European land systems but we've got those facilities up and they're at near peak production. So that's behind us with respect to that.
Pete Skibitski: Okay and just, I have lost track of this but the big Spanish and Morocco combat vehicle programs, when you expect to have those under contract if they're not yet?
Phebe Novakovic : Well, I have learned not to speculate on the timing of sovereign governments. I had decisions but I will tell you that we're going to get this and it'll be a nice addition to the backlog.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Howard Rubel: And then operator we'll take one more question. This upcoming one will be our last please.
Operator: Yes sir. And our final question today will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Yes. Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic : Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Phebe, just a couple of quick ones on aerospace. I was wondering if you could tell us what you've been seeing on some of the more short cycle parts of this division such as the aftermarket services in terms of trends in recent months or the FBOs and then secondly pricing. You commented on what you've seen in this down cycle versus previous cycles, how is pricing held up this time versus what you've seen in the past?
Phebe Novakovic : Well, let me answer that in the inverse order. We have seen really no degradation in pricing and as you well know we consider price pressure. So we do not compete on price. We never have and that doesn't change in this kind of environment. So our pricing is holding up pretty well. With respect to the shorter cycle aerospace businesses look those are really volume driven and entirely at the FBO it's volume driven. So the more flying hours we get across all models of airplane the better the FBOs do. Service; services was down but only slightly. It may be a little bit mercurial through the rest of the year but we will have nice performance on service and we expect the mix to improve as well. It was hard for in the second quarter for people to get some of their airplanes in for scheduled maintenance. Most of the scheduled maintenance we did but some of these guys -- it was they couldn't travel. So hard to get the airplane that will resolve.
Robert Stallard: Thank you. 
Howard Rubel: Thank you. Operator we now end this call and thank you all for joining us today. As a reminder please refer to General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and our highlights presentation. If you have any other questions I can be reached 703-876-3117. 
Operator: Thank you sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-29 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Chad and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' first quarter 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainty. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Before I address the company's performance in the quarter, let me take a moment to discuss General Dynamics' response to COVID-19 and its impact on us. We've been designated a national critical infrastructure company and as such are required to continue full operations, which we have done. I am proud of our patriotic employees who have continued to work hard to fulfill their mission in support of our armed forces as we face this crises together. Our men and women in uniform continue to serve and we must as well. Ensuring a safe work environment for our workforce has been and remains our top priority. We have 39,000 employees tele-working from home unfortunately our large manufacturing sites cannot do that. At these sites, we follow CDC recommended guidelines and practice social distancing where possible. We have increased shift work and the use of PPE. We are conducting temperature screening where feasible. As additional screening and ultimately testing become available, we will aggressively implement those as well. Our leadership teams have been and will continue to be in the workplace leading our people. This is early in the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on our business. So far we've experienced some deterioration in efficiency driven by absenteeism at a couple of our facilities. We expect absenteeism to decline as we see the rate of infection slow. We're also incurring rather significant cost to sanitize the work environment in our facilities and to provide additional PPE. We've also seen definite weaknesses in the supply chain particularly with respect to some of Gulfstream suppliers. Gulfstream is working closely with the suppliers who have also been hurt by the disruptions of the commercial airplane OEMs. Hopefully, we can sort our way through these issues, but some of them are difficult. The Department of Defense is accelerating payment to us to support the defense industrial base. We believe that this will prove to be very helpful. Regarding the company's first quarter performance, as you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.43 per diluted share on revenue of $8.75 billion and operating earnings of $941 million and net income of $706 million. Revenue was down $512 million or 5.5% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $73 million or 7.2% and net earnings were down only $39 million or 5.2%.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. The first thing I would like to note is a key accomplishment on the financing front in the quarter. In anticipation of the pending maturity of $2.5 billion of notes in May of this year and given the extreme volatility we've seen in the markets since the outbreak of the pandemic we issued $4 billion of fixed-rate notes in late March at very attractive rates. While this financing was part of our planning pre-COVID-19, the additional liquidity enhances our financial flexibility during the pandemic, particularly in light of the fact that our free cash flow is weighted toward the second half of the year. To that point, our free cash flow in the quarter was negative $851 million. The cash performance in the quarter was impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak most notably at Gulfstream due to delayed customer payments associated with the net 11 airplanes we weren’t able to deliver. As Phebe noted, customer orders were also postponed in the last two weeks of the quarter. On the defense side, we've seen accelerated payments coming from some of our customers starting in the month of April in the form of increased progress payment rates and other contract mechanism, but we've passed those monies on to our suppliers to help sustain our supply base. In fact as of last week, we had received approximately $55 million in accelerated payments from our customers and advanced almost $300 million to our suppliers on an accelerated basis. After all this we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $5.3 billion and a net debt position of $12.7 billion down slightly from this time last year. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $107 million down from $117 million in the first quarter of 2019 on a lower average outstanding commercial paper balance. But for the year, we're revising our interest forecast up to approximately $490 million to reflect the additional borrowing I discussed earlier. Q2 will be the peak interest expense for the year. As Phebe noted, we had ample liquidity including $5 billion in lines of credit which we renewed during the first quarter and we expect the outstanding debt balance to come down over the next couple of quarters as we repay the $2.5 billion maturing in May as well as our commercial paper balance. On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures of $185 million in the quarter were consistent with year ago. We expect CapEx for the year to be down somewhat from our original forecast as we manage that spend in light of the circumstances but still in the range of 2.5% of sales on a reduced sales number. In the quarter we paid $295 million in dividends and spent $500 million on the repurchase of 3.4 million of our shares. This covers the dilution from stock option exercises the we were unable to address last year due to cash constraints plus the anticipated dilution for the current year. For the year we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 85% of net income versus the 85% to 90% we previously forecasted, reflecting the reductions in Gulfstream aircraft production and delivery rates, partially offset by the reduced capital expenditures, cost savings across the company and somewhat lower cash taxes. Speaking of taxes, our effective tax rate was 16.7% for the quarter benefiting from several factors including lower international taxes and increased research and development tax credits. For the year we're lowering our anticipated tax rate from 17.5% to 17%. As Phebe mentioned in her remarks, we finished the quarter with total backlog of $85.7 billion, that's up 24% over this time last year and total potential contract value including options and ideology IDIQ contracts was $124 billion up 20% over the year ago quarter. And just one last thought for you as you consider the quarterly progression throughout the year. Obviously there's more uncertainty than we would normally have at this point in the year but as you might expect, we anticipate the second quarter being the low point in EPS in the range of $0.25 to $0.30 below the first quarter with a steady ramp in the second half to achieve the updated targets that Phebe discussed. Howard, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Howard Rubel: Thanks Jason. As a reminder we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Chad could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Thank you.  And our first question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hi. Good morning. Sorry I was on mute. So I realize this is probably very difficult given where we are in the unprecedented nature of the situation. I think the deliveries you talked about at Gulfstream this year coming out a backlog I think was probably fairly consistent with maybe where people thought and maybe even a bit better. As we look out beyond this year and we think about what might happen to the backlog as we move through the year and as you deliver out backlog, is there any way to kind of I don’t know if there any way to bound that or maybe any way to talk about some of the distinct aspects of this pressure that Gulfstream is seeing now versus periods of pressure in the past?
Phebe Novakovic: So let me address that in two parts. Our reduction in production this year was driven most exclusively by probations in the supply chain. Some of our suppliers entered this crisis somewhat impaired both from exposure to the commercial aviation market and some financial difficulties. The crisis exacerbated that and even before they saw hit, they were having some difficulty keeping up with our original production rate. So we took down production which we believe helps de-risk the current environment and frankly de-risks some of '21 if in fact we see weakening demand. But look with respect to this year's production you can only go as fast as your weakest link in your chain. So that's part one. Part two, which really I think teaming out a bit is how we demand in this environment. And as I think we eluded to we fully expect business aviation to recover in due course. The question is specific timing but this will again be a robust market for us and will lead with a strong portfolio of new products. If you think about it one of the outcomes that could occur as a result of this particular crisis is the business can ill afford to rely on those commercial airline providers who are either financially weak or unpredictable. So the fundamental case for business aviation remains the same if not somewhat strengthened by this crisis and frankly I think there is a case to be made that much will inert of business aviation as a result of this particular crisis. But there is an important reality I think for all of us to comprehend understand this market and that is in all markets up or down we have the distinct advantage in product, service and cost that leads the competition to compete only on price and availability.
Operator: The next question will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on what you might seen in the shorter cycle business jet off the market and the FBOs this quarter and partly in April as well, whether this could be a lead indicator of where the demand environment is going.
Phebe Novakovic: Sure, I think is a particularly unusual environment and that it was worldwide and the fact that all human beings, not just particular sectors. So hence the imposition of travel restrictions both in the United States and elsewhere, that really drove our flying hours. So we saw a considerable decrease in the number of flying hours that we believe will resume when some of these -- some of the travel restrictions begin to ease and people are still a little bit safer in traveling. I'll tell you the loading at most of our service centers remains solid. We've implemented some rolling furloughs at a couple of our smaller sites, scheduling inspections and planned maintenance continue at a good pace but some of the discretionary work I think referred for avionics upgrades have fallen back a bit, but again once we resume normal or begin to approach normal flying cadence that we anticipate that some of this will likewise resolve.
Operator: And the next question will come from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: One for Jason and then one for you Phebe. The one for Jason and maybe you mentioned but if you did, I missed it. If you can reconcile, you have in the back your gross orders and then if you just look at backlog, I guess that's a net number. Is the roughly $300 difference primarily cancellations, which you gave the list in the back there or what is it? And then for you Phebe, in terms of the expectation for deliveries for the year, I assume the second quarter is going to be a lot weaker than the rest of the year and also where the status of the Eisai certification for the 600, thanks?
Phebe Novakovic: Okay. Well, we had four defaults in the quarter. A chunk of those were not for 2020 airplanes. Their customers we expect to see back. With respect to the second quarter, I think deliveries will be stronger, but as you can imagine with the reduction in production we are taking cost out of our business and we'll have some charges around those particularly in any of the risk charges in the moment and so that could -- that depresses second quarter a bit. But deliveries could be we expect them to be higher once and depending on how fast and at what sequence and in what areas these travel restrictions lift. It's very hard if you think about it, it is we need those travel restrictions to kind of abate because people typically come to pick up their airplanes in Savanna or we fly -- we fly them elsewhere to effectually transfer and that's extremely difficult and kind of constrained environment. But as we see some of the rolling reopening both in the United States and outside the United States, we expect some of those deliveries to revolve nicely.
Operator: And our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning. Just Phebe one on the implied Gulfstream decremental margins, I think you took down revenue by about $1.5 billion and you EBIT expectation by about $400 million applying some more mid to high 20 decremental margins. How much of this is driven by just reduced productivity because of production issues, work related issues and supplier issues? The decremental margins are a bit higher than I thought we would see?
Phebe Novakovic: Some of that is based on efficiency particularly as we learn to optimize operating in a CDC driven environment, but some of it is also mix.
David Strauss: Okay. And then a follow up on capital deployment, obviously you have the debt pay down here in May. You guys deal with commercial paper, but how are you thinking about share repurchase in the current environment given maybe political headwinds to doing that versus where your stock price currently sits, thanks?
Phebe Novakovic: I think you're quite right to point out the political concerns, the concerns in the policy arena about stock buybacks but from my perspective in periods of great uncertainty and volatility, maintaining your liquidity and the strength of your balance sheet is key. So we're going to stay on stock repurchases at the moment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland: Phebe, I know each one of these downturns are demand flips in aerospace has its own sort of unique fingerprint and I wondered if you might just kind of help give us some color on what this one is like in terms of your customer conversation I would imagine that the big majority of your customers the Fortune 500 companies out there going through some sort of exercise on the timing of expenditures on aircraft when the tapping revolvers and what not. I just -- how does that discussion, how is that going and then how does that evolve in terms of the timing of those, what I would assume are continued purchases in the future, thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So one of these elements that is distinctly different from the last time that we experienced in the 2008 timeframe, the great recession was that interest remains very active, whereas in the recession it simply stopped because of the impact on multiple key sectors. Here it's really been about more about simply timing. How soon does the economy reopen and how soon can we get travel restrictions back. So the conversations are continuing. That hasn’t stopped, but in terms of translating that activity into orders, some of that is going to take some time as we see how all of the reduction in travel restrictions as well as the stabilization in the economy occur, but we see this more as a question of timing in this environment. As of the moment the backlog is holding up very nicely, which results are distinctly different from the last time, but we're always mindful that if you have worldwide economic crises of the large economies that become really dire, backlog is an issue that we're going to have to follow very carefully and we're being very mindful. This is a company that has been through this kind of environment before albeit for very different reasons and manifesting itself at different ways.
Carter Copeland: And is it fair to characterize the decisions you will make from a production standpoint to get to the lower deliveries s temporary in nature whether it's furloughs or timing related, I guess are you protecting upside in your production capacity for when things return to normal? Is that the right way to think about what you're doing?
Phebe Novakovic: I think the right way to think about it is that when you have changes in your environment, you have to react fairly quickly, postulating the best possible outflow -- postulating the best as you can what various outcomes are like and what we have done is in the moment sized our production so that our supply chain can keep up with it, but also recognizing that it prepares us if in fact demand does increasingly weaken in next year to manage that risk as we'll. So I think we have found our risk as well as we possibly can in the moment, understanding where what we see.
Operator: The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you very much. So number of dealers we've talked to expect as you indicate the demand should pick up later in the year as kind of COVID impact abates, but one of the concerns they have is that basically there's been a weakening in terms of the preowned market. The pricing there is starting to erode and may go down and in particular with the G650 where you have a large install base that preowned G650s would compete with your production. Are you seeing or to what extent are you concerned about potential pricing pressures from the preowned market, thanks?
Phebe Novakovic: We have yet to see any. We done see any significant build up of like new preowned Gulfstream and we've seen no impact on price. That preowned inventory for each of our large cabin including the 650 is well below the market standard threshold. So at the moment, we either have a lot of preowned inventory in our house nor do we see that it is impacted our current demand, nor our current -- our current pricing. So this again is very different than what we saw in the 2008, 2009 timeframe. Preowned is simply not an issue in the moment.
Cai von Rumohr: Thanks so much and one follow-up would be can you give us an update on how you are doing G500, G600 production and the expectation or certification of the G700 in late 2021?
Phebe Novakovic: So let's go in reverse order the G700 continues to performance test -- it's test pattern. So we have about 100 hours under our belt and airplane is performing extremely well. The G500 and G600, of course are going to be some of the change in the production that we have set for the year, some the mix issue but the demand for both of those programs has been wholesome and is increasing. And I think George asked the question that I failed to answer on EASA, and you tease it that as well indirectly. EASA had been slowed by the impact of the MAX. And while I can't speak to them directly in terms of their timing, this has no doubt impacted them as well but we'll get through that and these airplanes, the more that they're in the market, the more people see exactly what these airplanes can do for them and they're pretty impressed.
Operator: The next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Phebe, is 100% of the Gulfstream delivery and revenue outlook reduction that you’ve made here today, is 100% of that from supply chain disruption and inability to fly to deliver airplane disruption and none of it from demand impact?
Phebe Novakovic: Really isn’t demand driven. I think I noted two factors a couple of times, but let me just reiterate as I think I've discussed some fulsome detail but supply chain, but we also have some efficiency issues within these plants within our assembly manufacturing plant as we learn to optimize production under the social distancing rules, additional PPE cleaning as shift work as we've increased the number of shifts. So as we began to optimize that over time in production environment, that will also allow us to mitigate any impacts from some of the inherent inefficiency there, but that was also an issue, but overwhelmingly the predominant issue here was the supply chain. And frankly as I said if you think about it in terms of you simply seen significantly weakening demand. We have done a nice job to de-risk some of '21 and I think that's where you could potentially see demand and one of the salutary benefits of the actions that we're taking today, do provide some risk mitigation for '21. So that's why I've said a couple times, we believe that we've founded our risk in all respects at the moment.
Noah Poponak: Have you seen any -- not just through Q1 but year to date, have you seen any cancellations or deferrals in the existing backlog?
Phebe Novakovic: Yeah I mentioned earlier, we had four and all of whom we have while three of whom we expect to come back but that is all that we've seen today and the backlog of how they're continuing to hold up very nicely. But we recognize that this will de-risk any additional impacts to the backlog, but so far we're not hearing noises coming out of the customer base and the backlog of any note at the moment.
Operator: Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Maybe changing gears a little bit to your navy business, the navy has accelerated its procurement of systems, I mean if you talk to the procurement leadership in the navy and they’ll tell you how they're very proud of the amount of work they put under contract in a short period of time. How are you seeing that in your naval business and how do you expect that to flow through the rest of the year?
Phebe Novakovic: So our navy procurement people have been really leaders and beacons of stability and foresight during this entire crisis. They have increased the velocity at which we've gotten contract awards, we particularly see that on the repair side. Our new ship construction is our large big contracts. I wouldn't expect to see any additional particular increase in velocity on those but we have on the shorter cycle businesses and they have been very, very supportive in understanding the need to undergird the defense industrial supply chain.
Ron Epstein: And then as one follow-on, you mentioned a couple times in your prepared remarks and even in some of the questions that you’ve got some concerns over the supply chain. How do you see that playing out particularly if you’ve got a smaller let's call it a mom-and-pop supplier who is largely commercial aerospace that don’t do much defense work and their supplying into Gulfstream? How are you trying to mitigate that risk?
Phebe Novakovic: So if you can imagine these are all sensitive negotiations. We're working closely with all. We know all of our challenge suppliers are at the moment, working closely with them to get -- to provide on-site mitigation and support where we can and ultimately if we have to bring it in house we will. But we have managed through this and will continue to do so, but there is risk here. It's not without the risk for reasons that I think you all can understand as well as we can.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: Turning to IT for a moment, any visibility or perspective on when we might see some of those nice backlog trends translate into growth when some of those items that you slide might dissipate. And then also can you talk about how IT is supporting the customer in the current environment and how it can be oriented to support new priorities coming out of the coronavirus crisis?
Phebe Novakovic: So one of the elements of GDIT is an enormous agility coupled with their customer intimacy. So as our customers adjust both on the defense Intel and federal civilian environments. We'll work very closely with them on new opportunities. I think one of the challenges is that our customer needs to get back up and in a regular cadence and regular order and that will then drive our ability to attend these sites. While many of our people can work from home. A lot of them have to be on site with the customer and so once the customer gets up in full bore operations, that will drive then additional revenue on our part but look these GDIT has had been very successful in winning additional business that ultimately begins to translate into revenue and profitable revenue at that. So I think we need to particularly on IT get everybody back and working and then have a sense if we have any timing issues from some incremental backed-up impact from the revenue side from just this a bit of a hiatus that some of our customers have taken. But they're positioned for good growth with their backlog. They had superb winning capture rates. So they fit very nicely and comfortably right now in their market space.
Jon Raviv: And just as a follow-up can you talk about how customer conversations in that business might be developing in the current environment where there might be more focus on this aggregated workforces further acceleration of the cloud, further IT monetization, larger implementation of CDC, NIH type work packages. So any sort of thinking about how the national priorities might shift or accelerate coming out of this.
Phebe Novakovic: I don’t know that we have seen anything that one could realistically discern a trend from. I think it's too early. As far as the distributed workforce I think that's way too early. I think we have to look at the efficiency metrics on how that actually plays out as they say a lot of our people need to be on customer sites. But we haven't seen a wholesale strategic or structural shift in the way that our customer is thinking about, either the cloud or its mission in a post COVID environment. I suspect naturally there will be some. Again as we think about how long do we keep social distancing, how long do we keep distancing, how long the integrated shifts and rolling shifts. So I think, some of that will play out, but so far I haven't seen a material of structural change in how our customer is thinking about their mission.
Howard Rubel: And then we have one final question, operator.
Operator: And that question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Jason, maybe this one is for you, given the free cash flow, can you revisit some of the dynamics of the 85% to 90% conversion in 2020 it seems the Canada payments are intact. So that's still about a $1 billion and what are other changes to working capital perhaps with either progress payments or inventories? Is it fair to assume that Gulfstream was may be $500 million or so of inventories in Q1 given you couldn’t deliver 11 aircrafts?
Jason Aiken: Sure. I think you’ve picked up on a number instantly on a number of the drivers here. The two $500 million payments on the Canadian program were inherent in our forecasts of those coming in is certainly welcome news to solidify that element of the outlook. When you think about the defense side of the business and some of the accelerated contract payments progress payment rates have moved from 80% to 90% and some other advance mechanisms we're seeing. As I mentioned most if not all of that is essentially flowing through to the supply chain. So that's really sort of a net pass when it comes to the outlook. So bottom line really when you think about the overall impact, it really is at Gulfstream and it's that portion of the production out or I should say the production rate down. When you think about it, we were expecting to start this year with sort of the inflection point on working through some of the inventory working capital at Gulfstream between the test airplane deliveries and getting 500 and 600 up to a more steady state production level with these production shifts that sort of pushes that out call it 6 to 12 months and so the inflection point on that working capital drawdown at Gulfstream will just push out some somewhat. So that's really the driver in the difference on the free cash flow conversion.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you and Chad thank you and everyone else for being on this call today. As a reminder please refer to the General Dynamics' website for the first quarter earnings release and highlights presentation which contains our summary outlook. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has not concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your line.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-29 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter 2019, Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Alyssa, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full-year 2019 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.
Phebe Novakovic:  Good morning and thank you, Howard. So, earlier today we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.77 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $1.02 billion and earnings of $3.51 per fully-diluted share. This 14% improvement in EPS against the fourth quarter of 2018 was a result in part of a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins. The quarter-over-quarter earnings improvement at Aerospace was a major driver of this result.  We enjoyed a very solid fourth quarter and a strong 2019. We achieved most of our operational and financial goals and added meaningfully to our backlog, in some cases rather dramatically. The results in comparisons with prior periods are straightforward and rather compelling. I'll go through them briefly, I'll leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments, our outlook for 2020 and your questions.  I also think you'll find the press release and the highlights chart on our website fulsome and helpful. As we had indicated at the start of the year, the final quarter was our strongest. Earnings per share at $3.51 beat consensus by $0.06, revenue and operating earnings were somewhat better, our provision for tax was lower offset somewhat by a higher share count and higher borrowing cost. So, all-in-all, a solid quarter with good performance compared to the year ago quarter as well as the third quarter of 2019. For the full-year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.98. Revenue of $39.35 billion was up over 2018 by $3.2 billion an increase at each of our reporting segments. Operating earnings of $4.6 billion were up $191 million or 4.3% over 2018. Earnings from continuing operations of $3.5 billion were up to $126 million or 3.8% over 2018. Importantly, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.76 above 2018. Our business was strengthened by significant growth in our backlog to a new high of $87 billion. A very strong order intake particularly in aerospace and marine, positions the company well for 2020 and beyond. Let me review the full-year and the quarters on a year-over-year basis without reference to sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we have significantly more revenue, higher operating earnings, higher earnings from continuing operations and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter of 2019. So, I'll discuss each group, provide some color where appropriate.
Jason Aiken: Thank you Phebe and good morning. I'm going to cover a number of topics to provide some color with respect to our 2019 results and some context for the 2020 guidance that Phebe will give you in just a few minutes. First is cash. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated just over $2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, reflecting approximately 200% of net income. That resulted in the cash conversion rate of 57% for the full-year, obviously lower than we were striving for. As you might infer from this result, we did not collect the outstanding arrears on our large international combat vehicle program before the end of the year.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. So, let me provide our operating forecast for 2020, initially by business group and then a companywide roll-up. In Aerospace, we expect 2020 revenue to be about $10 billion, without pre-owned sales up from 2019. Operating margin will be about 15.7% to 15.8%. Revenue will be much stronger in the second-half as well margin rate. Operating margin will accelerate through the year similar to 2019, starting in the 14% range and ending around 18% by the fourth quarter. We are seeing 5% revenue growth in 2020 in between $40 million to $45 million of improved earnings. In Combat, we expect revenues about $7.3 billion and approximately $300 million increase over 2019. We expect operating margins to be about 14.3%. Here again, look for both revenue earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year, with a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to seek a solid growth for the business with orders for the Abrams and solid demand for our Stryker vehicles ammunitions. Like last year, we see domestic volumes rising faster than our international business. Although a few international opportunities could tip that bound. The Marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately $9.85 billion, an increase of almost $700 million over 2019. Operating margin in 2020 is anticipated to be about 8.6%. We anticipate growth at each of our yards a long-term driver of growth here is the submarine work which is expanding exponentially. Our biggest opportunity in this group is to outperform the forecasted margin rate. We expect IT revenue of approximately $8.45 billion consistent with 2019. With margins in the 7.6% range, the results in a modest increase in operating earnings. We expect Mission Systems revenue in 2020 of about $5.1 billion, an increase of approximately $140 million. We anticipate operating margins about 14.1%, again building throughout the year. So, for 2020 companywide, we expect to see slightly more than $40.7 billion of revenue, up 4% over 2019, and operating margin of 11.9%. This all rolls to forecasted $12.55 to $12.60 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it did in 2019, with Q1 about $2.60, and progressively stronger quarters thereafter. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operation. It assumes a 17.5% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count constant with yearend figures, so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. I should leave you with this final thought, the near imminent resolution of our large international contract and attendant cash issues, including the current receipt of funds provides enormous clarity in the liability of funds. This coupled with our strong balance sheet, leaves us with greater flexibility for capital deployment than we've had in the recent past. We intend to utilize it to create value for our shareholders.
Jason Aiken: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up. So, Alyssa, would you please remind the participants how to enter the queue now, please?
Operator: Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session.  And the first question today comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi Ron. 
Ronald Epstein: Just following-up on your final comment there that you have more flexibility around capital deployment. That was a bit of a teaser. What are you thinking? I mean, what, buying back shares? I mean, what are you thinking about that?
Phebe Novakovic: So, we'll deal with our short term debt and then we will buy back shares appropriately.
Ronald Epstein: But, anything else? I mean, are you thinking about other things to do in the portfolio? Meaning, I mean, we've seen a flurry of M&A in the space. So I mean, is there anything --
Phebe Novakovic: We don't comment on M&A. Nice try, Ron.
Ronald Epstein: Okay. Alright. Alright, thank you, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning. 
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, David.
David Strauss: Phebe, on the Gulfstream, I guess, revenue forecast. Can you help us a bit maybe at a high-level in terms of some of the moving pieces there? What you're expecting for total aircraft deliveries kind of the ramp down on the 650?
Phebe Novakovic: So, we expect about 150 aircraft deliveries this year, and consistent with our expressed plan to you all sometime ago. We will ramp down the 650 deliveries as we increase the 500 and 600 deliveries. So, that mix and cadence around that mix is anticipating, is playing out as anticipated.
David Strauss: And do you expect more of the 650 ramp down to occur in '20 or '21? I think before you've been talking about more of that hit coming in '20 versus '21?
Phebe Novakovic: Largely in '20, but we will continue to ramp according to really the demand. We are ramping to a point where we have demand and delivery in an equilibrium, and I'm quite comfortable that we'll get there. But, it's pretty clear that it was very clear to me that in 2020, 650 deliveries will as anticipated decrease.
Operator: The next question today comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. 
Robert Stallard: Thank you so much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: On GDIT Phebe, it looks to me now the organic revenue growth has been a little bit below what some of the other peers in the industry been able to achieve, and that's why they continue in 2020. Now, is this a consequence of these award delays, or is it something to do with just the time it takes to integrate CSRA or something else? And when would you expect this revenue growth rate to pick up?
Phebe Novakovic: So, I was pretty explicit in my remarks around that, but just to reiterate. There were three fundamental factors. First, we experienced significant delays in the execution of awards. The velocity of execution slowed considerably, and the number of potential awards caught and this set of purgatory increased dramatically. Second, and don't forget this, we exited two lines of business last year. And third, we had several mature programs and we lost one or two recompetes, both of which reduced near-term volume that will be replaced over time by our new limbs. So think of this latter category as mix and timing.
Robert Stallard: So is it safe to say…
Phebe Novakovic: So, to your second question, we had anticipated 2019 from 2020 would show some growth, that growth has now moved to the right in 2021. And we're expecting mid-single digit growth, again driven by the execution and velocity of the contract awards.
Robert Stallard: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Thank you. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Doug. 
Doug Harned: Can you take us through a little bit on the Block V Virginia-class, because this is obviously a bigger boat, it's very important? What are the differences that you see between Block V and Block IV? And how should we expect that to flow through to financial performance over next several years?
Phebe Novakovic: So, you quite accurately point out the Block V represents a considerable increase in capability for the U.S. Navy, and a considerable increase in our workload, given that the addition of the new capabilities is executed entirely by us. And so, as we think about from Block IV to Block V, we continue to come down our learning curves. And we are sequencing all of these now builds around the first delivery of Columbia, which we’ll start work at the end of this year. So, I think that with respect to Block V, our job is simply to execute Block V effectively. And as I said in my remarks, the key here is just increasing our margin and really improving our ship over ship capabilities. So, we've got Block V in very good shape along with our Navy customer, and we've begun to work on it, and we will continue that execution for the next several years.
Doug Harned: And then you talked about the investment you're having to make for CapEx for both in Block V and Columbia class. But, when you think about the trajectory for that investment it's not just facilities but it's also labor. And when you look at planning for this, how do you see the trajectory for your costs and for reimbursement by the customers, you work to build up here?
Phebe Novakovic: So, let's take that in two fold. First, our customers well aware of the imperatives that we face. And they have worked closely with us to better match the investment with the return, which is wholesome for everyone. With respect to the essence, and now that your question ramping up on growth in our workforce, so we started this about eight years ago, working in public-private partnerships with Rhode Island and Connecticut to begin to trend the kinds of workers that we needed, and in large numbers. That coupled with our internal training program, we have demonstrated over the last four years. We have brought new shipbuilders into the yard at a higher initial capabilities. And then they continue to learn. So, the Navy has fully supported our efforts with respect to expanding our workforce and the need to bring training up into skills that frankly in this country have atrophied. When you think about plumbing and pipe fitting and electricians and welders, welders are critical and key capability. A number of those in the U.S. training programs throughout the United States had to had atrophied a bit. And in our world up in New England, we are rebuilding those at a very rapid rate. So, we're very comfortable that we can meet our expectations for growth.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much. So at one point, Phoebe, you were talking about the G500 and 600 coming down the learning curve, and becoming more profitable as we move out in time. And I think you suggested in 2021, directionally margin should be up as that plus ways the mix shift away from the 650. Is that still a trend that you look for?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, it's a trend that we look for and that we are experiencing. As you would expect from the operating discipline, and the price discipline and cost discipline that we have, we continue to see learning and nice learning on each and every one of these aircrafts coming down the line to offset the reduction in part, as offset the reduction in 650 deliveries. We have clearly articulated this plan several years ago and we've been right on sequence on it. So, I think there's nothing new there in terms of the strategy and the execution around that strategy.
Cai von Rumohr: Terrific. And then Jason, quickly for you. You talked of conversion going to 100% in 2021. Can you give us some color in terms of how much does pension contribution come down if at all? How much does CapEx come down? And what kind of a benefit do you get from inventory liquidation on the 500 and 600? Thanks.
Jason Aiken: Sure. So, when you think about the capital investment, I think, I said earlier, we had expected about 3% of sales in 2019, and ended up at about 2.5%. You should expect to see that in a similar range, call it 2.5% in 2020 because of the elements of that that we pushed to the right. That'll step down starting in 2021, so that by call it 2023, we will be back to the typical, more historic typical 2% range that we've been in. Pension contributions, on the other hand, as I mentioned, elevated $400 million plus in 2020. It will stay elevated for another year or so maybe a year and then come back down from there. So, a little bit of a surge in pension contribution and then returning back down to a lower level. And then, I think in terms of the working capital, the biggest single thing that you should expect is we ended the year with somewhere close to the neighborhood of $2.9 billion of unbilled receivables contracting process if you will, on the large international combat vehicle program. That will step down to the point that that working capital is essentially liquidated by the end of call it 2023. That along with the 500 and 600 as you mentioned those test articles will be sold here in 2020 and 2021, respectively. So, those will be a benefit. And as a result, the aggregate outcome of that as we expect to actually see free cash flow in '21 and beyond, call it 2021, '22 even '23, actually in excess of 100% of net income. So, we will start this recapture some of that shortfall that we've had over the past couple of years.
Operator: The next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joseph DeNardi : Hey, good morning. Phebe, if we go back four or five years, I think there was a debate as to how the Navy would afford Colombian and Virginia and they have decided to fill both simultaneously. When does that actually get locked in? Do you see any political risk to that that decision gets revisited whether to feather in a Colombian placement Virginia, or is that a risk going on at this point? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: So, think about long-term demand for a given product line as driven by the war fighter's needs. And with respect to classes of our submarines there is real war fighter demand on Virginia. And then on Columbia, that is a national program and it can't wait. So the nation sees the decision-makers in both the executive branch and on capital you will see the imperative to fund and wholesomely fund both of those programs. And as we sit here today, we see pretty good surety, very good surety on a going forward basis. The stability of that backlog and the reliability of increasing backlog in submarine for quite some time to come. Think about the submarine business, ship building in general, bur the submarine business in particular, as executing slowly over time relatively slowly over time given the complexity of building a nuclear submarine. That is offset in terms of predictability of backlog. These are very secure platforms, because they are in demand. They are in current demand and they will be in future demand, there are certain imperatives.
Operator: The next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak : Hi, good morning everyone.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Noah.
Noah Poponak : Phebe, I wondered if you could just expand on what you're seeing in the overall business chat in Gulfstream demand environment, because on the one hand some of the leading indicator data there has looked a little tougher, but obviously you've got your new product set and have the really strong bookings in the quarter. So just kind of curious to here we're seeing. And was the book-to-bill excluding the G700 also above one in the quarter?
Phebe Novakovic: So, the answer to your question, the latter question is yes. If you have been following us and you have for some time, you'll know that that our basic predicate for this business is that new product and truly new product, clean sheet airplanes all new drive demand. And that predicate is where now, not surprisingly, in my mind. So, our new products are generating demand and are expected new product in the 700 is generating demand. So, think about the experience of OEMs in this market as really idiosyncratic to the product offerings staff. So, our experience in this market is that we have enjoyed nice, steady demand year-over-year, that demanded is increased as the new products are announced and enter into service. And in addition, so much of selling airplanes is predictability of the delivery and reliability of the airplane and the ability to service. All of that drives demand and we are, I think, arguably, without questions, the best-in-class with respect to all of those key factors. So, we are quite comfortable with our positioning and the fourth quarter was good and the pipeline is active.
Noah Poponak : And then just on the margins in the segments. I think the company has said that the 2021 rate of expansion should be faster than the '20 rate of expansion, and I think you've even said getting back into the high-teens '21 maybe '22. Do I have that, right? Does that still hold in terms of the trajectory from here?
Phebe Novakovic: The trajectory does hold and will end this year in the high-teens margin. But then, so this is a complex business of lots of moving parts. So, margins tend to be somewhat variable quarter-over-quarter largely driven by mix. But again, the basic thesis around the introduction of these airplanes and the profitability and the realization of that profitability remains today, the same as it was.
Operator: The next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro : Yes, good morning. Maybe, it doesn't look like the 650 deliveries really came down much if anything in '19. So, are the declines in '20 reflecting just lower backlog in 650 today, than a year ago or what's really driving the 650 decline?
Phebe Novakovic: 650 backlog has not declined. We've seen a nice increase. Look, the deliveries quarter-over-quarter of these airplanes is often driven by customers. So we had, about three 600s that for various outside the United States regulatory issues, or delayed, we'll move into this delivery is expected for this quarter. And we have some 650s that customers wanted earlier, so we took a few of those. And we're able to execute and satisfy those customers' needs. So, 650 has done extremely well, not in significantly, as we talked about in this call and the third quarter. There are a lot of demand signals and demand catalysts for the 650. The introduction to 700 clarified it. And frankly, as we told you, what has increased 650 demand. So, by the way, this airplane, we've got 400 of them in service, and some of them are coming out of warranty and there's a natural replacement cycle. So, we continue to see nice demand for the 650.
George Shapiro : So why bring down the deliveries if the backlog is up, I must be missing something here?
Phebe Novakovic: Because, ultimately overtime you want to fully match the backlog with the deliveries. And if you recall, we entered this transition period with an extraordinarily long and I argued that time, a too long wait time. And we have equalized that wait time to order to wait time significantly during this transition period. And we'll get back to that regular cadence. But look, our 650 order book, and what we've got in backlog fully supports our going forward 650 production estimates. That's what you really want to see, if the order book is enough to satisfy your 650 deliveries.
Howard Rubel: Operator, this upcoming question will be our last.
Operator: The last question today comes from Seth Seifman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: Phebe, you mentioned in Marine Systems that there was opportunity in operating margin. Are there specific milestones that you would point to potentially coming up this year? And if so, what and when are they?
Phebe Novakovic : So, there are multiple milestones in any given year, and they are tied to exceedingly large number of internal milestones and milestones to our Navy customer. But that's not the only thing that drives. So, we will see some of those, as we always do in any given year. But really our ability to drive margins is all about the cost control and performance, and we continue to drive hard on both. This is a very high performance shipyard
Seth Seifman: Thank you very much.
Howard Rubel: Thank you very much. And thank you all for joining our call today.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-23 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.  After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Rocco, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Howard. And good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we delivered attractive third quarter results with revenue of $9.76 billion operating earnings of $1.216 billion and net earnings from continuing operations of $913 million. We reported EPS of $3.14 per diluted share, $0.25 a share, better than the year ago quarter and $0.37 per share, better than the second quarter of this year. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue was up $667 million or 7.3%. By the way, we have enjoyed top-line growth every quarter for the past 12 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. Earnings from continuing operations of $913 million were up $49 million or 5.7% on a 7.1% improvement in operating earnings, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and lower pension income. Operating margins return to the 12.5% level. Sequentially, revenue was up $206 million or 2.2% and operating earnings were up $126 million or 11.6% on higher operating margins. In short, we had significant sequential margin improvement. With respect to consensus, our margin rate was 40 basis points higher than forecasted by the South-side. This was offset in part by below the line items, leaving our EPS $0.07 better than consensus, the difference was provided by stronger operating earnings. With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $1,091 million and free cash flow of $847 million. As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a good quarter with a 1 to 1 book-to-bill. Total backlog of $67.4 billion, decreased $258 million or about a third of 1%. I have more to say about order intake if I discuss the separate operating segments and Jason will give you some color about cash and backlog in his remarks. Let me turn very briefly, the year-to-date 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. Revenue was up $2.8 billion or 10.7% against the first three quarters of 2018, driven by strong organic growth, plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. To say it another way for clarity, CSRA attributed revenue was in every 2018 quarter, but the first. Operating earnings were up $89 million or 2.8% EPS was $0.31 better. In short, we delivered good sequential improvement and a good first 9 months. As such, essentially, we are on track to our internal plan and external expectations. So let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and the year-to-date. First Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in most important respects. Revenue of $2.5 billion was 23% higher than the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $393 million were $17 million or 4.5% higher on lower margins related to mix as fully expected. Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning -- concerning earnings and operating margin. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a strong third quarter last year with 18.5% operating margin against 15.8% this quarter. This Delta is driven only in part by mix. The third quarter of 2018 contained a positive non-recurring settlement with the supplier. On a sequential basis, the story is even better revenue was up $359 million or 16.8% and earnings were up $62 million or 18.7% on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin; excluding pre-owned sales from both periods, results in a 70 basis point sequential improvement in Aerospace margin. The past quarter saw the first G600 deliveries and in the quarter. Over 30% of our large-cabin deliveries were comprised of new product which is notably higher than the second quarter 2019. So despite the challenges of mix, we are making good progress. We are focused on aligning our costs with our operating cadence.
Jason Aiken : Thank you Phebe and good morning. Our net interest expense in the third quarter was $114 million in both 2019 and 2018. That brings net interest expense to $350 million for the first 9 months of the year compared to $244 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in 2019 is due primarily to the debt we issued at the end of the first quarter of 2018 to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We've also been carrying a higher than anticipated commercial paper balance through the first 9 months as we continue to work to resolve an outstanding receivable balance on one of our large international vehicle programs, that's been outstanding since the fourth quarter of last year. As Phebe mentioned, our cash from operations in the quarter was $1.1 billion and our free cash flow was $847 million a 93% conversion rate. The cash performance in the quarter reflected some progress on the international receivables I just mentioned. That said, we still have work to do to resolve the balance of the arrears. We're continuing to work this issue with the customer and expect to have the matter resolved by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year we still expect full year free cash flow conversion to be well in excess of 100% of net income. Notwithstanding the progress made in the quarter, cash flow continued to be impacted by OWC growth at Gulfstream for reasons you now know and at Electric Boat. EB has been operating under an Un-definitive Contract Action or UCA, on the fifth Virginia-class Block, as we continue to work with the Navy to get that effort under contract. Until we get that contract executed our progress billings are temporarily limited.
Howard Rubel: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up question so that everyone has a chance to participate. Rocco, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.
Operator: . Today's first question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Good morning. Phebe, wanted to one, touch on the G700 and how that potentially impacts the prior guidance that you've given, with regard to Gulfstream where I believe you've talked about EBIT growing a little bit in '20, but then growing significantly in '21, and margins approaching the high double-digit range again. How is the G700 all factored into that?
Phebe Novakovic: So in -- no, because we expect the entry into service, several years out. But, but I think it might be opportune just to remind you guys how we're really thinking about the portfolio of our airplanes in our operating strategy. So, as you know, we've had a plan for the past several years to bring down the 650 production and increased 500 and 600 and we're doing that completely independently of the 700. We've been pretty voluble about the fact that G650 production and deliveries will be reduced next year and again the following year, so that will get production and delivery consistent with current demand. And on that score, we've had a very consistent order book for the 650 over the past three to four years. And as you know, we've had the benefit of a large backlog we've been able to work down over time. So listen, to be clear, this has nothing to do with the 700 launch announcement is a planned long ago. Our job is to balance the loss revenue and earnings from the planned reduction of G650 deliveries with an increased flow from 500 to 600 to keep earnings stable. If by the way, the state with that risk but it comes with ample opportunity, and as I said, this has been the consistent plan, and it remains our plan. And then as the G700 enters into service that will then become another factor in our long-range, in our earnings and revenue growth.
David Strauss: Okay. I guess just asking a different, different way the -- that prior guidance that you've given for Gulfstream for '20 and '21, does that still hold?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, I don't think we've given guidance per se, but we've indicated that we'll continue to grow our top line and our bottom line, as we've made that this making this transition. I think the bottom line will be a little , a little bit slower growth simply because we are managing that transition from the 650 to the 500 and 600 but look, our idea is to stabilize earnings with this, with this transition and we've done that and we'll continue to do that. So I think when you think about the business going forward, this is the strategy that has driven our behavior today and driving it and we'll drive that on a going forward basis so that will form how you're thinking about our performance going forward.
David Strauss: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yes, thanks good morning Phebe. Just a follow-up, just a question on the G700 you've always talked about the kind of dedicated production for the G500, G600 you started dedicated production facility with the G650. How should we think about that with the G700 is that going to be feathered in? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: Well, it won't necessarily be feathered in. But to your question about, do we have a dedicated production facility in line? We do! See to expect that type of learning that we've seen on our other platforms. On the 700 as we come down our learning curve increased production and come down our learning curve that's all post-driven by the result of both our operating efficiency as well as our dedicated line.
Peter Arment: And just as a follow-up related to that on the order front, I know you mentioned you expect healthy orders in the fourth quarter here, and you've had a book-to-bill over 1 for the 9 months year-to-date. How are you approaching the book to -- the bookings for the G700 is it following a similar path to the G500 and 600? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: Yeah, as I think you know, we've announced we've got a nice robust backlog for the 700, and as I said, our fourth quarter, we expect to have even better and improved order activity increased order activity across our portfolio. By the way, we had more orders this year as again this quarter as against the quarter, third quarter of 2018. But in our that's compared against a 23% increase in revenue. This is a good quarter for us.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you very much and Phebe congratulations on the G700 it looks terrific.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks Cai.
Cai von Rumohr: Okay. You've indicated, I guess, first delivery in 2022, given that you're fairly close to first flight. Any -- will your comment, is the hope to be in the earlier part of the year or the latter part of the year?
Phebe Novakovic: So look, we've, I think we're comfortable in the -- in the estimate of certification that we've given you. And we've looked through the prism as we thought about going forward, we look through the prism of the current regulatory environment, but you well know, even better than we do. And so we have factored that into our thinking. If that happens earlier that's great.
Cai von Rumohr: Got it. And then I guess some industry sources suggest that you had been showing this plan for some time under NDAs. Were there any firm orders included in your bookings in the third quarter for the G700.
Phebe Novakovic: We had some bookings on this airplane, that's all I'm going to say on that score. This airplane is going to be very popular with that particular market segment.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Jon Raviv of Citi. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: Hi, thanks very much. Bigger picture question, bigger picture question for you guys actually. Section on capital allocation decisions across the businesses certainly appreciate, Jason, that the focus through first half of '20 is on the payment of debt. Just sort of thinking about, how should we think about things going forward and how you make those allocation decisions across the businesses?
Jason Aiken: You know, John, I don't think we would really articulate any fundamental change to our long-standing approach to capital deployment as it as those priority stand internal investment first, where we have profitable opportunities for returns, followed by the steady and predictable dividend and then it really is about M&A were attractive accretive and in our core opportunities exist and share repurchase, but it and between that as you articulated for the moment the prioritization really is all about getting that debt pay down at least through the first half of next year. Once we get to that point, we'll roughly pay down half of the, the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition will have the commercial paper balance behind us and will have a chance to look forward. But I don't think in terms of prioritizing those various avenues for capital deployment anything on that score has changed for us.
Jon Raviv: Thank you. And then just a follow-up on GDIT perhaps Phebe you had mentioned that some of the dynamics are stretching out then is obviously a pretty heavy protest environment out there. Is there any thoughts about the acceleration previously pointed to heading into heading into next year in the context that peers generally doing mid-single digits, should we expect GDIT to take market share in that environment? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: So GDIT has been taking market share. I mean if you think about their performance, the performance to set underlying for underlies their outcomes since the acquisition. We've got a 75% --70%, 75% win rate for the trailing 12 months. I mean, that is consistent month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, and as you all know, the book-to-bills and 1.2, 1.1 to do you have different year-to-date. So look, we are, we are winning and more than our fair share, but we have seen a protraction. I mean that's a significant amount of money for our contracts be tied up in -- in protest at around $1 billion. Now protests as you all know historically resolved to the benefit of the winner, so we are quite comfortable that that historical precedents will remain. But we've also seen a slowing and the execution of the contract awards and we suspect that will resolve through the course of next year and our rate of growth will be in part and no small measure driven by the increased rate in award volume. So nothing is systemic here. It's really a question of timing.
Jon Raviv: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Myles Walton of UBS, please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks Howard. I'm just wondering Jason, maybe you can give is a little bit more color on the cash flow and in particular, the Canadian advance, was in the numbers this quarter, and also just give is a boundary condition, if you don't make further progress on the Saudi lab. How does that play into the 3.5 billion implied free cash flow for the first quarter?
Jason Aiken: Yes, sure. So, yes, in fact the advanced we received in the quarter is in the numbers that you've seen. So that's in the 90% conversion rate for the quarter. As it relates to the balance of the year, I think the way to think about it is we came into the year with just over $1 billion of arrears from the fourth quarter of last year. That's grown somewhat call it another half a billion dollars through the balance of this year and so that's what we're after right now that's what's currently outstanding. I think you can see in our disclosures, there is an un-billed total, un-billed investment somewhere in excess of $2 billion, $2.5 billion. But that's not necessarily what's factored in here. It's really between $1.5 billion that we're still working to resolve before the end of the year.
Myles Walton: Okay and Phebe that marine margin I think is the best in a number of years. Just curious, is there anything one time and I know you didn't update the full-year projection, but let me just give us a little color to start of the year. I think you said that's the segment that had the most upside opportunity. And does this is this that coming through?
Phebe Novakovic: So what you saw here was the strong and successful finish of Block 3. I mean Block 3 is largely done and that performance and the strong closing of that contract, really drove our margins, but as you all know margins in this business in particular Electric Boat have followed the same path for 18 years. We start a new block and because of the contract structure with our customer they receive some of the benefits of our prior improvements on the previous block and then we reset the bar and come back down our learning curves and that's where we really are on Block IV. But Block III is largely behind us and they -- and they've closed out very well.
Myles Walton: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hi, good morning everyone. I know I just coming back to the Gulfstream margins. I want to try to ask a question about the progression there because I know there's a lot of investor focus on it. First, please just further the last quarter of the year. If I take the guidance that you had previously provided. Literally, it would imply, it's down sequentially in the fourth quarter. So you're expecting that. And then I had interpreted prior comments to suggest expansion but modest expansion in 2020 because you're feathering 650 lower and you're still early in the 500, 600 ramp. But then, a larger degree of expansion in '21 as you further along in both of those processes. Do I have that correct?
Phebe Novakovic: So look, as you would imagine for a. for a business that has demonstrated the curve operating leverage year in year out on older models, the newer models Gulfstream will continue to march on margin improvement on a going forward basis. Don't forget that pre-own carries no margin. So to the extent that you've got a -- an implied lower margin in the fourth quarter, that's almost entirely reflected by by the pre-owned. As you well know just has no margin and is included in revenue, so there you have it.
Noah Poponak: And am I directionally correct on the beyond 2019 comments?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, I think we've been pretty consistent all along that this business is going to get better and better over time. That's about what we're going to say at this juncture.
Noah Poponak: And the will the G700 be the highest margin airplane in the portfolio, once it's at full-rate production?
Phebe Novakovic: We are so not going there. So look, you can imagine that we do well on our airplanes because we don't compete on price and we have a, unerring commitment to cost reduction and cost optimization, every quarter, every month, every quarter we get better.
Operator: And our next question today comes from George Shapiro Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, George.
George Shapiro: Hi, your comment about the Q4 margin being lower from higher preowned. I mean, this quarter, it looks like there was for pre-owned for about $90 million. So you have would have earned 16.3% margin on the zero for the pre-own. Are you suggesting the fourth quarter is going to have higher pre-owned and I would have thought we're kind of through the G500 block. So that the fourth quarter margin would still be above the third quarter?
Jason Aiken: So, George taking your premises in reverse order, you're right about the progression on the underlying manufacturing improvements and I think that's what Phebe was alluding to earlier, we'll continue to see that progress quarter-on-quarter for Gulfstream. But yes, it's your first premise, based on the inputs we're seeing right now and the contracts that will deliver in the fourth quarter, we would expect to see at this point more pre-owned aircraft sales in the fourth quarter.
George Shapiro: And Jason that will more than offset the fact that the 500 through its initial block. So the margin should step up some in the fourth quarter?
Jason Aiken: I mean, I don't know that I want to piecemeal it down to that level. Those are two of the many inputs that go into the margins at Gulfstream in any quarter, when we've talked about this many times in the past. There is varying R&D levels, there's different mix of aircraft deliveries in all the different inputs the Jet Aviation service margins and so on. So I think we've articulated a couple of those discrete ones that are clear at this point, but the implied fourth quarter there is a couple of people who are picking up on is, as usual, a blend of a whole myriad of factors. So I think the most important point here for the long-term investor is the steady regular improvement in the operating cadence and margin of the production of the airplanes at Gulfstream.
George Shapiro: And just a clarification for you, Jason. The advance you got this quarter for -- from Canada. Was that just for the new Canadian contract or was there also some from the Saudi receivable?
Jason Aiken: That is strictly related to our relationship with the Canadians. On the new program.
George Shapiro: On the new program. Okay. So when you commented in the third quarter you expected to get some cash in August and in the balance by the end of the year, you were really just referring to this new contract, which obviously hadn't been announced at that point?
Phebe Novakovic: Well that's set we had anticipated that we would get this contract award and there would be an attendant along with that. That is one separate and distinct issue. As you all know, our international, the payments on our international program out of Canada have remained slow. Let me just remind everybody, there is no dispute on quantum, there no dispute on the fact that it is owed. It's simply a question of timing and we are still hopeful that we resolve that by the end of the year, but two distinct elements. Okay?
Operator: Our next question today comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Hunter Keay: Hey, good morning everybody. Thank you. You've sort of touched this little bit Phebe but can you elaborate on the comment you made, when you said the G700 has stimulated G650 discussions what you mean by that. And then the second part and I'm done here is, any thoughts on the tariff situation in Europe. Have you heard any concerns from your customer looks like this are going to be exempt, but any any rumblings about that over there? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: So an inverse order, none on the tariffs and in fact ex-US business continues to be very fulsome. But let's talk a bit about the 700 and frankly the introduction of the 700 clarifies the 650 and let me give you a little bit of an explanation on why and talk to you about what the 700 is and what it is not. The G700 is in a slightly different market space, but in the same market segment as the 650. It is not a competitor. It is an alternative. It is not a replacement for the 650. Customers very clearly understand that and their buying decisions are motivated by a host of factors idiosyncratic and individual factors including the missions they fly, the ramp size, the makeup of the rest of their fleet. So I think it has clearly an ARM in our experience the 700 is clarified the 650 and been helpful.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: And Rocco this is Mr. Rubel -- This will be our last question.
Operator: Thank you, sir.
Robert Spingarn: So Phebe, I wanted to go to GDIT and just talk about the margin progression. You talked about some of the expenses in the quarter a pressure on the margins in the quarter, but otherwise would be higher. If we go back to your prior guide, I think that indicates a pretty robust fourth quarter, so could we talk about that and what normalized margins look like? And then just for a follow-up. Jason, I hear you on the cash deployment and retiring the debt, but given interest rates might it not make sense to look at the share buyback here just doing the math? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: But we're comfortable with our leverage and we're going to pay down that debt and we historically have never taken out debt to buy stock. So all sorts of reasons but we have discussed over the years. But look, GDIT margins were consistent with what we anticipated minus this one-time charge as we exited a line of business that we have inherited with CSRA. I don't think I need to remind you because I know you understand this that -- their EBITDA margins are industry-leading so their margin performance will continue to improve.
Howard Rubel: This is Mr. Rubel. Thank you very much for the call today and thank you everybody else for joining us. As a reminder, you should refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release and the highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you sir. Today's conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics’ Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2019 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone. As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $9.56 billion and net earnings of $806 million. We reported EPS at $2.77 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.09 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue was up $369 million or 4%. This is as reported, but organic growth was higher after taking into account the effect of divestitures at GDIT and the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. Remember that divestitures at GDIT provided some of more than $250 million per quarter in revenue. Net earnings of $806 million were up $20 million or 2.5% on a modest improvement of operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by higher interest expense. Sequentially, revenue was up $294 million or 3.2% and operating earnings were up $76 million or 7.5% on higher operating margins. With respect to consensus, revenue in the quarter was about $200 million more and the operating margin rate was 10 basis points higher than forecasted by the sell side. In short, $0.08 of the $0.09 beat was provided by stronger operating earnings. Let me turn very briefly to the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Revenue was up $2.1 billion or 12.5% against the first half of 2018 driven by strong organic growth plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. In other words, CSRA revenue was not reflected in the first quarter's results last year. On the other hand, operating earnings were up only $8 million, burdened by the amortization related to the CSRA acquisition. EPS was $0.06 better. In short, we had a very good second quarter, good sequential improvement, and a good first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal operating plan and external expectations. So, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then ask Jason for some comments before I give you some insight into our outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $119 million versus $103 million in the second quarter of 2018. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $236 million versus $130 million for the same period last year. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We're also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments related to one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. At this point we expect the interest expense for 2019 to be approximately $460 million. Our cash from operations of $291 million in the quarter was also impacted by these payment delays. As we've discussed previously this is a timing item. With respect to the outstanding receivable balance, we were recently told by the customer that we will receive considerable funding next month. We continue to expect to resolve the balance of the arrears by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year, we still expect full year free cash flow conversion will be well in excess of 100% of net income. On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures were $181 million in the quarter or approximately 2% of revenues. Assuming receipt of the outstanding payments I just noted consistent with the timing I described, we still expect our capital expenditures to reach approximately 3% of revenues for the year, reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, bringing the rate for the first half to 18.3% consistent with our expectations for the full year. In the quarter, we paid $295 million in dividends and we spent approximately $100 million on the repurchase of 575,000 of our shares. That brings the total for the first half to 1.1 million shares for $184 million. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercised employee stock options. Otherwise we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $702 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $13.2 billion. We expect to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year and our first tranche of fixed and floating rate notes matures in the second quarter of next year. I'll wrap up with a few points of color on the backlog and our order activity in the quarter. We had another solid quarter with respect to orders. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $67.7 billion. That's up 2% over this time a year ago and the total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $102 billion, up 3% over a year ago. As Phebe mentioned, GDIT posted a particularly strong quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.24 times and I'll remind you that, that does not include over $2.5 billion in IDIQ awards in the quarter which as you know we don't include in backlog or our book-to-bill calculations.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks Jason. So, turning to our outlook for the year. Let me provide our forecasts for the year for each segment compared to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $9.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from 2018; operating earnings around $1.5 billion; and an operating margin around 15.5%. We now expect revenue of $9.95 billion with earnings of $1.525 billion with an operating margin of 15.3%. The increased revenue comes largely from increased preowned sales and modest mix shift. Earnings will be up on improved operating performance, but the margin rate will be diluted by preowned aircraft sales. For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion, up $260 million to $360 million from 2018 with operating earnings in the range of $965 million to $975 million. We now expect revenue of $6.8 billion and operating earnings of approximately $1 billion. The more revenues drives $25 million to $35 million and more operating earnings. For the Marine Group, we've previously guided to our revenue of $9 billion, margins of around 8.5%, and operating earnings of $770 million. We see no reason to change that guidance, although my bias would be very nominally lower. For Mission Systems, we've previously provided an outlook for this year of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion with margins in the mid to high 13% range. This implied an operating earnings of around $660 million. We now anticipate revenue of $5 billion, operating earnings around $690 million, with operating margins of around 13.8%. For Information Technology, we guided to revenue of $8.3 billion with an operating margin of 7.5%. We now expect revenue of $8.5 billion and operating earnings of $630 million, with an operating margin of 7.4%, 10 basis points lower. So all of this sums to revenues for General Dynamics of about $39.2 billion and operating earnings of around $4.6 billion. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have both higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $11.60 to $11.70 to a range of $11.85 to $11.90. As for the quarterly progression, it appears to us that the third quarter will be $0.30 better than the second quarter. Howard, we can now take some questions.
Howard Rubel: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up. So, that everyone has a chance to participate. Rocco, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator:  Today’s first question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Phebe the Aerospace division, one of your peers noted that their customers took a bit of a strike in May and June with concerns over the economy and tariffs and I was wondering if you saw anything like that at Gulfstream?
Phebe Novakovic: No.
Robert Stallard: That was pretty straightforward.
Phebe Novakovic: Look we have continued to have nice order activity. Our pipeline remains robust. As I think I have explained to many of you before, you need to look at the business aviation market, not only by cabin size but really by OEM because our experience in the marketplace is very different from others. So we continue to have good order activity throughout each of the months in the quarter.
Robert Stallard: That’s great. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein: Yeah, good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Ron.
Ronald Epstein: Just to follow on to Rob's question. I mean, can you kind of walk through the demand environment you're seeing across the different products you have at Gulfstream 650, 600, 500, 280?
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. So the 650 continues to have very solid demand. I think by the end of this quarter we had 370 in service. It continues to have performance characteristics unmatched by anyone else any other aircraft and it continues to enjoy some very nice solid demand. The 600 has had very good demand. We suspect as we saw that the 500 when we start delivering these airplanes that is the catalyst for incremental demand increases and I have every confidence that that will also increase. 500 continues nicely and the 280 has had good sales but a little bit more episodic that end of the market tends to be that way. But on our big key platforms, airplanes, we’ve continued to have good activity.
Ronald Epstein: And then as a follow-on question, have you seen any blowback in the Chinese market regarding the potential sale of Abrams to Taiwan? Because there were some stuff in the Chinese press about it. I'm not sure if it's just kind of press noise or if there's some reality there?
Phebe Novakovic: As far as I know, no tank sales have actually occurred. But let me remind everyone how this works. This is an FMS case or any FMS case. The U.S. Army buys our tanks and sells them to other foreign nations in this case potentially Taiwan. I'd say that that we've had fairly muted demand in that market for a while now, and I suspect that tariffs have had some dampening effect but the pipeline is increasingly active and we've been quite comfortable on where we are.
Ronald Epstein: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, David.
David Strauss: Hey. Phebe, so on the G500 it looks like deliveries in the quarter based on the 21 that you said have been delivered so far. It looks like deliveries were pretty light in the quarter on G500. Maybe I expected the margin to be better because of that. Can you just talk about that and if you’re through the first block that's below margin G500 deliveries at this point?
Phebe Novakovic: So, we had a bit of catch-up in Q1 right after the -- after the 2018 certification. And frankly this is simply a timing issue and we are continuing to come down our learning curves. Our margin performance is better on each and every airplane that comes down -- and down our line. So, this is simply in the moment a timing issue that we had a bit of a backlog in Q1 and we're through that and we're entering into really steady state.
David Strauss: Okay. And then for my follow-up, on GDIT, it looks like based on your updated guidance, you're still expecting organically ex the divestitures relatively flat in the second half of the year. When do we start to see this strong booking rate that you've highlighted come through in terms of actual organic growth of that business? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: By 2020, as we said before this is in a transition year for us and a positioning for growth year and all of the indicators of growth are there. So, we are pretty confident that next year is going to realize some of those that increased backlog.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hello, thanks very much and good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Morning.
Seth Seifman: I just want to ask a little bit about the cadence of EPS not that it matters that much, I mean the guidance is out, but just in terms of what you had thought in January has kind of a very heavy fourth quarter and it seems like the EPS that had been in the second half cadence back in January, did some of that show up in the first half?
Phebe Novakovic: Somewhat, but our guidance is really -- so you think about it. The real story undergirding the update in the guidance is we've got more revenue with similar margin performance leading to higher earnings. So, when we give you our update mid-year, we guided the result of careful ops reviews and we have very considered guidance that looks at all -- and considers all the risk and opportunities and we tend to narrow our range and have a certain amount of precision, but I'd say the overarching story is more revenue higher earnings.
Seth Seifman: Okay, great. And just in Combat, in terms of if there were kind of specific platforms that drove the increase in the guide and, kind of, was there a meaningful amount of FX that you had to offset on the P&L just to be able to raise the guide by that $30 million?
Phebe Novakovic: Not on the P&L with respect to FX. This is simply continuing to come down our learning curves on the domestic programs that we now have and are increasing and then it's the velocity of the domestic program vehicles as we increase our manufacturing capacity. So that's really the undergirding. It's all a story about domestic right now in the U.S. Army.
Seth Seifman: Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everyone. 
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Jason on the free cash flow, I was wondering if it's maybe kind of worthwhile to bridge from this year to next year just on the bigger pieces just because I think I heard you say the Canadian labs payments coming in the back half of this year take you to 100% free cash to net income conversion this year, so it would imply still below 100% conversion without those payments assuming -- I know CapEx is still albeit, I'm assuming there's other working capital happen. So can we kind of -- can you help us bridge 2019 to 2020? Or is it actually just as simple as it starts clipping 100% conversion pretty clean beyond this year?
Jason Aiken: Yeah, I think if you isolate to catching up on the arrears on the international program this year, we had previously indicated and still are of the position that this year and frankly the years looking forward are in the 95 -- 90%, 95%, 100% conversion range on a pretty steady basis, fluctuating in that range based on CapEx investments and things like that. So really this one timing item and the resolution of that item is what causes the anomaly, it caused the anomaly last year. And I think to put a little bit more precision on the outlook for this year is if we get fully caught up this year, we would expect to be nicely in excess of 100%. So I think that may be reconciles a little bit of the math you were thinking about. But to your point beyond this year we're really -- we expect to be consistently in the range of 90% to 100% conversion year-on-year subject to some fluctuations with CapEx and other investments like that.
Noah Poponak: Got it. And then Phebe just going back to Gulfstream, can you speak to what pricing has been like in your recent order activity, better, worse or the same and what that means for margin improvement in the business going forward?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, as you can imagine, we're very sensitive about discussing pricing, but you can well imagine that we continue to enjoy the pricing that we've seen recently in our business and on each of our platforms.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yeah thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi.
Jason Aiken: Good morning.
Peter Arment: Phebe on GDIT, it sounds – it’s great, it sounds like the integration is tracking ahead of your planning and given that we're seeing the 1.2 book-to-bill you saw this quarter, do you characterize this as kind of -- you're picking up share gains? Or is it just the environment with all the spending? Just maybe some color on what you're seeing there? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So for those of you who have known us for a while, we never track share. That can be a fool’s errand. You can have an awful lot of share and go broke. So what we're really looking for is how we have built our pipeline; our win rates, which since the acquisition have been about 75 -- 74% to 75% on recompetes about 90% very strong at least 1:1 book-to-bill since the acquisition and we've been building -- we've been building that backlog with programs that we think we can execute quite effectively and quite efficiently. Let's talk a little bit about what GDIT is. You know, this is a people business and the way you attract people is by establishing a superior culture with very clear career development opportunities and some very interesting work. We have done quite well on that side in my mind and that I think undergirds this really quite impressive performance that this management team has exhibited since the acquisition. And again, just to give you a size and scope and complexity of this business, you know, on the first half we submitted almost $24 billion in proposals and that was more than the entire submittals in 2018. And for the remainder of the year and the second half we're looking at about $27 billion proposals. We submitted about 350 proposals just in terms of numerically in the second quarter and then -- and about 560 -- or 650 in the first half. So that tells you that what you need to undergird that kind of execution in proposals and velocity in submittals. And the win -- and the resultant win rate you need a very, very strong management team undergirded by the culture and the people that I've just talked about. And I'm very pleased with where we are right now. We are doing very well with GDIT. 
Peter Arment: Appreciate all the color. Thanks, Phebe.
Operator: And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Cai Von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much. So Phebe, could you give us some color in terms of the lead times at Gulfstream particularly for the G650 and 280? 
Phebe Novakovic: So as we've been transitioning to new aircraft we're no longer following individual plane lead times. But let me tell you all of our wait times are comfortably within the range of 1 year to 18 months and that's across our portfolio. So I'm good with that. I think that's the way you think about it and we have continued to perform quite nicely and hit our -- hit comfortable lead times in each of our legacy airplanes as well as our new ones. So we're really just managing to the orders and the demand. And we did well I think.
Cai Von Rumohr: Okay. Terrific. Great. Thank you. And then at GDIT you've given us the bid submits. Can you tell us at mid-year how much of -- what's the number for bids awaiting decision over the remainder of the year? And maybe give us some color some of the potential pursuits like GSMO and next gen?
Phebe Novakovic: So I don't actually know the timing and award decisions, given all the input that is really idiosyncratic to the individual customer, but I think one of the reasons I wanted to share with you the velocity of contracts and the enormity of the velocity of proposals and the enormity of the proposals, to give you a sense that we do not track and I don't think about this business in terms of any particular pursuits. And many of the pursuits you happen to mention are in our competitive space, so we’re certainly not going to talk about that. But I think that both the size and velocity of the submissions give you a real sense of this is a big business with a lot of moving parts. And frankly I don't worry about any one particular program.
Cai Von Rumohr: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Please go ahead.
Phebe Novakovic: Myles?
Operator: Hello, Myles, your line is open.
Myles Walton: Sorry about that. Good morning. Jason I was wondering if you could first maybe clarify on the payment you expected next month or just give a rough size of the burden at hand you have there. Would you get to full conversion for the year if that one came through?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, I think -- listen these are very -- I think we said all we're going to say about where we are right now on that program. As you can well imagine these are sensitive tripartite conversations and we've told you where, we're making nice progress and let's just leave it at that.
Myles Walton: Okay. Maybe a follow-up then.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, go ahead.
Myles Walton: The Marine Group, Phebe, you mentioned on the Marine Group that you weren’t changing the guidance that your bias was nominally lower, I just wanted to clarify was that lower on the margin or on the topline?
Phebe Novakovic: I think I said very -- nominally lower. So, listen I am in a big business that has a number of moving parts. I'm very sensitive particularly when we have new starts and we have a number of new starts, primarily at our West Coast shipyard and that plus we may see depending on the Navy needs, we may see additional material come in this year and that tends to carry a lower margin. So, I'm just at the absolute -- let's say very nominally I want -- condition that there's two things that we don't have as much clarity about as we typically do in any given quarter and so that's why I gave you that -- ever so-mild caveat.
Myles Walton: Yes, I know. I was just clarifying because it looked like revenue was running ahead, so that makes sense on the margin. Thanks Phebe.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Pete Skibitski of Alembic Global. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning guys. Phebe what's your view as you look at this two-year budget deal that's kind of shaped up this week for 2021. How do you think about the Navy’s ability to afford the Columbia class or for the potential for that program to crowd out other ship priorities or other programs for – if we are going to go into a flattening, kind of, environment?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, it’s certainly very good news that it looks like we've got some clarity in our political landscape at the moment. Listen, let's talk about Columbia for a moment. Columbia is a national priority and I have no doubt that as a national priority funding will be made available for it. There are a lot of different ways to do that from a budget perspective and I think that the U.S. Congress and our customer is talking about various avenues of ways to ensure healthy budgeting. I'll tell you back when we did the Ohio in the 80s a separate account was set up. That's a potential option. So I don't worry too much about Columbia crowding other programs out. There is an imperative for the Navy to recapitalize its ships and build more ships. There is a consensus in Washington across political spectrum, at least political parties -- leadership in the major political parties that understand that we need ships and we need to replace the under seed light of the deterrent. And So I'm comfortable that the Department of Defense working with the Congress will find appropriate funding mechanisms to address what you have raised. 
Pete Skibitski: Got it. Just as a follow-up what's the reason behind the -- at a higher pre-owned volumes this year at Gulfstream? Is that --- just a really active market? Or maybe this year is just an anomaly in terms of initial 600 customers or something like that? 
Phebe Novakovic: There is nothing in particular. On occasion we'll have a bit more pre-owned but it signifies nothing. 
Pete Skibitski: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Carter.
Jason Aiken: Good morning. 
Carter Copeland: Just a quick clarification and question. I had in my notes that Maximus was like a $900 million impact on the organic calculation, but I think you said 250 plus. Phebe, I just wondered if you would clarify that for us. And then just wondering now that you've gotten certification at Aerospace on the two new airplanes if you expect -- R&D to be a little bit more stable I know you had a comparison in the quarter that caused a little bit year-over-year variability, but should we expect that to be a little bit more steady in the future than we've seen in the last several quarters? 
Phebe Novakovic: So me -- let's answer that in inverse order. As we move the test airplanes from the test program in the customer set you'll see some reduction in R&D. And then as you all know we keep a nice level loaded amount of R&D in our business. We think that that's appropriate and so I think we'll see some decline. But we continue to have an active R&D -- series of active R&D activities in that -- in Gulfstream. 
Jason Aiken: And then Carter on the first half of your question, I think, your inference was correct on the scale of the business that we divested to Maximus. There were however in the last 12 months or so a couple of other smaller divestitures we did in the IT portfolio. We had a small commercial health care divestiture. We had a next-generation 911 supportive business. When you add all those up the total annualized revenues were somewhere slightly in excess of $1 billion so that was to Phebe's point, a roughly $250 million a quarter impact. 
Carter Copeland: Okay. That’s great. Thanks for the clarification.
Howard Rubel: And Rocco this will be our last question coming up now please.
Operator: Absolutely. Our final question today comes from Jonathan Raviv of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Raviv: Hey, thank you for the timing. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Jonathan Raviv: Phebe in terms of supporting that GDIT ramp into 2020, can you give us some color on how the personal recruiting site is going? I know it's a very important part of the people business.
Phebe Novakovic: So those management teams have gelled. We took leaders from both legacy businesses and they have really gelled into one team one fight throughout the first three quarters and during this acquisition and integration we have kept almost every single key leader that we wanted to keep, I believe every leader we wanted to keep. And we are reducing our staff turnovers. So all of that to me is very wholesome sign that we are building a cohesive team that is -- at GDIT up and down their leadership chain that can maintain a very long-term robust and successful business. I'm very pleased with what I've seen there both in terms of the energy level, the cohesion and the culture that they have established, it's really quite impressive.
Jonathan Raviv: Great, thanks. And then just thinking about that pickup. I mean, some peers in the market tend to talk about mid single digit organic growth. I know market share is not as important to you guys, but is that how we should think about the potential and should EBITDA growth accelerate in line with sales growth in 2020?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, I think we're growing about 3% this year and we'll see some nice growth in 2020. But beyond that we're not going to piecemeal 2020 at this point. We'll give you our 2020 estimate and outlook and detailed view of the business as we always do in the fourth quarter call after our fall review where we do in-depth analyses and bottom up operations reviews of each one of our businesses and we'll let you know then. Fair enough?
Jonathan Raviv: That’s right. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: You did. Thank you.
Howard Rubel: And thank you for joining our call today. As a reminder please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and highlights presentation, which will now contain our earnings outlook to the balance of the year. If you have any additional questions I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you very much.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the General Dynamics' First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' first quarter 2019 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10-K and 10-Q filings.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks Howard and good morning all. Earlier today we reported earnings of $2.56 per diluted share and revenue just shy of $9.3 billion. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net income of $745 million. Revenue was up 23% against the first quarter of 2018 due in large part to the acquisition of CSRA However, without CSRA revenue was up an impressive 9.6% on a purely organic basis. In fact, there was organic revenue growth across all five operating segments.  EPS of $2.56 was $0.14 better than consensus, it would appear that revenue was some $400 million higher than anticipated by the sell - side and operating earnings were up about $40 million higher. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion were just ahead of the year-ago result despite modest declines at aerospace, marine and combat systems. The result benefited from the combination of CSRA with GDIT.  The operating margin of 10.9% in the quarter was good, it did not compare favorably last year's stellar first quarter of 13.4% which was before the inclusion of amortization from CSRA transaction.  Net earnings were down $54 million over the same quarter in 2018. Higher interest expense, somewhat higher taxes were the cause of lower net income. It follows that earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.09 below the first quarter 2018, a 3% drop. Apart from the impressive revenue growth, an important part of the story in the quarter was order intake and growth in backlog. Total backlog grew to $69.2 billion, an increase of $1.34 billion compared to the end of last year.  Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the book-to-bill for the company was an impressive 1.2. Broken down into 1.1 to 1 for defense and 1.4 to 1 for aerospace. So let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.2 billion was $450 million, or 22.7% ahead of the year ago period. This is attributable in large part to the delivery of seven G500 in the quarter and a solid increase in service revenue. The moderately lower operating earnings were related to the mix shift at Gulfstream from the delivery of the G500. These planes carry the burden of the test program and retrofits as we previously advised. Margins on the aircraft will improve markedly through the year. At year-end, we had indicated that aerospace margins for the first two quarters would be in the mid 14% range, up somewhat from the 14.1% rate in the final period of 2018.
Jason Aiken: Thank you. Phebe and good morning. Net interest expense in the quarter was $117 million versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We're also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments on one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. Our free cash flow of negative $976 million was impacted by the payment delays and as we've discussed previously, this is a timing item. On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures of $181 million in the quarter were up about 75% from the year ago quarter as we invest in our shipyards to support the significant growth that is on the horizon. We still expect this year to be the peak at approximately 3% of revenues and returning to the 2% range thereafter. In the quarter, we paid $268 million in dividends and we spent $86 million on the repurchase of 525,000 of our shares. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercise of employee stock options. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $673 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.9 billion. Our effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, which is consistent with our full year tax rate guidance. As Phebe noted, order activity and backlog were particularly strong story in the quarter, as four of our five segments posted a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 or greater, even as we grew almost 10% organically. On that note, I think it bears a reminder that not all companies report book-to-bill on the same basis. We calculate this measure based on the firm backlog as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles excluding the value associated with IDIQ contracts. That's of course most relevant to Mission Systems in GDIT, each of which had a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 or greater, even under the more conservative GAAP definition.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Jamie, would you please remind participants, how to enter the queue.
Operator:  Our first question today comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
DougHarned: Yes, good morning, thanks. Hi, I wanted to -- if we get a little better understanding on the margin trajectory at Gulfstream, you talked before in the last quarter about the lower margins to beginning of the year and likely very attractive margins when you get out to Q4. Could you give us a sense of what's behind that trajectory and are those higher margins at the end of the year? Are those the sort of normal margins that we might expect going forward beyond this year?
PhebeNovakovic: And as I said in my remarks, the margin rate is largely attributable to the mix and as we've talked about fairly frequently, that mix is driven by the increased deliveries on the G500, which carry lower margin in that first accounting lot, but we're going to be through that in the second quarter. And look, I think we've been pretty, quite transparent about this change in mix. We'll work our ways through it, as we deliver more G500s and the G600s will enter into service all with good margin. So when I think about it, our margins will improve throughout the year and as we go into next year our performance will get even better and better. As yet -- we hit full-rate production on the G500 and G600 and continue to come down our learning curves.
DougHarned: And then when you get out there in the G500 and G600 are mature, is it possible to give us a sense of how you might think about that between for the G550 mature margins and G650 mature margins? Where were the G500 and G600 shakeout?
PhebeNovakovic: Well, the G650, nothing's going to come close to that for I think all the reasons you understand. But it is our expectation that the G500 and G600 surpass the G450 and G550 peak margins. They are built and purpose-built facilities that are coming down, straight line and we have over that time continued to perfect our manufacturing processes. So I -- when we are up, we're really, really running. I think we're going to be better than those two legacy airplanes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question.
RobertStallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe, just to start off with Aerospace. You noted the good demand for the G650 in the quarter. Are you still going to stick with your plan to gradually ease G650 deliveries over time?
PhebeNovakovic: Yes. So a little bit this year, and then more in next year and the following year when G500s and G600s are in -- as I say, full-rate production with good margins.
RobertStallard: Okay. And then as a follow-up on GDIT, you noted a good book-to-bill in the quarter. How sustainable do you think this is? And what's the expected conversion of that book-to-bill to revenues over time?
PhebeNovakovic: Well, when we put something in firm backlog, it's pretty sure conversion into revenue. But let me give you a little bit of context to it. I think it helps to understand. So GDIT in the quarter at 1.1 to 1 book-to-bill and over the last four quarters as I mentioned in my remarks they add 1 to 1. Now their win rate, they have demonstrated a win rate consecutively over those last four quarters between 70% and 75%. Against Dow's performance indicator, you've got a budget that is growing by 5%. So, I think this business is in very good stead for continued growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
RonaldEpstein: Hey. Good morning. Maybe a bigger, excuse me, a bigger strategic question. How are you thinking about Mission Systems? Right. I mean, their performance in the quarter was pretty good. And how do you think about growing that or it seems like it's sub-scale right now, right. Do you grow it? Do you sell it? What do you do with it, I mean, when you think about it?
PhebeNovakovic: So, given its portfolio, I don't believe that it's sub-scale. If you think about what they really are is, they are systems integrators with a significant products business. They've got some long-term franchise programs, a number of them and those programs are growing. So I like where they are, they've got some unique positioning, in fact, best-of-class position in a number of areas, in network security, cyber protection, accuracy and position, navigation in a GPS environment, integration of systems on the ballistic missile class submarines and the fire control system. So they assist something. These are programs that they've had for a long, long time, all of which are on the growth trajectories. So, I don't really see them as sub-scale. And again, their margins are really quite nice. This is a good operating leverage company. I think they play nicely in the space therein, and we're quite comfortable with this.
RonaldEpstein: Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-on in Aerospace. Can you say when is the next available delivery slot for G650?
PhebeNovakovic: Yes, I'm not getting into that anymore, so we're really not tracking it that way. We've got a whole lot of new airplanes coming on. So those individual metrics become little less meaningful, but you need to think about what's really unusual and unique about the Gulfstream portfolio, as we have a family now of all brand new airplanes and when I say brand new, they are clean sheet, you know that better than anybody what that means, from scratch all new, nobody else has that, and that family is compelling, and we're seeing that in our consistent demand.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead with your question.
GeorgeShapiro: Yes, good morning. On the Gulfstream, Phebe, are we seeing the trend for orders continue were strong in the second quarter here?
PhebeNovakovic: So we're off to a good start, but undergirding this, you raise -- undergirding your question is really a -- I think more robust demand question. And like I think I'll take this opportunity to help us think about demand a little bit more holistically. It's kind of folly to try to address demand prospectively. It's a little bit easier from a retrospective point of view, as long as one's not too myopic about the data. So what does the data tell us? That the market for Gulfstream airplane has been good over the last 12 months at a period of ramped up deliveries.  The book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.5 to 1 at Gulfstream and almost 1.1 to 1 for the trailing 12 months. This tells me that we're in a period of solid, but not overheated demand. And I see nothing in the data available to me at the moment that suggests a change in that picture. So that's how you ought to think about, as we go through the year, our expectations about the demand environment.
GeorgeShapiro: And then just a quick one on Marine. The revenues were somewhat less than I would have thought given the guidance of up 6% for the year and the margin was somewhat better. As we get increased revenues throughout the year, do we have the opportunity that the margin turns out to be higher than your 8.5%?
PhebeNovakovic: Well, look we'll always work towards improved margins. But remember the revenue is simply a question of timing and mix. And as we move from the Block III to Block IV, we have accounted for those margin changes as we see in every -- by the way we see this and you know this and every one of our transition from one block to the other, because we bid down a continuous learning curve and we have a -- each one of our contracts has the same sort of target profit. And on a share lines, so we always give back some of that goodness appropriately. So did the U.S. Navy, but what does that mean?  That means we've got to drive our operating performance relentlessly and continuously and we've done that now for 20 years. So, we will work very hard to consolidate and accelerate our learning on the Block IV, but at the moment we're pretty comfortable with the guidance we gave you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
DavidStrauss: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, want to try and put a finer point on GDIT. I think publicly it's been said that while '18 and '19 a relatively flat from a revenue standpoint that the '18 to 2020 kind of growth rate, you're still looking for is mid-single digits, is that correct?
PhebeNovakovic: Yes. And I don't think we've given you a whole lot of specificity about '20, but I tried to set some context to how to think about this growth profile. With that win rates, with the increasing budget and post-acquisition book-to-bill, we're in a very good place. So I look at this business as long-term good growth. In that budget it was about $100 billion, their addressable market budget is about $120 billion, 5% increase, almost 5% increase. That's pretty darn impressive. Good opportunities there.
DavidStrauss: Thanks. As a follow-up, Jason. Any quantification you can give on what the drag was in Q1 from the delay on the international side and any sort of idea around timing? I know you're expecting to reverse this year, but are this more of a second half item that you're looking for? Thanks.
JasonAiken: Yes, so the amount that continue to push to the right, I think of it as a roughly $1 billion, David, that's what we're talking about. It's lapsed over from last year and continues to push to the right.
PhebeNovakovic: And I think it's important to understand that these are negotiations between two sovereign powers, that are progressing, but they're very, very sensitive, as all of diplomatic negotiations are. Progress is good, but slow. We do anticipate it resolving this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
CaivonRumohr: Yes, thank you so much. So Phebe, I thought I heard you say that the Gulfstream 500 would move into the second production block in the second quarter. If that's the case, how come the margins aren't better than the first?
PhebeNovakovic: I think second half is what I said.
CaivonRumohr: Second half, excuse.
PhebeNovakovic: Yes. So I mean that's the inference from us being through that first block right, and we'll get through that in this quarter and get into the second lot in the second quarter. So, you're right.
CaivonRumohr: Got it. So GDIT obviously, you're looking for pretty good bookings. It's kind of we look around, there are several very large competitions for competitor programs in the network space, GSM-O and NextGen are, how in terms of looking at your expected growth do you factor those? Because obviously you have other competitors and if you win, things are going to be a lot better and if you lose, they won't be as good as you're projecting. So how do you factor them?
PhebeNovakovic: So if you think about us and you know us and you've known us for years. We are conservative, when we look at opportunities. We give healthy discount rates, I think that are a good thing to do for internally for the business and the forecast and guidance that we issue reflects that, those discounted rates. So the beauty of a business with 7,000 contracts is that frankly no one is positive. But I'm comfortable that they'll win their fair share. That said, we've approached this -- their pipeline through -- looking through a conservative prism.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
PeterArment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Phebe. Phebe, first question on Combat I guess, you mentioned some very positive comments regarding the fiscal '20 funding levels for some of the core platforms. I guess maybe just in the context of longer-term growth, how you're thinking about how those programs are shaping up domestically? And then what some of the international opportunities that you're pursuing are for that could supplement that growth? Thanks.
PhebeNovakovic: Sure. So the U.S. Army is recapitalizing, after the hot wars, they have utilized a lot of their equipment and as their budget slowed down rather precipitously, they did not have the resource to go and recapitalized, but they do now and that's exactly what they're doing. So they're modernizing their existing fleet in addition to developing new potential platforms. And we -- that existing fleet is our program, right. Stryker and Abrams have seen considerable increases in their budget funding lines because the Army needs those vehicles. The Abrams remains an outstanding tank and the upgrade in the version 4, is really not your father's Abram. It is a more capable, more survivable, more lethal system as is the Stryker. So we think those twp core franchise programs for us are in very, very good stead. We work very closely with our Army customer to understand their demands and their requirements and how they think about the war fighter and so we position ourselves in our investment dollars and also, thinking about the art of the possible for them and how we can help them meet their objectives. That's certainly true on the franchise programs. I've just talked about, but also on new programs, what is in the art of the possible what's doable how fast you can do it and what it is going cost you. And the key there is to have the trust of the Army customer, who believes that the estimates that you give them are reliable. So we've had a -- we are very aligned with our Army customer, know where they're headed. And I frankly like everything that I see here. And that's on the big vehicle programs, when I look at ammunition business, ammunition business is growing. I think we grew 10% in the quarter. And we've had our book-to-bill, there that's been very wholesome because as we increase our operational training tempo, our munitions and armaments will increase demands. So outside the United States, in North America, outside of the United States we see some recapitalization in the UK and Canada, where we have decade's long presence in both of those countries, throughout NATO and heavily in Eastern European. The world is getting a more dangerous place and unfortunately, but that is -- that creates demand for our products. Our European Land Systems has multiple opportunities throughout the Former Soviet Border States and Eastern Block and domestically and elsewhere. So you know threats drive funding and they drive the need for requirements and unfortunately we live in a world have increased threat.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
SheilaKahyaoglu: Good morning and thank you for the time, everyone, good quarter. Just a bigger picture question, I mean revenues were up I think 23% this quarter and profit was sort of flattish. How do we think about that inflection and profit growth in excess of revenue growth and timing of that and any maybe impediments to that that you see.
PhebeNovakovic: So let's break the businesses into two distinct factors. Aerospace, I think we've just given you a pretty fulsome and I going to walk you through that again, pretty fulsome explanation of the margin compression. And on the defense side, it's really about mix. When you're growing and you've got new contracts coming in, and you've got older contracts closing, you're going to have the mix issues and we frankly because all of our defense businesses are growing we have some of that right now. So that will resolve in continuing throughout the year and then into the future years as we get -- one thing you can absolutely rely on us for is superb operating performance. We are very good at improving what we control and we control our own operations. So you can expect us to get better and better and better as time goes by.
SheilaKahyaoglu: Thanks. I appreciate that. And just one follow-up, I think you mentioned $1 billion contract in Aerospace last quarter, was that booked?
PhebeNovakovic: I'm sorry, where?
SheilaKahyaoglu: You mentioned in Aerospace $1 billion contract with an existing corporate customer, was that booked in the quarter?
PhebeNovakovic: Right. So I couldn't hear you out. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Please go ahead with your question.
CarterCopeland: Good morning Phebe, Jason and Howard. Just two quick ones. One on the assumed certification on the G600 Phebe, do you think there's any risk there, just given the extra scrutiny and -- on things like ODA and what not, given the incident elsewhere in the industry, just -- I wonder if you could share any thoughts on that and just help give us some color, if there's any risk?
PhebeNovakovic: So, first the FAA and as we're targeting late June, but they've got a pretty rigorous process, so that may slip a week -- a couple of weeks or so, but I think importantly that does not impact our deliveries, which is really, I think the key underlying question. We have, not seen any new regulations or any new changes and the FAA oversight. So, we work very closely with them. Frankly, their partners and ensuring that we deliver base airplanes efficiently, and so they've got an additional workload, but so far haven't really seen much of an impact.
CarterCopeland: Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up. I noted the comments you made in the prepared remarks, around the cost progress on the missiles and the quality there, and obviously there's some uncertainty and risk when you took that work on, is there in your view the opportunity to maybe favorably retire some of that risk that you had foreseen as you continue to make progress and is this an indication maybe you're headed in that direction?
PhebeNovakovic: So cost is increasingly under control. The schedules, we de-risked a lot of the schedules. We're getting a lot of input from the manufacturing workforce, which will help us optimize our production, and again we're very, very good at manufacturing. So a lot of that risk is definitely behind us and it's going to get better.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
SethSeifman: Thanks very much and good morning. So I wanted to follow up on question that Peter asked earlier about the Combat business and when we look at the budgets that have come out for Abrams over the past couple of years and what's being requested for 2020. It's kind of in $2 billion-ish range, which seems like it's probably at least 2x, if not more what the Abram sales were last year. I mean should we be expecting Abrams sales over the next couple of years to advance to this level.
PhebeNovakovic: You should expect them to advance. Think about it this way, for a while that in the period where the Army funding was seriously constrained, that tank plant was producing one tank a month. At the end of this year, we'll be rolling out 30 tanks a months by the end of this year. So that obviously will drive revenue growth and that backlog increase translates 1 to 1 in the revenue.
SethSeifman: All right. And then just a follow-up 1.1, when we think about a point that you guys have made consistently in the past, is the impact of a mix shift towards domestic production on profitability in combat. Is that primarily an Abrams issue? Because you mentioned some -- that there's growth in Stryker, there's growth on the weapons and munition side. Is that primarily an Abram issue?
PhebeNovakovic: So there are two things. There is mix between domestic and international. And there's also the mix issue driven by older contracts and newer ones coming on board. So as Abram ramps up, remember we're also doing the mobile protective firepower. We were one of the two down select and so those -- again, we've got to move down our learning curve and that will ensue the performance over time.
HowardRubel: And operator, we'll just take one more question, please.
Operator: And our final question comes from Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead with your question .
MylesWalton: Thanks. Good morning. And Phebe, I'm curious, could you reflect on the certification process for the G500, G600 and how maybe it would influence your thinking of the next new aircraft? How you kind of publicly launch it versus privately launch it? Should we expect kind of timelines from public launch to anticipated EIS to maybe be a little bit shorter as you do more of the certification work behind the curtain?
PhebeNovakovic: Myles, if I told you any of that, that is just proprietary, but of -- listen, you would expect us to have lessons learned from everything we do. These have been extraordinarily successful developmental programs as these have been an extraordinarily successful test program. These airplanes are beating all of their design performance specifications. So we will continue to work closely with our FAA customer and it will continue to refine our processes going forward. But when we announce anything or how we announce that just sensitive.
MylesWalton: Okay. And Jason a clarification, the $1 billion push to the right, you mentioned on the Canadian LAV contract for Saudi. I think in the K, you've said $1.9 billion of unbilled receivables. Curious, can you kind of square those two and also the size of the current unbilled receivable? Thanks.
JasonAiken: Sure. So the balance between the two is basically the contract work in process. It's ongoing as you'd expect on any contract of this size. So that really is the delta there. And you'll see in the 10-Q we published later today that $1.9 billion that was reported at the end of the year is now up to $2.2 billion. End of Q&A
Howard Rubel: Operator. Thank you very much. Prior to the close, I'd like to first thank everybody for joining us today. And then secondarily, as a reminder, we refer you to our website for both the first quarter earnings release and our highlights presentation. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3117. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll close today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, Nicole, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning and thank you Howard. We enjoyed a solid fourth quarter, the results in comparisons with prior period were straightforward for the most part. As a result, I will go through them briefly to leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments, our outlook for 2019 and your questions. I also think you will find the press release and the additional presentation on our website fulsome and helpful. So earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.38 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $909 million and earnings of $3.07 per fully diluted share. This is a significant improvement against the fourth quarter of 2017, which was adversely impacted by a discrete, $119 million increase in the tax provision as a result of a 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Even after adjusting for the adverse impact in Q4, 2017. EPF was up $0.07 and earnings from continuing operations were up $154 million. Earnings per share at $3.07 also beat consensus by $0.09. Revenue and operating earnings were largely consistent with consensus. Most of the difference comes from a lower tax provision and a somewhat lower share count. For all-in-all, a solid quarter, with good performance, particularly compared to the year ago quarter as well as the third quarter of 2018. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.22. This is also $0.09 above consensus. Revenue was $36.2 billion was up over 2017 by $5.2 billion. On an organic basics, excluding CSRA, revenue was up $1.5 billion. Revenue was up across each of our reporting segments. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion were up $221 million or 5.2% over 2017. Earnings from continuing operations were up $446 million or 15.3% over 2017. Importantly, earnings per share from continuing operations were $166 above 2017. All-in-all, 2018 was a very good year. A year of growth and a year of important order intake that left the company well-positioned for 2019. I will review the full year and the quarters on a year-over-year basis for the groups without reference to sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue, higher operating earnings, higher earnings from continuing operations, and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter 2018. So let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.7 billion was up against the year ago quarter by an impressive $722 million, that is 36.4%. This was attributable both in large part to the delivery of nine G500 in the quarter, and also a strong fourth quarter in the service centers. For the full year, revenue of $8.46 billion was up $326 million, or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.49 billion were down $87 million on lower operating margins. The lower operating earnings were attributable to poor performance in the completions business at Jet Aviation, the mix shift at Gulfstream, and cost attendant to the introduction of the G500. This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate of 18% leading to forecasted earnings of $1.5 billion. We finished the year with more than forecasted revenue at 17.6% margin, and $1.49 billion of operating earnings. All-in-all, very close to the forecast we gave you this time last year. On the order front, activity in the quarter was good and the pipeline activity remains robust. The book-to-bill in Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8 to $1 denominated. You can see more information on deliveries and orders in the Exhibit J to the press release. We expect the G600 to be certified this year, although the exact timing is hard to predict given the impact of the government shutdown on the FAA. But we fully expect certification of the 600 this half. The pacing item for deliveries of the G500 and 600 will be our ability to deliver in the sales. We have that line in good order. Costs are increasingly under control and we are producing very good quality. But we had to restart the supply chain that had gone dormant with the far filing of the NORDAM bankruptcy proceedings. That has impacted right in our ability to keep schedule. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by mid-year. As a result, you will see accelerating G500 deliveries as the year progresses, and our ability to provide in the south to support G600 deliveries in the second half as well. Next, Combat Systems, Combat revenue of $1.74 billion was almost the same as the year ago quarter. The same holds true for operating earnings of $251 million and an operating margin of 15%. For the full year, revenue of $6.24 billion was up $292 million, just short of 5%. Operating earnings of $952 million were up $25 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin, largely related to mix shift. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the forecasts we provided at this time last year. We enjoyed somewhat better revenue than our initial forecast, which was an increase of $200 million to $250 million over 2017. We actually grew revenue $292 million. We forecast operating earnings of $970 and came in at $962, an $8 million shortfall largely attributable to the diplomatic issues that slowed production of a vehicle program in Canada in the fourth quarter. We continue to see nice order activity in this group, but fourth quarter orders of $2.19 billion, a book-to-bill of 1.3 to 1 in the quarter and 1 to 1 for the year. Tank orders alone are in excess of a billion. We also continue to have significant international opportunities particularly in Europe. We’ve been negotiating with Spain with respect to a program valued at $2 billion for Piranha vehicles. And of note, we acquired FWW, a qualified maintenance and service provider to the German Army and other international customers to enhance our position in a key market. FWW will become part of European land systems. In our U.S. market, our army customer is modernizing and providing a growing demand across our Combat vehicles and munitions business. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth, continued its history of strong margin performance and had very good order activity. Next, Marine Systems. This is a really good news story across the board. Marine revenue of $2.3 billion was up $237 million, a stunning 11.5% over the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $213 million were up $46 million against the year ago quarter, a 27.5% increase on a 120 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is very strong operating leverage in a growth environment. By the way, the sequential comparison equally impressive. For the full year, revenue of $8.5 billion was up $498 million in excess of 6%. Operating earnings for the year of $751 million were up $76 million over 11% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin. At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion and operating earnings of $735 to $745. We came in at the higher end of the revenue range. Operating earnings of $761 outperformed our forecasts by $16 million to $26 million. In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all three of our shipyards, we continue to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis at electric boat to prepare for increased production associated with the Block V of the Virginia submarine program and the new Columbia ballistic missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity. As you know, we have also increased our internal training program as well as our public private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trade. At $243 million CapEx in 2018 from Marine was more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect a Marine segment to command a larger share of our capital budget as we work towards satisfying the nation’s need for its critical naval systems. So far suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customers and increase the size of the fleet. As you are aware, the information systems technology group have been realigned and reshaped into two separate segments. Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and GDIT, a leading providers of Information Solutions to the federal government and its agencies. That was supplemented in the second quarter of 2018, by the acquisition of CSRA. I’m going to ask Jason to interject from comparison data here that you might find relevant and helpful.
Jason Aiken: On that note, let me make some comments about GDIT and Mission System’s performance in 2018. We originally guided to full year revenue for the former IS&T business group between $9.3 billion and $9.4 billion, and operating earnings of approximately one billion 30 million. If we look at how Mission Systems and GDIT excluding CSRA did for the year, they combined for $9.325 billion in sales, so in line with our expectations and that includes an organic growth rate of 4.3% for GDIT notwithstanding the impact of several divestitures during the year. From an operating earnings perspective, they were actually closer to $1.50 billion on a combined basis, so somewhat better than we had expected. So all-in-all a solid year for both businesses. As I alluded to, we also completed several portfolios shaping our activities in our GDIT segment during the year. These included the sale of a commercial health products business, CSRAs SETA business, and our public-facing call centers. These divestitures of more than $1 billion of annualized sales enhance the group's focus on high-end solutions and high-value added customer needs.
Phebe Novakovic: So let’s first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017 did not include CSRA, comparison to the year ago quarter are not particularly meaningful. However, sequentially revenue is up $75 million, operating earnings up $37 million and operating margin up 130 basis points, evidence of our continuing ability to extract cost synergies here. For the year, revenue was $8.27 billion and operating earnings were $608 million with a 7.4% margin, once again annual comparisons do not offer meaningful perspective since the prior year did not include CSRA. Next, Mission Systems. Revenue in the quarter was essentially flat against the year ago quarter, while operating earnings of $181 million were $6 million lower than the fourth quarter last year on a 40 basis point decrement in operating margin. For the year, revenue of $4.73 billion was up $245 million or 5.5%. Operating earnings of $659 million were up $21 million or 3.3% due to a 30 basis point decline in operating margin driven in part by mix. Book-to-bill for the year was somewhat above 1 times till the end of the year with the modestly higher backlog at 5.3 billion. So on this call last year on a company wide basis, our forecast for 2018 was to expect revenue of 32.35 billion to 32.45 billion. Operating earnings of 4.25 billion and an operating margin of 13.1%. And as you know, we wound up with $36.2 billion on an organic basis, but on an organic basis, revenue was up $1.5 billion, $500 million more than forecast. At the EPS line, we forecasted $10.90 to $11 and came in at $11.22 including, the transaction costs related to CSRA, which are about $0.20 [ph] per share. So let me provide our forecast for 2019, initially by business group and then on a companywide roll out. In Aerospace, we expect 2019 revenue to be about $9.7 billion, up more than $1.2 billion on deliveries of approximately 145 business jets. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of approximately 15.5%. The margin rate is lower than 2018 as a result of the mix shift as well as a modest increase in pre-owned sales, which again generally carry no margin. The revenue will be back-end loaded as well as the margin rate. In general, the quarterly spread in revenue progression will look something like $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion. Operating margin in the first two quarters should be in the mid 14 area, strengthening in Q3 and moving to well over 17 in Q4. We believe that last year will be the low point in operating earnings during this transition to our new models with modest earnings increase in 2019 and 2020, and significant earnings traction thereafter. In Combat, we expect revenue to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, $250 million to $350 million increase over 2018 with operating earnings of $965 to $975 slightly better than last year. Here again, look for both the revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to see solid growth for this business with orders for the Abrams and sudden demand for Stryker vehicles and munitions. We see domestic volume expanding faster than our international business. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $9 billion, a 6% or $500 million increase over 2018. Operating earnings in 2019 are anticipated to be about $770 million with an operating margin rate of around 8.5%. We anticipate growth in each of the yards with mix being reflected in margins. We continue to see long term growth with an expanding need for submarines, surface combat, and support ships and overhaul work. Our biggest opportunity here is around outperforming the forecasted margin rate. We expect information technology revenue in 2019 of approximately $8.3 billion consistent with 2018 with margins in the 7.5% range, a slight improvement over 2018s performance. To the plus side, we have a full year CSRA offset by the divestitures of the call centers and SETA businesses, which represented just over a billion of prior year revenues. We see the business making excellent progress towards optimizing the acquisition as we combine teams, deeply integrate business systems, consolidate facilities and increase our value proposition to diverse, defense, Intel and federal civilian agencies. For Mission Systems, we expect revenue in 2019 somewhere between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, an increase of just over $100 million or between 2% to 3%. We see strong growth in our maritime, cyber and space-related markets with fairly steady top line in our core tactical network incumbency. We are anticipating operating earnings up modestly over last year with margins in the mid, between mid and high 30s, once again building throughout the year. So for 2019, company-wide all of this roll up to approximately $38.5 billion of revenue up by 6% over 2018. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion and operating margin of around 11.7%. This gives us an EPS forecast of $11.60 to $11.70 per fully diluted share. I may emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a low 18% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, the first quarter should be seasonally low at about 20% of the full year’s results. The second quarter should be more than 10% better than that, and the third quarter should account for over 25% of EPS and the final quarter of the year could represent about one third of our EPS. So now let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary around cash backlog and other items and then we’ll take your questions.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Phebe. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $112 million bringing the interest expense for the year to $356 million. That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We repaid approximately $1.7 billion of this debt during the year, and will continue to prioritize paying down debt consistent with our Mid-A credit rating. We ended the year with $850 million of commercial paper outstanding, and our next scheduled fixed debt maturity is in the second quarter of 2020. For 2019, we expect interest expense to be approximately $430 million reflecting a full year of the notes issued in 2018. Our effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter and 17.8% for the year in line with our previous guidance. Looking ahead to 2019, we expect a full year effective tax rate in the low 18% range, between 18% and 18.5%. This is slightly higher than 2018, but recall in 2018, we took advantage of a onetime benefit provided by tax reform, and made a $255 million discretionary pension contribution, which lowered the tax rate by approximately 75 basis points. Looking at capital deployment, we paid $274 million in dividends in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to $1.1 billion. We also took advantage of the market decline in December, by purchasing our shares to a greater degree than planned. In the quarter, we purchased 7.6 million shares of our stock for $1.3 billion bringing the full year to 10.1 million shares for $1.8 billion. Looking ahead, while debt repayment will continue to be a priority as I mentioned, we continue to have the flexibility to adjust our capital deployment in response to changing market conditions as we did in December. Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed approximately $570 million to our plans in 2018, including the discretionary contribution. For 2019, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. We’ve also ramped up our capital expenditures, which were almost 2% of sales for the year. That’s up 60% from 2017, as we invest to support the growth of our businesses, particularly Marine Systems and Aerospace. For 2019, we expect capital expenditures to rise to 3% of sales, driven by the continued investment in the Columbia Class program. Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was 200% bringing our rate for the year to 78% excluding the discretionary pension contribution, and this is below our typical 100% conversion target. If you’re following the headlines out of Canada, you know there are discussions taking place between the Canadian government and their customer on our armored vehicle supply contract. As a result of these discussions, we’ve experienced payment delays that significantly impacted the free cash flow we expected last year. To be clear, this is a timing issue and we expect to receive the delayed payment this year. Assuming the resolution of this matter, we expect the cash conversion rate well in excess of 100% in 2019 and looking ahead, we expect cash performance throughout the planning horizon to be very strong in our typical 90% to 100% range. And one last point on backlog, we ended the year with total backlog of approximately $68 billion, that’s up 7.5% over this time last year. That increase came in spite of a headwind from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which reduced the backlog by $840 million, $700 million of which impacted the Combat Systems Group. Beyond the firm backlog, our total potential contract value, which includes options and IDIQ arrangements, increased by an impressive 17.5% over the end of last year, including the multi-billion dollar CHS-5 IDIQ award admissions systems. In addition, we entered into a $1.1 billion contract with an existing corporate customer for a multi-year airplane, multi-year order that requires their board approval this quarter. Once approved, that order will move into the firm backlog. So these awards along with the firm backlog provide a nice foundation for the continued growth we see ahead. Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I’ll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Howard Rubel: Thanks Jason. As a reminder, we asked participants ask one question and one follow up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Nicole, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Morning David.
David Strauss: Phebe, can you, can you give us a little bit more detail on the on the IT guide. I understand, with the divestitures, you know that’s a headwind on the top line, but you have one additional quarter of CSRA and in terms of the margin guide, I would have thought, we would have seen some margin improvement here given what’s going on with intangible, amortization and additional synergies? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So let’s talk a little bit about this business. In a growing environment last year, they had a one-to-one book-to-bill. They also have a 75% win rate and a $26 billion pipeline. This management team is performing the cost synergies beautifully, and frankly is a bit of ahead of schedule. By the way, this is a very energetic, innovative, management team that is really making GDIT into a workplace of preference. And in this market, people are absolutely critical and important across the board. But, people here truly matter. I might also add the cash performance on this business is outstanding. Last year, they generated over 100% percent of net income in cash and we’ll continue that this year and for the years to come. So, so what we see this year? Despite that large backlog -- despite the large win rate and book-to-bill is this is simply a question of timing, when the contracts move from the backlog into sales. And you’ll see the growth rate increase in the third quarter, fourth quarter and then significantly next year. This is just a question of the timing of several hundred contracts moving from backlog, into our sale. That also is impacting the margin rate. So I’m very confident in the ability of this business to perform than outperform their cost synergy. They are growing great cash performance, so in the instance right now, it’s simply a question of timing.
Jason Aiken: And Dave, if you want me to, I’ll add a little bit of additional color around your influence on margin rates. If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group. If you normalize that for the amortization burden that came with the CSRA acquisition and take that out, you actually end up with a margin rate of 9.6% for the year. So that’s a couple of hundred basis points better than we reported and about 110 basis points better than the year ago 2017 full year rate. That’s really driven by the CSRA contribution from an operations perspective if you will. So they actually contributed approximately 10.9% incremental margins on the core business, excluding at amortization benefit. Now when you look ahead to next year, when you take the puts and takes on the revenue side between the additional quarter of CSRA volume offset by the divestitures were nominally up, let’s just call it notionally flat, but nominally up. So even though we do have because of the accelerating amortization schedule that we have for this business, even though we do have a somewhat declining quarterly amortization burden, the fact that we have four full quarters of amortization versus a flattish to slightly nose knows up total top line is actually perhaps counter intuitively a little bit of a margin drag for next year. It will start to accelerate for the following year once we have a full up year-on-year comparison. So if you think about amortization, is really call it a 20 – I’ll call the 20ish basis point drag. The other part of it is -- is we do have synergies as Phebe mentioned that are accelerating, so I’d call that maybe an 80 basis point to 90 basis point assist, as we go forward and we’ll continue to accelerate after that. And then from a mix perspective issue alluded to, when we talked about this for some time after the acquisition, we did forecast, call it 100 basis point to 150 basis point contraction overall in the incremental CSRA margins over the next 3, 4 years. So call it 50 basis points or so from that. So, if you take the 20ish basis points on amortization, if you call it 50 basis points on mix offset by a positive 80 basis point to 90 basis point improvement from synergies, you get call it 10 basis point to 20 basis point that improvement for the year, and we would see it accelerating after that. So, hopefully that color is helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the Aerospace demand environment. This was the basing concerns out there about the global economy and whether that's had any flow-through to customer demand for your product in the last three months. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: So I may pass that for you. Our North American demand is robust and growing. Western Europe is been -- it’s been very active for us translating into addition to orders as well as considerable activity in our pipeline. I would say some of the emerging markets are a little bit more cautious. They tend to be focused on the 650 and on new products, but overall very very nice, very nice demand and interest in North America and Western Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein: Yes. Good morning. Another maybe follow up question quickly on Aerospace. When you compare this release to your last release last quarter, and you’ll get the estimated potential contract value, it went up by almost a billion. Can you help us understand what that means and what gets thrown in that pile and why it would go up by a billion?
Phebe Novakovic: Well let me ask Jason, to give you a little color on that.
Jason Aiken: So Ron, one of the last comments that I made was around this area and it typically in the estimated potential contract value bucket for the defense businesses. That’s clearly contract options and IDIQ potential value. For Aerospace, it holds a number of items to include options for aircraft as well as longer term arrangements that we have with individual customers. So where deliveries may be further out in the delivery queue and spread out in the backlog. So as I mentioned, we did have in the fourth quarter, a fairly large contract signed up with an existing commercial customer it was valued at just over a billion dollars. It’s a multi aircraft, multi-year arrangement that spans out over several years that did not go into the firm backlog because that order is actually subject to that customer’s board approval coming up later this quarter. So we expect that to happen this quarter, and we’ll move into the firm backlog, and be counted as traditional orders at the time. But given the maturity of that and where it was in the quarter, that’s why we put it in the as we typically are conservative on these notions, we put it in the potential contract value bucket versus in the firm backlog till we till we get to that firm order.
Ronald Epstein: Okay great. And if I may do one follow up for Phebe. When you think about the current political environment and what that means for defense spending, and then how do you pass through that? It seems like there’s just a lot of uncertainty and volatility going on. So you know in your experience, how do you think about it?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, some of the political contretemps haven’t necessarily affected their defense spending if and in fact, defense spending has been increasing in this environment. So we are quite comfortable that we’re going to see through our at least initial planning horizon, very nice funding for all of our key programs. So I haven’t seen too much perturbation as a result of some of the extant issues with respect to the overall budget impacting defense.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning Phebe or Jason. I wanted to see if we could dig a little bit more into the margin pressure you expect in the front end of 2019 and what you saw on the back end of 2018. How do we pass the pressure between the completion issues Phebe that you cited at Jet Aviation, just the general learning curve and conversions you’re doing on five hundreds and six hundreds, and specifically NORDAM. Where does NORDAM factor into this, and how quickly do you get a lift as that problem diminishes?
Phebe Novakovic: So let’s take it in reverse order. We’ve got on Nacelle line well under control, the cost performance has been quite good. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we’ve had to spool back up the supply chain. That is the pacing item with respect to our timing of our deliveries, but the supply chain is doing well and it’s just going to take them a while to begin to have the capacity and the throughput and product to feed our demand. So I will see a little bit of slowness on that on the delivery in the south. But as we get into the second half, that will have completely resolved and we will be in full rate production throughout the supply chain. So we’re quite pleased with that. The margin compression it has been something we’ve been talking to you all for some time about. As you all know, the first lot of airplanes in this case, we’re talking about the G500 carried very little margin. Those airplanes will ramp up, continue to ramp up that production and first quarter, second quarter as we move from that initial lot to carry those lower margins and you’ll see some, we will see some margin expansion on that line. The 600 will come in at slightly higher entry margins, simply because of the disproportionate amount of test cost and on deep costs borne by the 500. And then we’ll nicely come down its learning curve. So those are some of the issues that we would see with respect to the margins. The completion business, the jet we had a problem this year on really on the operating side. We have fixed that, and going forward, we’re comfortable that they will do better this year.
Robert Spingarn: So Jet is not really not part of the 2019 pressure?
Phebe Novakovic: No, [Indiscernible]. No they’re not. They will do better this year because of the affirmative and proactive steps they took in 2018. So you think -- much about mix.
Robert Spingarn: Once you’re through this year, do you recover to the old margins at Aerospace?
Phebe Novakovic: We’ll have, as we continue to come down on a learning curve. We finish up a lot of the 500, the first lot of 500 airplanes, the first flight of 600 airplanes; you can expect us to come quickly down our learning curve. And I mentioned in my remarks, we’ll see some earnings and margin expansion in 2020 and then really quite nice expansion and considerable earnings growth thereafter, as we have completed all of those two transitions. So I’m not going to predict exactly where we end up on new airplanes with respect to terminal margins here. But, you should expect us to continue the strong operating performance you have seen from us. We know how to build these airplanes, low cost high, quality provider. We're good at that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping we could get some color on that Canadian Lab program that was weighing on the conversion this year, and you probably had maybe a billion of revenue on that program. I’m curious, are you getting, are you getting any cash on the program an ongoing basis, and what would the conversion have looked like if not for the progress delays?
Phebe Novakovic: So let me give you some context here Myles. This is a valid contract that all parties to that contract have repeatedly and recently attested to their commitment to honor that contract. The Canadian government fully understands the importance of our high end manufacturing and engineering talent in London, Ontario and the robust supply chain that we have throughout the country. Our payment issue got caught up in a larger international political issue diplomatic issue. That's why we got some payment last year. Those diplomatic contretemps affected, that slowed the payment that they would otherwise have anticipated. So that will resolve. It’s a timing issue, and we’re quite comfortable and quite confident that that will resolve just at a slower rate than we had anticipated.
Myles Walton: In just about a breadbox around it, Jason would you have been above 90% adjusted for pension conversion if you get this?
Jason Aiken: That’s correct. We would have then call it net 95%, 200% range we’ve been targeting.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Phebe, I wanted to ask on Gulfstream. I thought, you’d implied in the third quarter that the book-to-bill would get close to one. So if you just comment on what might have happened, so since we wound up somewhat less than that?
Phebe Novakovic: I believe George what I said was that the orders would be better in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter. In fact, they were. And you know the book-to-bill was nice particularly I think. But when you look at the addition of delivery, a considerable number of additional deliveries that we added in the fourth quarter. But you know the quarterly book-to-bill, if you go back and looked at Gulfstream, Aerospace tends to have some lumpiness that we had very nice order activity last year, and the fourth quarter was about what we anticipated the orders would be better than the third quarter. And I would also point out that we’ve got a, Jason talked about at some length, a billion dollar order with a customer that once it gets cleared by its board, moves into backlog. So I consider that, we had a good -- we had a good order quarter.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then just could you quantify at all how much the incremental costs at NORDAM may have impacted the margin in the quarter?
Phebe Novakovic: Now that’s almost impossible to deconstruct. I’m very pleased with how quickly we’ve got some really good operators in Tulsa. And I’m really pleased at how quickly they were able to stabilize the line. We’ve got good performance, good cost control. And frankly, we’ve got now aligned supply chain. Though, I don’t know the any particular impact of that in with any specificity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning all.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Carter.
Carter Copeland: Phebe, just given where we are in the life cycle of the 650, I know historically you’ve given us sort of a framework and how you think about products and their lifecycle and we just got the seventh anniversary of entry and a service on the 650. So I think we’ll be halfway through that kind of 15 year life cycle that you usually reference in the next couple of quarters, and I wondered if you could just kind of update us on how you think about the lifecycle of that particular product as we look forward in this year.
Phebe Novakovic: So I am -- as you can well imagine, not about comment on what our thinking is about new product introductions, but you can imagine that our pea-shooter is full, that’s the way you ought to think about it.
Carter Copeland: Okay, then I’ll try another one. Jason, the comment on CapEx, just as we think about cash flow. When -- when do you see the Marine? I’m not – I’m not sure if you can answer this yeah just based on the planning. But, when should we think that the CapEx build in Marine sort of levels off from a longer term standpoint. Is that still a couple of years away?
Jason Aiken: It is, its call it over the next couple of years two, between two and three years and then you’ll see that tail back to a more normal level. So as I mentioned, over the more intermediate planning horizon, we do continue to see that. I think more reliable 90 to 90% to 100% cash conversion rate as a result.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes thank you very much. So, Phebe, I believe Mark Burns who runs a Gulfstream has said at some point you’ll have a competitor to the global 70 500 in the market. And you obviously have an opportunity back where the 450 was. And, you obviously have probably taken a little bit longer than you expected on certifying the G600. So if we think about R&D, was that high in the fourth quarter -- higher -- high relatively high in the fourth quarter, and you know what, what comment can you give us in terms of what sort of a drag that will be on 2019?
Phebe Novakovic: So let me just gently tease you a bit about not trafficking in what I call rumor intelligence or not. So with that cautionary note, our certification has come along quite nicely. As I told you, it’s a little slower than we anticipated. You know this is a -- this is a detailed and appropriately robust process that unfortunately got impacted by the shut down and I apologize for my early optimism, but originally, in plan, our internal plan was first quarter and we think that, that because of that perturbations of the shutdown that’s going to move into the second quarter. Jason will talk about the R&D.
Jason Aiken: Yeah. Cai, the R&D for the quarter was essentially flat year-over-year. It was up a little bit sequentially from the third quarter if you go back and look at that data, call it by a roughly $20 million or so. I think for the year we ended up right around 1.5% of sales for total Company-sponsored R&D. So I don’t think high or low in any anomalous way, and I think we expect to see, as we have in the past, a continued steady drip, and Phebe alluded to it on R&D, as we continue to -- the pipeline of new product introductions and technology introductions. So I don’t think anything anomalous up or down.
Cai von Rumohr: Got it. Thank you. Just a last quick one. Congratulations on your aggressive share repurchase in the fourth quarter. Should we assume that you carry your comparable opportunistic approach into this year? And would you legally have been able to buy any shares early in this quarter?
Phebe Novakovic: You wisely have assumed that we will continue our opportunistic buying. And you -- I think you well know about the mechanism for share buybacks during the blackout. So I think we’ll leave a comment around that later. But we were very active in the fourth quarter, I think that's the way to think about it.
Howard Rubel: Operator, we have time for two more questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Phebe. Phebe, just thinking about some of the good news that’s going on in Marine, and just thinking back to your kind of your longer-term targets there, you’ve had some really nice contract wins since those projections. So is this volume falling outside of that kind of scope for the 2020 targets? Or is this delivering you some additional upside, because it seems like you are tracking ahead of that. Just some additional color there would be great.
Phebe Novakovic: So the proponents of the growth we are going to see is, is at Electric Boat and submarines. We’ve gotten some nice wins at past. I think they’ve got 11 DDG-51s in their backlog now, and they will continue to turn through those. NASSCO started its first containership Matson about two months early. They’re working on the next oiler, and they’ve got that extraordinarily versatile platform in the ESB. So they have done nicely with slow steady growth, but the real growth driver is Electric Boat. And you see that in two respects. Both on the – we’ve got the Virginia class two-year volume in Block IV, and then Block V is a -- as I noted in my remarks, really a significant upgrade into the performance, and it is a let me just leave it at that. It is -- it will drive additional revenue, incremental revenue. And then the advent of the Columbia, which will begin early construction in next year. So this is a steady growth engine for us as we’ve been saying for some time. I’m very pleased with them.
Operator: Our next question and our last question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Hunter Keay: Thank you for squeezing me on. Phebe, just another question on sort of product development. As you think about sort of the long-term and some lessons learned on the G650. You talked a lot about speed before as being an important value proposition to your new customers for these high-end products. Is there any sort of evolving sort of appetite for new capabilities beyond just speed, as you think about product development in the next 5 to 10 years? Is it like runway access, access to remote regions, anything like that? Or is it really just sort of like a speed concept to sort of the next value proposition?
Phebe Novakovic: Speed is important, but as you can well imagine, we continue to upgrade and innovate around the avionics, cabin comfort, and the engines, both in fuel efficiency, decibel levels, and -- and look, these airplanes are getting better and better and better across the spectrum. Speed, for us, is an important commodity, because people’s time is precious, so you’re quite right, deposit, but that has been our focus, but it is by no means the single and exclusive focus.
Hunter Keay: Thank you.
Howard Rubel: Thank you, operator. With that we will end our call. If you -- if anybody has follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out and call me. My number is 703-876-3117. Thank you all again, and you can sign off.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics' Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter 2018 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 for fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion, and income from continuing operations of $864 million. The EPS performance was $0.37 better than the year-ago quarter and $0.13 better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that our revenue was somewhat lower, margins somewhat higher and operating earnings essentially in line. Most of the beat occurred on the tax line. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $1.5 billion or 20%, attributable in large part to the CSRA acquisition. However, revenue was up 4.6%, excluding the impact of CSRA. All five reporting segments grew quarter-over-quarter. Operating earnings were up $72 million, a 6.8% increase, and income from continuing operations was up $100 million, a 13.1% increase. The quarter's operating margin at 12.5% is 150 basis points lower than third quarter 2017, largely attributable to the amortization expense of the CSRA transaction. In terms of economic earnings, the operating earnings absent the amortization expense related to the transaction were $1.2 billion with an operating margin of 13.2%. Sequentially, revenue was down $92 million, or 1%, and operating earnings were up $47 million. The two quarters were very much alike. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $25.8 billion is up $3.12 billion, or 13.7%. Operating earnings were up $55 million, or 1.7%. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations were up $173 million, 7.6%, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.71 or 9.5% better year-to-date. With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $790 million and free cash flow from operations of $622 million after a discretionary pension payment in the quarter of $255 million. We continue to invest appropriately for the future. Capital spending at the Marine group has more than doubled to $147 million year-to-date, and expenditures at Aerospace have totaled $142 million for the nine months, as the business units continued to invest at a level necessary to expand facilities to support our customers' requirements. As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a very healthy backlog increase in the quarter. The total backlog of $69.53 billion is a $3.24 billion increase, roughly 5% over the second quarter of this year, and $5.6 billion increase over the year-ago quarter. While there was very good contract activity in all groups, there was particularly strong order intake at the Marine group, Information Technology and Mission Systems. Mission Systems enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1.2 times and a sharp increase in its estimated potential contract value as a result of several IDIQ contracts. GDIT's book-to-bill was a sterling 1.4. Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, starting with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $36 million, or 1.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017, and operating earnings were nearly flat, off $5 million, or 1.3%, to $376 million on an operating margin of 18.5%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $136 million, or 7.2%, with a $10 million reduction in operating earnings on lower margins, as expected. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $396 million, or 6.4%, and operating earnings are off $133 million, or 10.7% on a 90 basis point reduction in operating margin. The revenue picture will be stronger in the fourth quarter with the delivery of 8 to 10 G500s. By the way, the first G500 was delivered in September and the second several days ago. We had a good order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill measured in dollars values of orders. Gulfstream alone was 0.9 to 1 on the same basis. While order intake was certainly satisfactory in the group, it was not as good as we had anticipated. It was hampered by the contretemps surrounding NORDAM's financial issues and its inability to deliver nacelles to Pratt on schedule. This caused numerous G500 and G600 prospects to hold fire until we could provide more reliable delivery times. That, I am pleased to say, is behind us and should help fourth quarter intake. Gulfstream has taken over the production of nacelles and is making very good progress on both cost and schedule. Deliveries of nacelles are in line to support the 8 to 10 G500s next quarter. I can also tell you that our pipeline in sales discussions are quite active. We are, again, reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look better than the third quarter, even accounting for the increased delivery in Q4. On a trailing 12 months basis, the book-to-bill is slightly in excess of 1 to 1. Our certification front continues to progress well on the G600 and we anticipate certification shortly before year-end with deliveries commencing next year. The G600 has profited from the work done on the G500, so those first delivery lot will carry better gross margins. The G500 with 5,200 nautical miles of range at 0.85 can travel 4,400 nautical miles at 0.9. Just to put that in some context; 4,400 nautical miles was the approximate range of its predecessor, the G450 at 0.8 mach, cutting nearly an hour from long-range flight. The G600 with 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.85 mach has now also demonstrated 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.9 mach, actually quite stunning. If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We have done so with the G500 and will do so with the G600. Next, Combat Systems, Combat had a solid quarter with revenue of $1.52 billion, operating earnings of $241 million and 15.8% operating margins. Compared to the third quarter in 2017, revenue was up $23 million, or 1.5%, but earnings were down $6 million or 2.4% on a 70 basis point decline in margin. On a sequential basis, the second and third quarters were very much alike, with no material difference in volume or profit. Year-to-date revenue was up over 2017 by $296 million or 7%. Operating earnings are up $24 million, or 3.5%, despite a 50 point basis decline in operating margin. I should point out that Combat Systems has now reported quarter over year-ago quarter increases in revenue for eight consecutive quarters. All of our major programs are performing well. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally and domestically. Importantly, our work with the U.S. Army has increased nicely. In addition to fully supporting the Abrams main battle tank, the Army has recently placed a $383 million order to upgrade 173 Strykers to the A1 configuration, the newest, most powerful and capable version of the vehicle. The order will complete the fourth brigade and begin the process of modernizing the fifth, part of a process to modernize all nine brigades. We are also actively involved with the Army's longer-term modernization efforts and have developed innovative and cost-effective solutions to meet their requirements. For Marine, the group reported revenue of $2 billion, a $72 million or 3.7% increase compared to the year-ago quarter. In contrast, revenue was down sequentially by $165 million, or 7.6%. Operating earnings for the third quarter at $169 million were down $10 million compared to last year's quarter. As expected, there was a sequential decline in profit margins due to mix. Year-to-date revenue of $6.2 billion was higher by $261 million, or 4.4% and operating earnings of $548 million were up $30 million, or 5.8% over 2017. Revenue across the year has been driven by construction of the Virginia-class Block IV, Block V design and Columbia design work. Offsetting this was timing related to ship repair and other naval construction work. With four recent awards for repair work, we should expect a step-up in volume for that category. Just prior to the close of the quarter, we received a multi-year contract from the Navy for four DDG 51 Flight III ships. The $3.9 billion contract affords Bath the opportunity to move down the learning curve and improve its performance. The ships are scheduled as part of the FY 2019 through 2025. We told you last quarter that we would report IS&T in two segments, Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and GDIT, one of the leading providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, intelligence agency and federal civil agencies. Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems' revenue at $1.23 billion was $144 million, or 13.3% higher than last year's quarter. Year-to-date revenue of $3.48 billion was higher by $249 million, or 7.7% over last year. Operating earnings of $179 million were up $27 million, or 17.8% compared to the third quarter last year, with mix and the benefit of operating leverage generating the better performance. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings were up $27 million or a 6% increase. I have already commented upon Mission Systems' very strong order intake in the quarter, which further supports their anticipated organic and future growth. Moving to Information Technology, the business generated revenue of $2.3 billion in the quarter, up $1.2 billion or 116% over the year-ago quarter. The revenue for GDIT was up 7.1%, excluding CSRA. By the way, we're not going to be able to break out CSRA revenue for you after this year. Operating profits were $1.57 million, up $56 million or 55%. Reported margins were 6.8%, down from 9.5% in the year-ago quarter. But excluding the acquisition related amortization of $64 million, margins were 9.6%. CSRA was modestly accretive in the quarter. It is $0.05 accretive year-to-date, excluding transition costs. This is really quite remarkable this early in an acquisition. The integration plan is sound and continues to deliver early results. Finally, we've announced the divestiture of our call centers to MAXIMUS as part of our portfolio-shaping strategy. This transaction creates focus on enterprise IT solutions and high-end professional services. We are business-to-business focused and this shifts us away from the more public-facing markets. These assets are well-placed with MAXIMUS, for whom it is core. By the way, this transaction will have no material impact to 2018 results. So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year are concerned, we fully expect fourth quarter revenue in excess of $10 billion and operating margins consistent with the last quarter. However, we expect a higher effective tax rate of around 21% in the quarter. For the year, stronger-than-expected operating results year-to-date offset in part by the $75 million of CSRA transactions costs and a lower-than-planned tax rate enabled us to increase guidance for the year from a range of $11 to $11.05 to a range of $11.10 to $11.15 for the year. This late in the year we anticipate our end-of-year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the range is narrow. As tempting as it may be this time of year to ask us about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight in the upcoming year. The guidance we gave you last January is grounded in that process, and as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from me in January with more detail, as has been our custom for many years. So let me spend a minute telling you how I see this year in perspective. We are growing 4.9% without CSRA. We have double-digit EPS growth. Gulfstream is growing at 4.5%, and that's particularly impressive during a year of transition. The CSRA integration is ahead of schedule. The U.S. Army is recapitalizing, and the Marine group is steady as she goes. And Mission Systems is performing beautifully. And finally, our backlog is large and growing, which puts us in very good stead for next year. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.
Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $114 million, bringing the year-to-date expense to $244 million. That compares to $27 million and $76 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $355 million. Our effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter and 17.1% year-to-date. This is lower than our previous expectation and is attributable to the finalization during the quarter of our 2017 tax return. As a result, we are lowering our target for the full year tax rate from our previous estimate of 19% to a rate in the low 18% range. This implies a fourth quarter tax rate of approximately 21%. One more point on the income statement. We had a discontinued operations charge in the quarter of $13 million or $0.04 per share. You'll recall, we sold a piece of the CSRA business due to an organizational conflict of interest issue. Under the accounting rules, this sale resulted in a breakeven pre-tax GAAP P&L outcome. However, there was a gain on the sale for tax purposes, and the tax expense on that gain is reported in discontinued operations. Turning to capital deployment, we paid $275 million in dividends in the third quarter and purchased 450,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.5 million shares year-to-date for $522 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. In addition, as Phebe discussed, in light of the benefits associated with the recent tax reform, we made a $255 million discretionary contribution to our pension plan in the quarter and have ramped up our capital expenditures, which we expect to be in excess of 2% of sales for the year. We also repaid $1.1 billion of commercial paper in the quarter, consistent with our priority of rapidly repaying the debt issued to finance the CSRA acquisition. To that end, we expect to fully repay our CP balance by the end of the year, which will retire over a quarter of the borrowings from the acquisition. Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was over 90%, excluding the discretionary pension contribution. And for the year, we expect our free cash flow to be in the low to mid-90% range, reflecting our typical 100% conversion target, less the additional pension contribution. Finally, one more follow-up to Phebe's comments about our order activity in the quarter, the total company book-to-bill was 1.4 times in the quarter, resulting in a 5% increase in the total backlog to $69.5 billion. And when you include options and IDIQ contracts, the total potential contract value increased to an all-time high of $104.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This backlog growth is all the more impressive given the ongoing headwind presented by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which impact our Combat Systems segment, in particular, given its significant international footprint. Specifically, over the first nine months of the year, FX rate changes driven by the strong dollar reduced the segment's backlog by $600 million. Of course, this is an accounting translation effect with no economic value implication, but a headwind to the reported numbers nonetheless. Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question, so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back in the queue. Gary, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: The first question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the G500 and just this whole NORDAM situation. Only because United Technologies talked about a settlement, I believe, that there was a cash inflow. So, can you help us in terms of any impact that might have had in terms of the P&L and did it occur in this quarter or is it something that is still to come in the fourth quarter?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, there were no material adjustments to revenue or earnings as a result of this settlement. That said, the details of the settlement are subject to a non-disclosure agreement, so that's all we can say.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, David.
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Phebe, I wanted to ask about a couple part question on Gulfstream. So, I know you said you didn't want to talk about 2019, but I think this is fair game since you've talked about before, just the operating income cadence from here in 2019 and 2020 relative to the $1.5 billion for Gulfstream. I think you talked about a slight increase in 2019 and a slight increase off of that in 2020, how you feel about that now. And then, NBAA, we heard comments about G550 orders coming through pretty well and the rate going up there, but we also heard about maybe a little bit nearer-term availability on G650; if you could tell us where that stands today. Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, let me just get clarity on the first part of your question. Can you restate that for me?
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. So, previously, I believe you've talked about $1.5 billion in EBIT at Gulfstream in 2018 and then a slight increase in 2019 and a slight increase off of that in 2020. If that still holds, how you feel about that. Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, I don't want to get into 2019, but think about it this way. We have 8 to 10 of the G500s delivering this year that carry really relatively very low margins. We'll have the remainder of that lot delivering in 2019. And then, as we move into the G600 production, those margins are going to be higher since the G500 carried a disproportionate burden of the test program. So, all-in-all, we're comfortable with the implied guidance that we gave you back in January this year and that's about all I could go into at the moment until we set all of our production rates. So that's with respect to that. On the G550, we adjust that rate accordingly. We haven't made that decision yet, but there is very nice demand for that platform, particularly in the ISR space. So as long as there continue to be government customers who see this as a powerful ISR system, and then we'll continue to produce those at fairly low level. And the availabilities of G650 are still out there. I'm not aware of any near-term availabilities whatsoever.
Operator: The next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Hey, good morning, all.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: I just want to go back quickly to the NORDAM settlement. I mean UTC was pretty explicit yesterday that they had a $300 million payment related to that. So I can appreciate the terms of the NDA, but just methodologically speaking, if you didn't have a gain in Q3 and the guidance doesn't imply a gain in Q4, like where does this $300 million go?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: First of all, no one can discern the number. Second of all, it is simply not material. So I – and while UT can be a little more expansive on this agreement, we, however, are bound by a nondisclosure, which I will not violate. So there you go.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Phebe, on the defense side of the business, obviously been some issues with Saudi Arabia of recent. I was wondering if you could comment on what the potential backlog exposure you have is to Saudi Arabia and whether this is having any impact on your near-term order prospects.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So I don't know what the backlog is. We don't look at it in that regard. I will tell you the largest contract we have is with the government of Canada. We are continuing to build that vehicle on schedule, and we see no indication that that contract has changed, the status of that contract has changed in the moment. So, steady as she goes.
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning, Phebe. Quick question just, I guess, on Marine Systems – I mean, Mission Systems. The margin performance continues to be really impressive there. 14.6% and 13.8% year-to-date. I mean, is there a natural ceiling here for margin when you look at the contract mix? Or what's the kind of cadence, I guess, when you think about Mission Systems?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, Mission Systems margins are driven most especially by mix and product mix. And that can, in any given quarter, in any given year, vary. But their performance, I think, is indicative of their future performance, again, driven by their mix. And it's wholly dependent on thousands of different products and simply the timing of the orders and the profitability of various different products within that portfolio.
Operator: The next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, can you just do me a favor and parse back that comment you made around the margin differential between the G500 and G600, particularly around the test flights? Is it fair to assume that the margins on the G600 should probably hit a double-digit rate before G500, despite the G500 deliveries ramping a little bit quicker?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Oh, I'm not going to parse that. I don't think I know that in the moment. And frankly, I start to get nervous about giving specificity of margins by airplane that becomes highly competitive. But the fact is, is they will carry better gross margins because they do not have the larger share of the test program. And you'll recall, there was a fair amount of commonality between the G500 and the G600 test program. So we'll come down quickly. We'll go up where margins will increase nicely on the G500 once we get through the first lot, and they will continue to perform well once we – it's an analogous performance on the G600. Think about it that way. But just at a higher start rate.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Hey. I have one clarification question, and one question. So on the clarification, you mentioned the fourth quarter color of greater than $10 million sales and segment margin similar to last quarter. I just wanted to make sure you're talking about 2Q and not the 3Q reported number?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes.
Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Okay. 2Q. And then in terms of the top-line, the greater than $10 billion and the implied 4.9% organic growth, I just want to make sure we are triangulating to the right sales number, so we are now looking somewhere in the lower $36 billion? Is that right, for the full year?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes. Yes, and we gave you, you will be able to discern all of the particular puts and takes in the Q. We have laid all that out for you, okay? So that should help you.
Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Is there a particular segment, I imagine it's Aerospace on the G500 deliveries, is that right?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, there's Aerospace in two regards. One, it looks like we are going to have considerably lower pre-owned sales than we had anticipated, which frankly is a good thing from a bottom-line perspective. And as you quite accurately point out, we've had fewer G500 deliveries than we had originally anticipated. And then on the other defense groups, it's really just a question of timing and when the contracts get executed. So nothing of note across any of the defense units.
Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: All right. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, George.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: On your comment, Phebe, about the book to bill of being 0.9 and you didn't have G500 and G600 orders delayed but you didn't deliver any G500s, so the fact that the book to bill was 0.9, does that imply G650 orders or G550 book to bill were less than one? And also, what's the number of months now that you are sold out to on each of those planes? Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, I don't track that data that you asked for. And by the way, I have come to a conclusion that I'm not going to give you detailed, first available, because it becomes meaningless with all these new airplanes coming out. We may ultimately go back to that but there's too much churn in the next year or so because we've got so many new airplanes coming out. But they are well within the comfortable levels that I've talked about before, so I don't have any concern across our existing plane portfolio.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: But was the book to bill less than one for the G650 and/or the G550?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No, we don't track that.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay. I will stick with my one. Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Painful as it is for you.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: That's right.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I wanted ask – hey, good morning, Phebe. I wanted to ask you about Marine, couple of things on Marine. The first and they're both on margins. I wanted to think about the ramp of the Columbia over the next couple of years, few years and how we should think about margins on that. And then separately on the DDG-51, the recent award, which has the Huntington pricing, you've got four ships there out of 10, how do we think about that impact from a margin perspective? I suppose while we're at it, perhaps we could talk about revenues too.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, we were very pleased with the outcome of that competition with four ships, because it gives Bath a nice opportunity to improve its profitability. And if you think about Bath's performance, on the DDG-1000, we've had terrific ship over ship learning. We have delivered the first of the restart, I think, guess the second of the restart ships on the DDG-51 and the third is under construction. We are seeing some nice ship over ship learning there. So from my point of view, this is a wholesome development for Bath and gives us really the opportunity to get where they need to be. With respect to margins, a bit large, I think in Marine. Right now, margin performance in the Marine group is driven almost entirely by timing and mix at Electric Boat. You've got higher Block IV and Columbia-class engineering volume lower margins offset by the lower Virginia-class Block III, a very mature contract that is close to – I think we delivered our final ship. So, if you recall, you've been with us now through three of these block transitions and remember that we did these ships on a continuous learning curve. So, it's incumbent upon us to ensure that we've got the operating excellence moved down our learning curve and we've done that with all three ships, or all three blocks. And you're just going to see some of that again on Block IV. There are, however, opportunities to improve those margins on Block IV, obviously, as we have in the past, and we've got improvements coming at Bath and NASSCO. Ultimately, margins can benefit as we – if you think about Columbia as we decrease our engineering work and move more toward construction of Columbia, but none of that will be clear until we get a contract in place on Columbia. And we don't think we're going to see that for the next year or so.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Should we think about, though, as your mix of business going to a less mature phase, though, so overall margins could drift down a little bit?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I don't want to get out there too much on margins. I said something, I think, inadvisably the last time, I think, on this call. And the way that I think about these margins is, look, we've got quarter variability, but the trend is there. And there's a lot of moving parts as we move into Columbia, because the decrease in the cost plus decrease in the engineering work, which carries lower margins and the advent of construction, that offers some opportunities. So, I think that at the moment it's too soon to tell, but there is potential to get better.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi.
Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I was wondering if you could talk about some of the portfolio-shaping opportunities you've had thus far. Is there space to do a little bit more in terms of trimming down CS GDIT or is that about it? And then, also on the other side, is there capacity to do more M&A, as that integration seems to be progressing well and you're progressing down the deleveraging process? Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So as is our want, we are constantly looking for opportunities to shape our portfolio to better align our lines of business with our core. And in the case of the large public-facing call centers, they really have a better home with MAXIMUS, which allows us to focus on our core, enterprise IT, IT infrastructure and professional services and IT business solutions. On a going-forward basis, we, as you can expect, will continue to look for portfolio-shaping opportunities. However, I think we've made it pretty darn clear, our priority for capital deployment is we're going to draw down net debt, pay down net debt fairly expeditiously. So, you should think about that.
Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. So, Phebe, NORDAM, you took over the plant in early September, and you said that basically the orders were hurt because of uncertainty about delivery positions. Is it fully on track now? And, therefore, I assume you can offer firm delivery positions. And have we seen any pickup in orders? And what is the extent of the delay about, from the fact that they were kind of down for, what, 50 days or something without any production? Should we look for the first quarter to be a lot weaker than the rest of the year?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, look, you quite rightly point out that we now own a line, and I am always more comfortable when I can control my own destiny, particularly when it's in our sweet spot of operating excellence. So, as you can well imagine, Gulfstream has started up that line, stabilized the supply chain and we're in the process of sending nacelles to Gulfstream to support our G500 and G600 deliveries this year. We don't have a – we are not at full rate production, it takes a while at the nacelles, on the nacelle line, it takes a while to get that up, and you can be rest assured, we will get there and then have real clarity around – and specificity around delivery times. And yes, we've seen customers who are increasingly comforted and interested because we can now give them with greater assurity you're going to get your airplane on date certain. So I consider that all very wholesome. Can you repeat the last part of your question?
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: I think, so we've heard that it's like a one-month delay. Excuse me, a one quarter delay. So should we expect that Q1, you're kind of going to be up or are we going to see Q1 still being very, very depressed because of the recovery from NORDAM issues?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Okay. I understand now. So the way to think about this is that we are reducing the impact in terms of time, shortening the time span as we increase our production on the nacelle. So it's really too soon to tell, but I think we will be well-positioned to support pretty robust manufacturing of the G500 in Q1.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. On Marine, there's been a lot of discussion around the Navy about the need for a larger fleet, but also certainly the ability to fund the growth. And history has shown these growth plans can have a lot of uncertainty. Can you describe how you think about your capital investment plans for Marine? Huntington Ingalls has raised theirs even more. I mean, when do you decide to invest and when do you wait?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, yeah, the key in any capital deployment investment is to, as quickly as possible, marry in terms of time the capital expenditure with the return. And so the Navy understands that and has worked very closely through contract provisions to ensure that that happens. We've got $1.7 billion in our facilities master plan, not exclusively, but well, actually exclusively at Electric Boat. And there's another couple hundred million at the other two yards in order to support this increase in Navy shipbuilding. So I am quite comfortable that our – particularly at Electric Boat where the preponderance of the funding is deployed and will be deployed is appropriate, and timed well to support the Navy's construction. This is all pretty wholesome. We have got to prepare for the construction of this very, very large and important Columbia-class missile boat. And that's what we're doing right now.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So that's the main – would that be the main focus then? I guess what I'm getting at is the Columbia classes, we've said, is a very secure trajectory. Some other programs may be less so and...
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, look, I am capitalizing for the ships that I know that I'm going to compete in. We do not capitalize for programs that have yet to become programs of record and fully funded and supported by the U.S. Congress. That's not a wholesome business decision.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much, and good morning. So I noticed a nice pickup in the backlog in Mission Systems, and since there are a wider variety of smaller programs, I guess, in that segment. So, just as we think going forward maybe relative to investment account outlay growth over the next few years which is probably going to be mid or high-single digits, how should we think about the ability of Mission Systems to grow relative to that? And are there any of the pieces of the business, are there any of them that are much more positioned to outperform or underperform that level?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So in terms of cyber, EW and ground forces communications and networks, we are very well positioned on a going-forward basis. If you think about the backlog increase, we had an award of a very large contract for IDIQ for CHS-5. And then we also had a new line of business, Life Cycle Product Management (sic) [Life Cycle Product Line Management] contract from the Army. So those were all – those were both very important, and provides a platform for continued growth. As the Army re-capitalizes and innovates around its ground forces, networking and comms, we are in the sweet spot of that relationship with the Army. So look, a lot of – if you think about it, these very impressive win rates for high-cycle businesses are really driven by being a low-cost, high-quality producer with – undergirded by very strong intimacy with our customers to understand their needs so that we're bringing them the products and capabilities, frankly, irrespective of vendors that can best suit their needs.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: And, Gary, I'd like to afford the time for one last question, please?
Operator: And that question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.
Peter John Skibitski - Alembic Global Advisors: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Phebe, just a follow-up on Marine. There was some news over the summer about missile tube production issues from at least one of the suppliers and I think some people in D.C. feared it could negatively impact the whole program from a cost and schedule standpoint. So I just was wondering if you could maybe talk about that and if you think it'll impact the program or if it's a problem may be easily resolved.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So we have worked very closely with the Navy on ensuring that the issues are identified and resolved, and it has not had an impact on Columbia's schedule. But you raise tangentially an interesting point, and that is the readiness of the supply chain to support what is significant growth. And the U.S. Navy and the Congress have recognized that with an appropriation of about $450 million for precisely the purpose of supplier and Electric Boat production readiness. So you don't – you want to exercise that supply chain before you go into full rate production to identify any potential challenges, and we're in the process of doing that. This is a very important risk reduction effort that the U.S. Congress and the Navy have undertaken, and we are very pleased with it. So this is – more to come on that, all right?
Peter John Skibitski - Alembic Global Advisors: Good color.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Howard Rubel for any closing remarks.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you for joining us on our call today. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. I look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you. Bye.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2018 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. As you can discern from our more expansive press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $9.19 billion and net earnings of $786 million. We reported EPS of $2.62 per diluted share $0.17 a share better than the year ago quarter and $0.12 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year ago quarter revenue of $9.19 billion was up $1.51 billion or 19.7%. Of this number, approximately 3% represents organic revenue growth with the remainder coming from the acquisition of CSRA. Net earnings of $786 million were up $37 million or 4.9% on the strength of a $21 million improvement in operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate offset in part by higher interest expense. This was particularly impressive given the $70 million of one-time costs in the quarter related to the acquisition of CSRA but a little more on that from Jason in a minute. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Revenue was up $1.65 billion or 21.9% and operating earnings were up $80 million or 7.9% on the lower operating margins attributable to the $45 million of the $70 million one-time costs associated with the acquisition of CSRA reported as corporate operating earnings. The other $25 million was reported in other expense. Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. Revenue was up $1.61 billion or 10.6% against the first half of 2017 for the same reasons, both the acquisition of CSRA and organic growth. On the other hand, operating earnings were down $17 million burdened by the aforementioned $45 million of cost in connection with the CSRA acquisition and increased amortization. Earnings from continuing operations were up $73 million, a 4.8% increase. EPS was $0.33 better, a 6.7% increase. In short, we had a very good second quarter and first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations. The CSRA acquisition performed as expected. Impressively, the acquisition would have been accretive in the quarter absent the onetime period of costs associated with it. These onetime period of costs burdened EPS by $0.20 per share in the quarter. The acquisition will be accretive to EPS in the second half mostly in the fourth quarter. And again, Jason will give you a little bit more color on this in a moment. Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half and then I'll ask Jason for some comments on the CSRA acquisition cash, backlog, and taxes, before I conclude with some comments on the outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $386 million were $183 million and $35 million lower respectively, but consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin improved 10 basis points to an impressive 20.4%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $70 million and operating earnings were up $40 million on a 140 basis point improvement in operating margin. We enjoyed brisk order activity in the quarter. The dollar-based book-to-bill was a strong 1.3 to 1. This brings the book-to-bill to 1 to 1 for the first half and for the last 12 calendar months as well. One year ago at the end of the second quarter, the Aerospace funded backlog was $12.12 billion. At the end of this quarter, it was $12.19 billion. Total backlog is up from $12.24 billion to $12.34 billion. Total estimated contract value is up $14.15 billion to $14.63 billion. So as you can see, we have had very good order performance for a full year now. The 650 and 650ER led the way in the quarter. The interest in all of our products remains quite good. The demand signals in North America are very good and growing in Europe as well. We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early orders, contract discussions and our pipeline. In short, we expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. Book-to-bill should be 1 to 1 or better in the second half better than that in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter because of higher anticipated deliveries. However, we could do a bit better in the fourth quarter. As you know, the G500 was certified on July 20. This now paves the way for pilot training in the third quarter and deliveries commencing early fourth quarter with a few possibly in Q3. G600 flying continues to go well. We look forward to certification in the fourth quarter of this year. In May, we also closed the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. It adds to Jet's global footprint, demonstrating a willingness to invest in support of our customers in locations convenient to them. This business will be part of a Jet Aviation-Gulfstream strategy to support a joint service effort outside of the United States. Let me now turn to the defense side of the house. At the outset, let me say that the collective revenue of the defense businesses was up 7.1% over the year ago quarter excluding the impact of CSRA. Turning to the individual segments, Combat Systems had a very good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.53 billion was $120 million more than the second quarter last year, up 8.5%. Similarly, operating earnings were $236 million, up $11 million, or 5% over the second quarter of 2017. I should remind everybody that the second quarter of 2017 represented a 9% improvement over second quarter 2016 in revenue and almost 10% in operating earnings. So we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for two years now. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $94 million or 6.5% and operating earnings were up $12 million or 5.4%. For the first half, revenue was up $273 million, slightly in excess of 10% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were up $30 million or 7%. Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordnance and munitions portfolio. The Army continues to exploit the versatility of the Stryker with a $260 million contract in the quarter to upgrade the electronics, power and communications on the vehicle. This contract is part of the Army's plan to similarly upgrade all of their nine Stryker Brigades. We also received a $440 million order to upgrade Abrams tanks to the Version 3.0 configuration, which provides improved power, survivability and lethality. The continued monetization of our platforms in the coming years is, for the first time in a while, manifest in explicit program direction for the tank and the Stryker which puts us in good stead for continued growth. Our international programs continue to see nice growth as well. Work on the UK AJAX program is transitioning to production from engineering with peak production in 2021. We are obviously trending in the right direction at combat. It is a very nice growth story. With respect to the Marine segment, revenue of $2.17 billion was $89 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $17 million against the year ago quarter on a 40 basis point expansion in operating profit. Similar to Combat Systems, the 2017 quarter experienced nice growth in both revenue and earnings against the same quarter in 2016. So once again, two years of good growth. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $134 million and operating earnings were up $11 million at 6.6% and 6% respectively. For the first half, revenue of $4.2 billion was up $189 million or 4.7% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were also up by $40 million or 11.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin to 9%. Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia class construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine, continues to make good progress. We are building Virginia-class Block IV boats and have begun to purchase long lead material for the Block V. We expect the Block V contract to be awarded later this year. With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG-1000 boat and the DDG-51 restart ships are largely behind us with nice performance from the DDG-1001 and 1002 and on the follow on DDG-51 ships. We expect a multi-year contract to be awarded later this year for the DDG-51 Flight III upgrade. Finally, surface repair at NASSCO had a slower start than anticipated this year but will ramp up in the second half. In all, Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come. We are now reporting what was IS&T in two segments: first, Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and second, Information Technology, one of the industry's largest providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies, and federal civilian agencies. Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.15 billion in the quarter, an increase of $95 million or 9% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $153 million were steady against the second quarter last year as a result of a 120 basis point drop in operating margin due to program mix in the quarter. We expect that mix to improve in the second half. Mission Systems reports internally in three lines of business: ISR systems, communications, and platforms and sensors. Growth year-to-date for Mission Systems was primarily in ISR, in particular space payloads and encryption, and in communications. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $49 million and earnings were up $7 million. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $105 million or 4.9%. Once again, first half earnings were steady against the first half of last year. Mission Systems has been a good growth business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 in 2016, 2017 and the first half of 2018. Information Technology reported revenue of $2.44 billion in the second quarter. CSRA's contribution in the quarter was $1.29 billion. The revenue of Legacy GDIT was up $96 million or 9.1% excluding CSRA against the year ago quarter. Operating earnings were $156 million with a $72 million contribution from CSRA, which includes $62 million of an amortization charge as a result of the transaction. Margin was 6.4% versus 8.3% the year ago quarter as a result of CSRA intangible asset amortization. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was $3.58 billion, was up $1.4 billion. Importantly, revenue in the first half was up $176 million or 8.3% excluding the impact of CSRA. On a year-to-date basis, earnings were up $80 million or 45.2%. Operating margins of 7.2% compares with the first half of last year of 8.4% consistent with the second quarter results. Our integration of CSRA into GDIT is going well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team pulled from both businesses has gelled nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goal. The strength of GDIT post acquisition is in the experience of both GDIT and CSRA in developing cost effective solutions for its customers and leveraging this experience across multiple agencies. Both companies are excellent at transitioning old IT solutions to secure cloud-based solutions that are easier to operate and maintain. Together, we are even better. We expect this to be a competitive and powerful combination of talent and know how. So, in summary, in the quarter, General Dynamics accomplished a number of key strategic objectives and delivered solid operating results. We closed on the largest acquisition in GD's history, expanded Jet Aviation's service network in Australia and the Asia Pacific region, and grew earnings and backlog. I'll now turn the call over to Jason and then come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year.
Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the income statement and, in particular, the areas that are impacted by the CSRA acquisition. First, as Phebe noted, are the onetime transition costs we incurred associated with the acquisition. A portion of these costs, largely related to change of control provisions, are reported in our operating earnings as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, while the balance, legal, accounting, and other advisory fees, is reported in other income and expense. In the quarter, we recognized $45 million of transaction costs in corporate operating earnings and $25 million in other expenses below the line for a total of $70 million in the quarter. You'll recall, we recognized $5 million of these one-time fees and other expenses in the first quarter and we anticipate the final payments in the third quarter to bring us to a total transaction cost of $80 million or $0.23 per share. Including these onetime charges, we expect corporate operating costs and the other below the line expenses to each be approximately $25 million for the year. Turning to net interest expense, we reported $103 million in the quarter, compared to $24 million in the second quarter of 2017. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $130 million versus $49 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $355 million versus our initial pre-acquisition January guidance of $115 million. Wrapping up the discussion of CSRA, the second quarter numbers include provisional amounts related to purchase accounting for CSRA. Although, not final, we believe we have good estimates of the acquired intangible assets and the related amortization expense. These estimates are very much in line with what we reported in our recent 8-K filing associated with this transaction, which are approximately $2 billion of intangible assets and a $190 million of amortization for the nine months of 2018. Moving on from CSRA, our effective tax rate was 19% for the quarter which is consistent with our full year outlook. You'll recall, our first quarter tax rate was somewhat lower due to the timing of benefits associated with equity compensation deductions so the rate for the first half of the year was 17.9%. That quite naturally implies a rate higher than 19% for the balance of the year to net a full year rate of 19%. Turning to capital deployment, we paid $276 million in dividend in the second quarter. We also purchased 900,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.1 million shares for the first half of the year for $436 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Our focus for the balance of the year will be on paying down the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition, consistent with the near-term maturity structure that we established. We generated $787 million of cash from operations in the quarter and, after capital expenditures of $175 million, we have free cash flow of $612 million, a conversion rate of nearly 80%. That resulted in a net cash balance of $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter and a net debt position of $12.4 billion. For the year we expect free our cash flow to be in the low to mid 90% range reflecting our typical 100% conversion target, less the additional $255 million discretionary pension contribution that we discussed last quarter, which we paid in the third quarter. Lastly, a couple of highlights on our backlog. First, the addition of CSRA brought $5.3 billion of firm backlog to the company along with $8.5 billion of IDIQ and unexercised options, what we refer to as estimated potential contract value. In addition to this incremental backlog, the combined GDIT-CSRA had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 times in the quarter bringing them to 1.1 times for the first half of the year. And one last point regarding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations as it relates to backlog. While FX rates had a de minimis impact on our reported sales and earnings in the quarter, changes in the rates from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter reduced our Combat Systems and Mission Systems backlogs by approximately $370 million and $75 million respectively. Excluding this impact, these two groups had a book-to-bill in the quarter of 0.9 times and 1 to 1 respectively. In fact, our defense businesses in aggregate had a book-to-bill of 0.9 times in the quarter and first six months of the year and that includes a very lumpy Marine Systems where, as Phebe noted, we anticipate some very large additions to the backlog in the form of a multi-year DDG and Virginia Block V contract later this year. Combined with the strong order activity and ongoing environment that Phebe described in the Aerospace group, we're set up to continue what's developing as a very nice growth story. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you a wrap up including our updated guidance for the year.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment and compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion up $220 million to $270 million from 2017, operating earnings slightly in excess of $1.5 billion and operating margin of around 18%. We now expect revenue of approximately $8.6 billion, with earnings roughly consistent with our January forecast. This implies pressure on margins in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter when G500 deliveries begin in earnest. For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, up $200 million to $250 million from 2017 with operating earnings around $970 million on an operating margin of around 15.7%. We now expect revenue of $6.3 billion to $6.35 billion, operating earnings of approximately $990 million, with an operating margin around 15.5%, so approximately $150 million more revenue and $20 million more in operating earnings. For the Marine segment, we previously guided to revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, margins are at $8.7 billion and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We now expect revenue to be slightly over $8.5 billion with margins slightly better than the previous forecast resulting in operating earnings of $745 million to $755 million. For IS&T, we guided to revenue of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, up $400 million to $500 million from 2017, operating earnings of $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast for the two legacy businesses is between $9.4 million and $9.5 billion. Rather than taking it any further of the old IS&T level, let me break it into the new business segments. First, Mission Systems. Their outlook for this year is revenue between $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion with margins around 14%. This implies significant growth in revenue and earnings in the second half. Second, legacy GDIT will have revenue for the year of about $4.6 billion with margins around 8%. CSRA will add about $3.75 billion of revenue with operating margins growing 6%. So IT rolls up revenue of between $8.3 billion and $8.4 billion with operating earnings around $600 million and margins around 7%. So all of this sums to revenue for GD about $36.7 billion to $36.8 billion and operating margins somewhat in excess of 12%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $10.90 to $11 to a range of $11 to $11.05. This increased outlook overcomes what we expect to be a $0.23 per share negative impact from all the charges related to the CSRA acquisition. Apart from those fees and expenses, we expect CSRA's contribution to be $0.11 this year. The difference then is from GD operating improvement. With that, I'll turn it back to Howard and address your questions.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Rocco, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Absolutely, Sir. Today's first question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Ron.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I think one topic that's sort of in the back of everybody's mind, if you could maybe put some perspective on it is one of the suppliers on the G500 is having financial difficulty, filed for bankruptcy and they're a supplier to you, your supplier Pratt Canada, so the Northern Group. I mean, how should investors think about what potential impact that could have and what it means? Because we're just getting a lot of questions on it and I think people just want to get a sense on how you're thinking about that.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So the current issue will have some impact on our deliveries to some extent this year but it is solvable. Let's remember that the (34:30) as manufactured and designed was approved through the FAA certification process. We are confident in that the parties will expeditiously resolve their dispute. Let's also – I think it's important to remember, this is really a terrific engine. It's quiet, its performance is superior and its highly efficient. So we will get through this.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So basically, I guess, is there any way you can give a – how disruptive could it be or not? Just kind of that kind of thing. Like, Phebe, everybody sort of worries about these things when they come up. And we've seen them come and go in the past and in the end, it don't usually amount to much. But if you could give people comfort on that, that would really be helpful.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes, so this year, to the extent it affects some of the G500 deliveries, margins will go up and our earnings are going to be flat. So I'm pretty comfortable that we will get through this and the sooner we get through it, the better. But this is all solvable. And frankly, we can manage through this as can Pratt.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, okay, great. I'll leave it there and let someone else ask their question. Thank you.
Operator: And today's next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Hi, good morning, Phebe and Jason.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: I wanted to just ask a closely related two-parter here on G500, G600. You've commented recently about in the impact on margins there as we look forward to next couple of years and my understanding is that's some non-recurring cost that you have to layer in on those initial production lots. How long does that stretch in terms of time that those impacts will be there for the G500 and G600? And then secondly, you talked about the G500 weighing on margins in the fourth quarter on those initial deliveries. Do you still expect those deliveries to be profitable, but still just dilutive to the overall Gulfstream or Aerospace margin? Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes, they will be profitable. The first lot of airplanes tends to carry program costs that reduce margins. That said, we have always demonstrated superb operating performance in the manufacturing of our airplanes. So we will – as soon as we get through that, margins will ramp up very nicely on the G500 and G600.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: And does that happen in 2021?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: It'll happen before that. We've just got to get through a handful of the G500s and off we go.
Operator: And today's next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Phebe, you mentioned that demand for the G650 is still very strong. I was wondering if you could give us some idea of what the current lead time is on that aircraft. And previously, you indicated that you might want to bring production down on that model. Is that still the case?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So we have begun to ramp down production on the G650 and will continue to do so, the pace at which, however ,we're going to have to discern as we do our plans for 2019 because the order book has been so strong. So the G650 is doing frankly quite nicely. What was the first part of your question?
Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: The lead time, if I was to order one today.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: The lead time. So the lead times are well within our comfortable range of about 18 months. All of our airplanes are in a very comfortable range.
Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And today's next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, David.
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, Phebe. So I wanted to follow up. Jason made the comment about deleveraging from here. I guess you have $2.5 billion in commercial papers. So can you talk about the pace at which you plan to delever? And then also on cash conversion, you touched on kind of mid-90s this year. What should we think about going forward given the high amortization levels associated with CSRA? Thanks.
Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Hey, David. I think what you can expect in terms of deleveraging is that commercial paper that you see on the balance sheet that should be gone by the end of the year and you'll see call it roughly similar reductions for the next couple of years following that, all consistent with the maturities in our existing ladder. So that will all come as scheduled on maturity. With respect to free cash flow, we'll continue to target to be in the 90s to 100% range moving forward, all subject obviously as we've mentioned to investment for growth particularly in Marine Systems, but we'll continue to be in that 90s to 100% range as we look forward.
Operator: And today's next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much and good morning. I just wanted to go back to some comments, Phebe, that you made a little bit earlier in the year and make sure I understand them in detail. I thought that maybe for 2019 and 2020 we were going to be looking at the Aerospace margins coming down 200 to 300 basis points from the 2018 baseline. And I want to see if that's still the case and if not what's changed?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, look, our margins are going to be just fine. I'm not going to get into 2019 and 2020. That will all depend on our build rate, but we are going to be quite comfortable in our margin performance as we frankly always are at Gulfstream. So I wouldn't give that too much worry.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: There are going to be margin compressions because we got mix issue. That should be understood and fairly explicable. So we're in pretty good shape on that score.
Operator: And today's next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Phebe, you talked about the strong demand signals you're seeing in the market right now at Gulfstream. Could you give us a little more insight into how that goes by geography, customer type? And just have to ask, are you seeing any impact from the coming introduction of the new Bombardier models?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So our order book is heavily North America with strong European interest and some increase in the Asia Pacific region, pretty consistent with the way – to the previous patterns of the order activity. Across the portfolio, the order book tends to be divided roughly in thirds by private company's high net worth individuals and public companies. So, look, our backlog is very durable and we understand who's in it. Many of them have been longtime customers. And the order activity continues. I think I've told you before, we're not very concerned about that airplane. We continue to sell the G650 at a good rate and we have some compelling attributes not satisfied with the 7500, including better range at restricted airports and more range at speed. I'd recommend that perhaps some folks should do some product comparisons that could help illuminate our lack of concern on that score.
Operator: And today's next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. I was wondering, if you could talk a little about Combat Systems. Just trying to think about the balance as we go forward and I guess this is even beyond this year with the recapitalization in the U.S., which I typically think is somewhat lower margin, but also looks like we're seeing strength in European defense spending and how that plays out for ELS and just thinking about the margin mix and the growth as we go forward there.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So we're very comfortable with the growth estimates that we gave you for our long range plan back in January and that those estimates are undergirded by exactly the elements that you note. Interestingly, I have been watching the army for a very long time and under the leadership of Secretary Esper and General Milley, we've seen a focus on modernization to an extent that arguably hasn't been seen since the 1980s when the Army fielded the Big Five and they're budgeting their resources to support their modernization plan. They've also been working with industry very closely, which is very wholesome as we work to ensure that they get the best of class technologies and capabilities. So I'm very pleased with the demand signals coming out of the United States. The same is true in Europe. Our European Land Systems is growing at a nice rate and the book-to-bill in that whole business has been very wholesome. Combat, as I noted in my remarks, has been a growth engine for us for the last two years and will continue to be so. So, we like what we're seeing in Combat.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you so much. So yesterday when Lockheed Martin reported they had a substantial increase in their revenue guidance for this year and they were making the point that they're seeing DoD kind of put new business under contract sooner than they had expected and early flow-through of the large Omnibus add-ons in the FY 2018 budget. Are you seeing any of that because you look like you have relatively modest revenue hikes for this year? So...
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I thought we were...
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: ...are your numbers conservative?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I thought we were growing nicely. Hey, look, I don't know what...
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: I didn't say you weren't growing nicely, but it looks like – I mean, I'm just asking is this kind of a conservative number so it may have upside or is this kind of right down the fairway? How should we think about that?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I never comment on others. I can simply tell you that our revenue estimates are very consistent – today, are pretty consistent with where we were when we set this plan. We have a great deal of insight into our customers and their spend rates. And I think it's certainly in Marine, that's very steady predictable growth. Right? Combat is much the same way to the extent that we've seen some surprises, frankly, in the growth rate have been at CSRA and GDIT which grew very, very nicely. And we'll continue to do so and we've reflected that in our updated guidance. So no particular surprises here, frankly. We've been pretty forthright with you all on what we expected and that's what's happened and what is happening.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Yes. Good morning. Phebe, on Aerospace, the increase in revenues is primarily Hawker Pacific or were there additional deliveries? Could you provide what the updated deliveries might be? And then also on the margin with no G500 deliveries in the third quarter...
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Whoa, I didn't say no. Go ahead. Yeah. Go ahead.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay. Sorry about that. The increase in Aerospace guidance is primarily from the acquisition of Hawker Pacific or there're increased deliveries as well? And then second part of it is, with no G500 deliveries in Q3, you should have another strong margin, would imply that the fourth quarter margin would be 15% or less. I mean, is that a fair characterization? Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So as I mentioned to you, we may have a few G500 deliveries in the third quarter. We said consistently that that first lot of G500s is going to carry lower margin and our guidance to you reflects that. The increase in revenue is a combination of a lot of different elements in this very complex portfolio, Hawker, mix in deliveries, increased service, so across sort of the whole canopy (49:01) of levers that present in any given quarter. That is our best estimate right now. I'm pretty confident in it in terms of the revenue and the earnings, frankly.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay. I'll stick with the one question. Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, George.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Joe DeNardi of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Phebe, I was wondering if you could talk about Marine longer term and what your expectations are there from a margin standpoint and what your mix of work is going to be on Columbia versus Virginia class, what your current line of thinking there is? Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So think about large shipbuilding programs and businesses is typically having margins in the 8% to 10% range depending on the maturity of the program. So that's the prism through which we should look at the Marine Group. That said, as we ramp up on Columbia, we will see some margin compression quite naturally because that will be cost plus work. And given the long duration of the shipbuilding contracts and the shipbuilding process itself for any one of these single submarines, that margin compression can obtain for a while offset, of course, by increased improvements in our Virginia class performance which we have historically shown. So I don't have a good estimate right now for you of the out year estimate on the mix between Virginia and Columbia. Columbia will, in seven or eight years, completely dwarf or heavily dwarf Virginia. So it's simply because of the volume coming into the yard. Think about it this way, we start manufacture of that first Columbia in 20 and then it will ramp up pretty expeditiously through the next four or five years. So we'll be able as we – I think I mentioned from time ago, we signed last year a detailed design contract. Part of that contract is a detailed plan that we worked out with the Navy on exactly the sequencing of the requirements and the build strategy and the funding to go along with that. Once we get that ironed out in the next year and a half to two years, then we'll have quite a bit of clarity on exactly what this very long range program looks like.
Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Phebe, just on CSRA, it sounds like it's nicely accretive. Can you maybe update your thoughts on how you're thinking about still the synergies? And I know there's some costs that you get to hold on or some cost reduction you get to hold on to and some you give back. But how are you thinking about that now that you've had the business for a few months?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So our costs and savings have baked into our estimates for the year. And with respect to CSRA, our integration is going very, very well. We're right on target, in fact, a little ahead of schedule. I suspect we will continue to see increased synergies over time. The beauty of putting these two businesses together is we can take the best-in-class out of GDIT in the best-in-class out of legacy CSRA and really marry those capabilities for some pretty impressive performance in the marketplace. The combined GDIT under the new GDIT has had a 75% win rate this year. That is pretty darn impressive for a highly competitive business. So I think that speaks to the power of the combination of these two businesses.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. And thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: Good morning. Just sticking on CSRA, can you maybe elaborate how we should think about retention rates for that business whether it's the employee base or just contract renewals? And Phebe, if you could just expand a little bit about the integration targets you mentioned.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So we have added about $900 million in this quarter alone to – over $900 million in our backlog on the combined contracts. With respect to employees, we have retained every single employee that we have wanted to retain. And the beauty of this integration is that we're taking the management team of CSRA and the management team of GDIT and we have melded it into a very, very effective, cohesive management team with a vision on how they want to proceed. They are melding the two cultures. They are bringing the best-in-class technical capabilities in each business and the customer intimacy in each business. So we're very pleased with our employee retention. We've had super contract generation. There have been frankly no surprises or disappointments in any of the contract activity since the acquisition. It's interesting, just to give you a little bit of perspective on this. GDIT grew 9% and, for the quarter, CSRA grew 12.6% and that's the particularly impressive given their 9% growth in the quarter prior to the acquisition. These businesses are doing extremely well.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: So we'll take one last question, operator.
Operator: Absolutely. Our last question comes from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. I don't know if this is, Phebe, for you or Jason, but I wanted to try and get at normalized margins in Aero and in GDIT just given the somewhat unusual moving pieces in the back end of the year here. So while I know you don't want to talk about 2019, once we get past this early lot of G500s and I'd ask you how many aircraft are in that lot. How do we think about it? Does Aerospace get back to a 20% margin whenever that time is? And then similar question on GDIT, how do we think about normalized margins there? Can CSRA get back to legacy GD levels or even higher?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah, Jason will address that.
Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Let me take the CSRA, GDIT side. I think the way we're looking at it is if you adjust for the amortization impact, the incremental amortization from the transaction, CSRA is actually contributing margins consistent with their historic performance, double-digit performance and is accretive to the margins of the group, again ex that amortization. And a point on that, I noted in the remarks that we had – we're anticipating $190 million of amortization this year for the CSRA transaction. Under the accounting rules, that's actually an accelerated message. So we'll have $190 million for the nine months of this year followed by, I think, it's 200 million next year and then it'll ratchet down over time. So you'll see that in a little more detail in the 10-Q we'll publish later today. But that will, I think, help you sort of model impacts on margin rates, if you think of core CSRA contribution ex amortization in the double-digit range consistent with their history. So that's sort of the story on the GDIT side.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: On Gulfstream, so one of the things that you should by now think about us as a superb operating company. So we'll get through the initial lot, fairly expeditiously and you may ask the number in that lot, but I don't intend to tell you. And then begin our ramp down our learning curve. We've got synergies between the G500 and G600 lines because they are coproduced in the same facility. I'm not going to be predictive of how good can we get in the out years. But you can believe year in and year out, we will improve our performance on our airplanes.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe and Jason, and everybody else who was listening today. This ends our call. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. With that, we look forward to talking to you later today and in the days ahead. Goodbye.
Operator: Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Chad, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter 2018 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Howard, and good morning. I intend to keep my remarks on performance in the quarter somewhat brief since the results are relatively straightforward, pretty solid, and the comparisons generally attractive. I will, however, spend more time providing color around the business segments, and IS&T and Aerospace in particular. For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $2.65 on revenue somewhat in excess of $7.5 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion, and net earnings of $799 million. All of the numbers that I'm about to give you with reference to the first quarter 2017 for comparison purposes are restated for the adoption of accounting standard update 2017-07 with respect to the presentation of retirement benefit costs. So compared to the first quarter of 2017, revenue was up $94 million or 1.3%, and operating earnings were down $38 million or 3.6% over the prior year's quarter. The operating margin in the quarter was at 13.4%. It was very good but did not compare favorably to last year's stellar first quarter of 14.1%. On the other hand, net earnings at $799 million were up $36 million, or 4.7%, on the strength of a lower provision for income taxes. EPS of $2.65 was $0.17 or 6.9% better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 better than consensus. We estimate that about half of that $0.15 beat was from operations in the form of higher than expected operating margin, and the remainder came from a lower than expected tax rate. Now let me provide some additional granularity for you. Our three Defense segments posted very strong revenue growth of $343 million or 6.4% over the year-ago quarter. The same was true with respect to earnings. The Defense segment's earnings grew $53 million or 8.8%. Each of the Defense groups grew both revenue and earnings over the year-ago period, demonstrating what we believe will be strong growth in our defense businesses across the board. This leads quite naturally to a discussion of the Aerospace group. Revenue in the quarter was $1.82 billion and earnings were $346 million. Aerospace revenue was down $249 million or 12%, and earnings were down $93 million or 21.2% on a 220 basis point contraction in margin. These earnings were consistent with our guidance and pretty much as anticipated by consensus. It would appear that Aerospace was somewhat lower on revenue but higher on earnings than consensus. In fact, we had planned to deliver two more aircraft in the quarter, a special mission G550 and a G280. They were ready and scheduled for delivery in the quarter, but were delayed for the convenience of the customer. The G280 delivered during the first week of April. The G550 will deliver in May to allow additional customer changes. If we had managed those deliveries as planned, we would have been consistent with or slightly ahead of revenue expectations. It was kind of difficult to work deliveries during Easter week. The same could be said for completing orders during that week. Nevertheless, Aerospace is right on plan for earnings and modestly behind on revenue, which will be caught up. It was a simple timing problem on two deliveries. It is also well to remember that our plan for revenue is back-end loaded with deliveries of G500 in the second half. Orders for the group were reasonably typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders were about $1.4 billion, and the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.8-to-1. This is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2013 through 2017. The Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter over the last five years were $1.4 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7. So it was a quarter with strong sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a very strong fourth quarter. I should also note that the activity has been good in April, with evidence of strong interest in North America and a growing opportunity set in Europe. The reports from our people who attended the Asian Business Aviation Air Show were that the talk of Chinese tariffs on business jets was more of a media discussion. It has not caused any deal discussions to stop. In fact, it may have stimulated some near-term activity. The Chinese customers believe that the question of tariffs will be resolved. Other than that note of caution, we are optimistic about the market and our sales activity. With respect to product development, our G500 continues to mature, moving closer to final certification this summer and entry into service only a few months after the original EIS we announced four years ago. As you know, we have pursued simultaneous FAA and EASA certification requirements. We have now completed key supplier component-level tests, which expanded the program as we developed configurations to meet regulatory requirements. This work is now behind us. This work coupled with the G500 and G600 range enhancement testing has added to our total program time, but produced outstanding results. We have recently completed tests for flights into known icing and high field elevation. We have begun the last phase of our flight testing, known as function and reliability testing. The 300-hour function and reliability testing will complete the flying portion of the program. The program will then shift to final document approval by the FAA. To date, we have submitted 98% of the final certification documents to the FAA for review. We expect certification in June or July. We will begin pilot training with FlightSafety in August and commence deliveries later this year. We remain on plan to meet our 2018 G500 planned customer deliveries. This new technology aircraft with active control sidesticks, touchscreen displays, and fly-by-wire continues to exceed our expectations. As we progress closer to G500 certification, our testing has logged more than 4,000 hours. The G600 is benefiting from all of these efforts and will wrap up its certification in the second half of 2018. We will begin deliveries of the G600 in 2019. Our service business at Gulfstream remains strong, with very nice growth in the quarter and strong margins. Second quarter loading is solid. We expect solid performance for the year in this business, which is in excess of $1 billion in annual revenue. We look forward to concluding the recently announced Hawker Pacific acquisition for Jet Aviation. It's a very strategic acquisition for Jet and simultaneously helpful to Gulfstream in places where it does not have standalone Gulfstream support facilities. Now let me turn to the Defense side of the business, starting with Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, sales at $1.44 billion were up $153 million or 11.9%, and operating earnings of $224 million were up $19 million or 9.3%. There was strong performance across the board in each one of the three businesses within this group. Sequentially, revenue was down $308 million, but operating earnings were down only $36 million on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is a particularly difficult comparison on a revenue basis. This group always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries at the end of the year. With respect to the demand environment, the U.S. Army continues to fund readiness, which includes significant upgrades to our major weapon platforms, the Stryker and the Abrams main battle tank. We are also seeing increases in funding for our munitions products, both domestically and internationally. Internationally, our European-based business continues to have nice order activity throughout Europe and into parts of Africa. Given Combat's large backlog, they still had nice order activity in the quarter of 1-to-1. Funded backlog of $17.1 billion was down only $32 million against the fourth quarter of 2017 and $68 million against the year-ago quarter, all in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems. Turning to IS&T, this is going to be the last quarter we report to you in this particular format. I will do so here, give you some numbers for the individual companies that make up the group, and then ask Jason to make some forward-looking statements that we think will be of assistance to you. IS&T had revenue of $2.24 billion. That is $90 million or 4.2% more than the year-ago quarter. Earnings followed suit. Operating earnings of $247 million were $11 million or 4.7% better than the year-ago quarter. The operating margin of 11% was the same in both quarters. Book-to-bill was once again about 1-to-1. These results were very consistent with consensus. IS&T total backlog has remained relatively constant over the past year. At $8.8 billion, it is up $94 million against the year-ago quarter and down $60 million sequentially. Funded backlog at $6.74 billion is up $57 million against the year-ago quarter and sequentially, so a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective. Now to help get everybody on the same page, let me break down the revenue, operating earnings, and operating margins in the quarter for each of the two businesses that made up IS&T, which will be reported separately going forward. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.1 billion, operating earnings of $134 million, and an operating margin of 12.2% in the quarter. GDIT had revenue of $1.14 billion, operating earnings of $99 million, and our operating margin of 8.7% in the quarter. At this point, I'd like to turn to Jason to interject some comments about dividing the guidance we had given you in January for IS&T into each of the businesses, and then comment on the impact of CSRA on GDIT for the year.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: As Phebe discussed, starting in the second quarter, we'll report the two IS&T businesses, Mission Systems and GDIT, separately. To give you a sense of how to think about that, let me start with how those businesses comprise the original guidance we gave you for IS&T for the year. For the full year, we expected IS&T revenue in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. Mission Systems represents slightly more than half of those revenues, between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, while GDIT is approximately $4.5 billion of that forecast. From a margin perspective, you can think about Mission Systems in the 13% to 14% range and GDIT in the high single-digit range, around 8%. So with that as a baseline, how does CSRA impact GDIT for the year? We closed the transaction on April 3, so we'll have three quarters of the year with the combined company. We expect that to add approximately $3.6 billion in sales for the year. The impact of the combined GDIT margins and the company's bottom line EPS will depend on the outcome of our purchase price allocation to intangible assets and the resulting amortization, which we'll have a better sense of this quarter and report to you on our second quarter call. But at a macro level, we expect that after the one-time charge associated with the cost to compete this transaction, which will be approximately $80 million and be taken as a discrete item in the second quarter, CSRA will be breakeven to slightly accretive to our GAAP earnings per-share starting in the third quarter.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. Finally, let's turn to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.03 billion was up $100 million or 5.2% against the year-ago quarter. Importantly, revenue was up in each of the three shipyards. Earnings were $184 million, a $23 million or 14.3% increase against the first quarter 2017. Just like the revenue story, earnings were up in all three shipyards. The earnings performance was driven by a 9% operating margin, a 70 basis point improvement over first quarter 2017. Sequentially, revenue was down $26 million or 1.3%, but earnings were up $17 million, a strong 10.2% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. The backlog story here is very strong. Total backlog at $23.8 billion is down $451 million sequentially, but funded backlog is up over $2.4 billion. This is on the strength of $1.6 billion in orders in the quarter. Electric Boat is continuing to work on its 27th Virginia-class submarine, and we are deep into the final engineering phase on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. We began material purchases early this year to support construction on the first ship for Columbia, forecast to begin full construction in 2020. Bath is working down its learning curve on the restart DDG-51s and delivered the second DDG-1000 yesterday. The last of the three DDG-1000s delivers in 2020. NASSCO continues its strong performance on each of its class of Navy and commercial ships. So the company is off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. The first quarter should be received as a constructive building block to a good year. We do not as a practice change guidance of the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve our results. I'd now like to turn the call back to Jason for additional remarks about taxes, pension, and cash.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Phebe, and good morning. First, a couple points on the income statement, starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $25 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the slightly higher interest rate on the debt we refinanced late last year. You'll note we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding in addition to the $4 billion of fixed-rate notes we had at the end of the year. That CP was drawn in anticipation of the CSRA acquisition. We had other expense in the quarter of $21 million compared with $11 million in the first quarter of last year. This reflects the adoption of a new accounting standard that Phebe alluded to, ASU 2017-07, which requires us to report the non-service cost portion of our pension expense in other income and expense. That's what you see reflected in the quarter, and the 2017 numbers have been adjusted for a comparable reporting. This new rule is nothing more than a modification to the geography of our pension income and expense on the income statement, no impact to the aggregate amount of income or expense. One more point on the subject of pensions, we noted on our fourth quarter earnings call that we were considering making additional pension contributions this year in light of the benefits afforded by the recent tax reform. After finalizing this analysis, we are now planning to make approximately $550 million in pension contributions this year, up from our original plan of $300 million. That $250 million increase will, of course, impact our operating cash forecast, which I'll touch on in just a minute. But before I go there, one more point on the income statement, our effective tax rate was 16.8% for the quarter. While our full-year tax rate guidance was 19%, the lower first quarter rate was anticipated in that guidance based on the timing of divesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefit. So the lower rate in the quarter is consistent with our full-year tax rate forecast, which remains unchanged at 19%. Of course, with the lower first quarter rate, you can impute a slightly higher than 19% rate for the balance of the year to end up with 19% for the full year. On the capital deployment front, we paid $250 million in dividends and spent just shy of $270 million to repurchase 1.2 million shares of our common stock in the quarter. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying our remaining free cash flow to pay down our short-term borrowings used to acquire CSRA. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $2.1 billion, including the $2.5 billion of commercial paper I mentioned earlier. On the subject of cash, our operating activities used cash of roughly $500 million in the quarter. This reflects the timing of payments from customers and two suppliers and doesn't affect our full-year outlook for cash from operations, which remains unchanged but for the additional pension contributions I discussed earlier, and of course, the addition of CSRA, which we'll give you more granular sense of when we update our full-year guidance in July. Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question, so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Chad, could you just remind participants how to enter the queue, please?
Operator: Certainly. The first question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Hey, good morning, all.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Just a quick question on the Aerospace margins in the quarter. Just given the work you've got going on and a little bit of concurrency (00:21:10) on the G500, is there anything we should note in terms of additional R&D expense or intra-period expense that we should consider there?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes, so the margins in the quarter were driven by a couple of things, productivity in our large cabins. We had improved margin in our services due to mix at Gulfstream, and net R&D was down somewhat sequentially from fourth quarter of 2017.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt McConnell of RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you, good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So the CSRA contribution of about $3.6 billion, it looks like that would be down a bit versus what CSRA did in the comparable period, the three-quarter period in the prior year. And they've been guiding to organic growth, plus they have a couple small deals in there. Can you just share what you're seeing in that business? Am I correct that that would be a little bit of a year-over-year revenue decline for CSRA?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: There are actually a couple of moving parts in the there. First, we do have, and I believe we've discussed before a little bit of OCI business that we've got to divest of, and we're in the process of making that happen now. So that will take a little bit out of the top line number you're referring to. The other element of it is, of course, CSRA was on a fiscal year ending March 31. So if you look at the pattern of their revenue, it was at its peak in their fourth quarter. So when we talked about the first full year of guidance and they talked about their next year's guidance, that went the nine months of this year that we'll have them plus the first quarter of next year. So when you normalize for that seasonality in their revenue curve, the numbers we're projecting are right on with the previous estimates you heard from them.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, David.
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Phebe, I wanted to ask you about the fiscal 2018 budget. It looks like all of your key programs were well funded, particularly on the Combat Systems side. Can you talk about the upside that you guys saw in the budget relative to what you were thinking and what that might mean for your longer-term forecast for Combat because I don't think you had baked in there much for U.S. Army recapitalization? Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Actually, given that we're so close to our customer, we had anticipated their funding increases, both in the readiness counts, which we see in our OTS munitions line, and then upgrades to our major platforms, Stryker and Abrams. So there was no particular surprise in 2018 beyond what we had anticipated. We get insight into the budget deliberations relatively early on and had planned accordingly. So Stryker and Abrams in particular are doing quite well, and we're nicely funded in the budget and consistent with what we anticipated, so no real surprises, which is exactly what you want.
Operator: The next question will be from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, thank you so much. So, Phebe, in the past, you've talked about the problems with the G650 doing the completions before cert and all the problems that caused. And you said you wouldn't start completions until you receive the cert. What does that imply for the deliveries in the remainder of the year? And I assume that means mid to late fourth quarter because it takes, what, four to six months for initial completions. And secondly, now that you're approaching the cert, are we likely to see the orders pick up as you can take customers flying with you? Thanks so much.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So the G650 was a different case. We had built a fair number of green airplanes and had considerable FAA regulatory changes that we had to make. That pattern has not repeated here. This was a very mature program. Having run through all of our tests, frankly, the changes that we've made to the original aircraft have all been manageable. So with respect to timing, where in the G650 we had a delay from cert to delivery, we don't expect that in this case. We'll be ready to go with only some minor changes and very manageable on the G500s that we've got in service and, frankly, that we'll deliver. Frankly, our order activity has been quite nice. We're well over 50 orders on the G500 and close to that on the G600. So our deliveries will be backward-loaded, but really think the second half, not the fourth quarter. They will come pretty quickly coming off the line, all right?
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes.
Operator: The next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Phebe, can you update deliveries for the year at Gulfstream? Now you had been saying you would deliver a few less G650s. But given that the G500 is going to deliver a little bit later, are we going to still see somewhat less G650s or not as much? Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: We're not changing in the midst of our build plan at all. We have exactly the same number of G650s that we had anticipated. We're not moving off of our deliveries. We'll be right in that range, maybe one or two, depending on customer preferences. The G500, the couple of month delay we've had in certification from our original estimate has really had no – zero impact on our deliveries forecast for 2018.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Next up is Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Phebe, a question just I guess sticking on Gulfstream. Maybe you could just update us. You highlighted that you've had exactly what you planned in terms of order activity for the first quarter, and you had a really strong fourth quarter. But maybe we're four or five months into this tax reform. Are you seeing any differences between domestic and international? Maybe just give us some color on what you're seeing on end demand.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So the demand in Gulfstream is quite nice, and I think you quite accurately posited that tax reform has certainly helped. We have very strong order activity in North America and increasingly strong in Europe, by the way. But we attribute our North American order activity to a number of factors, our long-term customers replenishing their fleet as well as the incremental benefit to cash flow from tax reform; so frankly, all salutary impact for us.
Operator: The next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Can you talk a little bit about free cash flow? I know some of it is timing. But it seems like across the board, whether it's unbilled, receivables, payables, inventory, cash flow seemed weak. How much was the G500 delay in there? And I know you mentioned the higher pension. If we ex the higher pension, could you still get to the 100% conversion? And lastly, if you can talk about how CSRA impacts cash, that would be helpful.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Okay. So I think the bottom line is with respect to the cash in the quarter, as you pointed out, it's a variety of the working capital accounts, but it really is nothing more than timing. It's payments from customers and payments to suppliers that, frankly, was largely profiled for the quarter. We anticipated a softer first quarter this year within the forecast we originally gave you. Part of that is the continued build at Gulfstream. But again, nothing outsized or outside of our original plans. So all of that is par for the course and everything we expected in the first three months of the year. We did have a billing system implementation in a business unit that had caused a catch-up, and that has already been caught up in the month of April, so we're back on track there. So I feel very good about the cash forecast we gave you. As it relates to pension contributions, we really don't think about it in this point in terms of free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income. Because as we talked about, that's a metric. That 100% number is a metric that it's interesting to talk about. But in a period of growth and investment in the company, I think it's more constructive to talk about the strength of our operating cash conversion and then how we're going to deploy operating cash for the growth of the company. So as I said, everything remains consistent with our original plan from an operating cash generation standpoint. CSRA will contribute nicely to that. There's a number of factors that obviously have to be finalized. We've had that business now closed for about three weeks, so we're still closing the books on their fiscal 2018 and working out the finer details of the implications of that for the year. But I think suffice it to say right now, the cash accretion we anticipate from CSRA is looking to be better than what we modeled in our valuation and deal forecast when we came through due diligence. So I feel bullish about the contribution they'll make for us this year.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Remember, one of our rationales for both liking IT services and buying CSRA is that IT services companies have very strong cash conversion, and CSRA will add nicely to it.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning, Phebe.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Ron.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: A quick question for you. It seems like some of your suppliers on the G500 program have struggled to meet the targets that you need for delivery for you guys. Could you expand at all on what has been the difficulty in the supply chain?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: We've had very few issues with any of our key suppliers. I will not discuss our suppliers' supply chain. I think you got some color on that from the UTC call yesterday, but our suppliers have done a good job managing their supply chain and will continue to do that. So frankly, our supply chain is geared up nicely to support our expected deliveries on our new airplanes as well as continue to perform on our existing air fleet.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So you're comfortable from here forward that everything is stable?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes, we are. We're going to enter into service, as I told you, on the G500, and the G600 to follow not long thereafter, and the supply chain supports that.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So, Phebe, you mentioned Bath briefly in your prepared remarks, and you noted some of the milestones on the destroyers up there and some progress on the learning curve. But recently, the Navy still seems to suggest that this is your one yard with operational upside. So I was wondering if you could give us some more detail on how the learning curve progresses from here and how the margins might benefit from that, especially as you continue to mature on the Flight III DDG-51.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So the margin performance on the DDG-1000 program has been quite nice, with excellent ship-over-ship learning. Our performance on the restart, starting with the DDG-116, has proceeded according to our plan, and we are continuing to see learning and improvements on hull-over-hull. And we have a number of Flight IIAs still in the queue. Our work on the Flight III, which we got appropriated and contracted with us late last year, continues to go very well. We're in detailed design and the early stages of the manufacturing work papers. And again, our learning on the hull continues nicely apace. So that shipyard has had some issues, which we've talked about in the past. But we are comfortable that is largely behind us, and we're going to continue to do well as we go forward on what are really legacy platforms for us after we got that line restarted from a dead stop.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Is there any way to quantify what margins would look like in Marine once that yard is back where you want it?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: That's going to be a complicated question because you've got an increased mix in Columbia, which will be cost-plus through the duration of our plan period and then into the next as we move from our engineering and detailed design into the early phases of construction and full weight (36:05) construction. So our margins are going to bop around, and I'd say anywhere between the 8% and 10% on any given quarter, depending on the mix of Columbia. It's a cost-plus work in the middle of it. So that rather dwarfs incremental improvement. That said, we expect our shipyards to get better quarter after quarter, and Bath is doing precisely that.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey, good morning, guys.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey, Phebe, can you talk more about Aerospace's continued drive into the biz jet aftermarket? I think you announced a bunch of service center expansions in Savannah and Appleton, Van Nuys, either during the quarter of after, and then of course, the Hawker deal. Just wondering, is this you guys just trying to get more access to your own jets, or does the market growth seem really strong? And number two, are these moves dilutive or accretive to overall Aerospace margins?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: You mean the service business in general?
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Right.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Okay, so look, as our fleet has grown and flying hours have increased, it is incumbent upon us to increase our services to our customers. Our customers expect Gulfstream service and the excellence implied with Gulfstream service, and we're delivering it. So we anticipate continued growth in that market as our fleet increases. And frankly, while on any given quarter, the service margins – let's just talk about Gulfstream for a second – may be slightly dilutive to new airplane margins, they are very fulsome. And the margins at service really depend on a number of things, the loading at the service centers and the mix. So it tends to move around a fair amount, but we really like this business. And it's key to continuing to satisfy our customer needs. So we're going to expand it and expand it accordingly. With respect to Jet Aviation, we have added service capacity, again to support Gulfstream's expanded footprint, particularly outside the United States, where Gulfstream doesn't have an existing capability. So in the case of the Hawker acquisition, we added six FBOs, 14 maintenance facilities, and over 400,000 square feet of hangar space. So again, this is all in an attempt to support Gulfstream sales as our fleet increases, and I think we're doing that quite nicely and quite deliberatively. By the way, this aircraft services business is a relatively low-risk business. And if you think about Jet Aviation, I like our service business because it is low risk and very nice margins and great cash flow, so all good from that perspective.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you, good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I'm interested now that we're getting close to the G500 and then the G600 coming out. When you look over the next few years where you see G650 demand going, deliveries going, how do you see that trending? You've got the Global 7000 coming out. You've got your G600. Do you see either of those as having an effect on your rate for the G650?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: In neither instance. Look, I don't pay much attention to other people's airplanes, but the G650 sales have been very fulsome. We continue to anticipate that that airplane will sell. It has an important market that frankly can't be satisfied by any other airplane in terms of speed and range and the success of that platform. And the G600 is in a completely different market space. So we think as we designed these airplanes and thought about the replacement of our legacy G450 and G550, each one of these airplanes fits a very different kind of mission. So we think this is all additive and not an issue for the G650.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Do you see the trend line here as – do you see it as being a pretty stable delivery outlook over the next few years then for the G650?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I do. Recall, however, that we were going to, as we feathered in G650 deliveries to cover the decrease in the G450 and the elimination of the G450 line and then low rate production on the G550, we will begin to take a few out over the next few years on a general float, consistent with what we told you I think at your conference two years ago.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Phebe, actually if I could just follow up on that last question from Doug, recognizing that you want to focus on your own portfolio and not on others, as you mentioned, the Global 7000 is pretty significant competitor...
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: In your opinion. That is a hypothesis. It remains to be seen.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's really my question.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Frankly, I don't look at anybody else's airplanes because it's our business to sell our airplane into our market, and we've been very successful at that.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Right, so that's really my question. Is it a competitive aircraft? Certainly just looking high level at specification and price range, it looks that way. And so I was hoping you could elaborate on what the differences are, what your customers say the differences are that allow it to drive them to actually be more different than they can appear on the surface.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Wow, you have an airplane that has been in service now since 2012. That's five years. We have 400 in service now, and nobody else is a competitor airplane. And it remains to be seen whether the Global 7000 is an issue at all for Gulfstream, but we have not lost a single sale to date to the Global 7000. So again, I think you all can worry about that to your hearts' content. But the fact of the matter is this is a very, very effective airplane with a capability set in range and speed that has proven unequal. So we worry about what we control and what we see, so all good for the G650.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: All right, operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Sure. And that question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much and good morning. Maybe just a quick few partly related to the CSRA deal. Can you talk a little bit about the JEDI [Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure] contract and potentially what that means for CSRA and how CSRA may or may not be involved? And then, Jason, can you talk about what the ongoing interest expense is going to be once the deal is done?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. CSRA won the milCloud contract and anticipates teaming with a number of our traditional teammates as we look at JEDI. But milCloud will have to be an important part of whatever happens with conversion of the overarching DOD network. So we're comfortable where we are. We've got strong partnerships in place from our folks who live in the IT services business today and some non-traditional. By the way, the "non-traditional" guys have been with us for years, so I see this as well within our normal experience set. But we'll see, we'll see as it all comes out. I think the contract is due out sometime in the next couple of months, and we'll see how all that shakes out.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: And as it relates to your question on interest expense, that's one of the moving parts that we have to pin down. We obviously haven't gone to the market for that yet. That will occur next month. And once we do that, that will be part of the factors that will allow us to give you a more granular sense of the bottom-line impact of the deal. Right now, what we're seeing in terms of our pulse of the market and the rates we're seeing out there, it's all consistent and well within the parameters we established when we priced the deal. So we're very comfortable with where that is right now.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you very much.
Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Operator, with that, we'll end the call. Thank you all very much for joining us today. And if you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you again.

Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Howard A. Rubel: Thank you, Denise, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full-year 2017 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
A - Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning. We are very pleased to have Howard joined our senior leadership team. Thank you, Howard. Earlier today we reported fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.10 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.28 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $636 million. This result was impacted by a charge arising from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The adverse impact was a $119 million and is reflected in an increased tax provision. Adjusting to exclude the impact of this one-time event, we had earnings from continuing operations of $755 million and adjusted EPS per fully diluted share of $2.50. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were up $175 million over the year ago quarter. Similarly, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.61. You can find a more fulsome explanation of this in exhibits A and B of our press release. I suspect you will see a lot more this as other aerospace and defense companies report as you’ve already seen in other market segments. Revenue and operating earnings were up significantly against the year-ago quarter by 8.1% and 34.6%, respectively. So, all in all, a solid quarter with good performance all-around. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.56 on revenue of $38.97 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.9 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of tax reform, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.95 and earnings from continuing operations of $3.03 billion. Revenue from the year was up over 2016 by $412 million or 1.3%. Operating earnings were up $443 million or 11.9% on an 130 basis point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations were up $233 million or 8.7% as reported. Adjusted for the impacts of the tax Reform Act charge, earnings from continuing operations were up $352 million, a double-digit increase of 13.1%. All in all, 2017 was a very good year leaving us well-positioned for 2018. Perhaps the most important story in the quarter was the cash performance. Free cash flow from operations was $1.84 billion in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow of $3.45 billion. We advised you at the beginning of the year that free cash flow is going to be approximately 100% in net earnings. In fact, it was significantly better than that. Further, we enjoyed $1 billion reduction in operating working capital in the quarter as milestone payments were received at Land Systems and cash deposits were received at Gulfstream. Of note, the cash performance throughout our planning horizon should be very strong. We have a lot to cover this morning, including guidance, so I will view the year in the quarter as adjusted on a year-over-year basis for the groups without reference to the sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis suffice it to say that we had more revenue and more operating margin. This resulted in operating earnings and earnings from continuing operations that were very similar across all four quarters. Let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, aerospace. Revenue was up against the year-ago quarter by 1. -- $157 million or 8.6% and operating earnings were up $66 million or 24.1%. The result of a 220 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the full-year, revenue of $8.13 billion was up $314 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.59 billion were up $186 million, a strong 13.2% advance on a 160 point improvement in operating margins. In sum, an outstanding year at aerospace with strong operating leverage and very good order intake, particularly in the fourth quarter. This time last year we told you to expect revenue between $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate between 19.1 to 19.2. At year-end, we had higher-margins on somewhat lower revenue driven entirely by negligible pre-owned aircraft sales. By the way, we work really hard to avoid pre-owned sales, because they carry no margin. On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good and pipeline activity was robust. The book-to-bill at aerospace in the fourth quarter was $1.3 to $1 denominated and $1.4 to $1 in units. Let me give you some additional data on the subjects as it relates to the quarter and the year. At Gulfstream, net orders were up over 20% year-over-year. Within that increase, midsize orders were exactly the same as last year. Net large cabin orders were up almost 30%. Most importantly, on a growth basis, G650 and 650ER orders were up 78% year-over-year. This was the best G650, 650 ER order quarter since 2014 when we had a quarter with a number of multi-aircraft customers. It is also the second best quarter for the G650 and 650 ER since in orders terms since the launch in 2008. So we had a nice increase in large cabin orders led by the 650 and 650 ER. As we speak, there are over 280 of these aircraft in service with many early customers returning to buy another. During the quarter, we also announced an increase in the range of the G500 and G600 by 200 and 300 nautical miles, respectively at long-range cruise of .8 Mach. At .9 Mach, we increased the G500 range by 600 nautical miles and the G600 by 300 miles. The increased ranges were proven during flight test and can be attributed to very successful control of the weight of these aircraft. And by the way we announced increases only when we are certain that can be delivered. We also enjoyed both record sales and earnings for the Gulfstream service business in 2017, which leads me to another subject. I rarely speak to you about the overall market. I usually speak to our own demand, which is held up very well in a slow market. We’ve clearly gained share from others in this market. Furthermore, my sense is that order activity and customer interest are picking up across the industry. I will look forward to the reports of other OEMs on this subject as they become available. Next, Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue was $1.75 billion, up $87 million or 5.2% and operating earnings were up $30 million or 13% on the quarter-over-quarter basis on the strength of 110 basis point improvement in operating margins. For the full-year, sales were up $419 million or 7.6%. Operating earnings were up $106 million or 12.8% on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, very strong operating leverage here. By the way this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat higher revenue and operating margins were 20 basis points better than guidance. We continue to see nice order activity in this group with Q4 orders of $1.7 billion. Tank orders in the quarter were $975 million, part of the $2.4 billion IDIQ type contract that we were awarded in the quarter. Internationally demand remained good. We signed a $1 billion, contract for combat wheel vehicles with Romania earlier this month and the pipeline remains robust, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. In our U.S market, our U.S. Army customer is modernizing, generating demand across our combat vehicle munitions businesses, fueling our .9 to 1 book-to-bill for the year. This is particularly impressive in a year of nice revenue growth. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth with content -- and continued its history of strong operating leverage. For Marine, revenue of $2.1 billion was up $163 million or 8.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $167 million were up $125 million against the year-ago quarter, which included a charge of Bath Iron Works which we discussed with you last quarter. Revenue for the full-year was down $68 million, less than 1% on lower commercial ship revenue at NASCO. Growth will resume in our planning horizon. Operating earnings for the year of $685 million were up $90 million on a 120 basis point improvement in operating margins. So better margins than 2016, but still not where we need to be. At this time last year we told you to expect revenue of $7.9 billion and operating earnings of $680 million to 685 million. So revenue was $104 million higher than forecast, but operating earnings of $685 million were consistent with the upper end of the target range. In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all three of our shipyards, we're investing in each of our yards. We will spend $1.7 billion in CapEx at Electric Boat over the next several years in anticipation of increased production on the Block V Virginia submarine and the new Columbia ballistic missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity. We also have increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island, to meet our need for skilled trade. Over the last two years alone, we have hired and trained 4,600 highly capable employees. We were also investing over $200 million in CapEx at Bath and NASSCO to meet the Navy's demand for more destroyers and auxiliary ships. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customers as they increase the size of the fleet. In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter of $2.49 billion was up $216 million or 9.5% against the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $282 million in the quarter were 22.1% better than the fourth quarter a year-ago on a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the year, revenue of $8.9 billion was down $253 million or 2.8%, but operating earnings of $1.01 billion were up $70 million or 7.4% on the strength of a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. Very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year we forecast a modest increase in revenue for the year with operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion and a margin rate of 11%. So the operating earnings came in as guided with lower revenue on a 40 basis point higher margin rate. As we’ve frequently pointed out, IS&T book-to-bill has been at or in excess of one-to-one for each of the past four years resulting in a healthy backlog. That said, the transition of that backlog and revenue has been slower than we originally anticipated. The combination of this ER and a new administration slowed the pace of awards particularly in our Fed civ business. While both defense and Fed civ picked up during the second half of the year, we simply did not have enough time before year-end to recover fully. This leads me to be confident that the growth in this business will materialize beginning in 2018. On this call a year-ago, on a companywide basis, our guidance for 2017 was to expect revenue of $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion and an operating margin of around 13.3%. We wound up the year with revenue of $31 billion, but were at the high-end of our operating earnings expectations because the operating margin of 13.5% was better than anticipated. Most of the revenue shortfall came in the short cycle IS&T segment that we just discussed. Last year this time we provided EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55. Without the regard to the $119 million charge related to tax reform, we wound up at $9.95, $0.40 to $0.45 better. So let me provide some guidance for 2018 and some out year commentary on 2019 through 2021 initially by business group and then a companywide rollout. In aerospace, we expect 2018 revenue to be $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 million. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of 18%. The margin rate is lower in 2017 as a result of mix shift and increased R&D spending as well as a modest increase in pre-owned sales which again carry no margin. In aerospace, for the five year period 2017 through 2021, we expect a sales CAGR of slightly more than 7%. That CAGR rolls up a modest sales increase in 2018 with more significant growth in 2019 and beyond. While it is difficult to predict with fidelity our earnings rate as a result of significant mix shift, we see our earnings growth at a 3.5% to 5% CAGR. We see 2018 as the low point in earnings during the transition to our new models with modest earnings increases in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction in 2021.  In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be between $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, a $200 million to $250 million increase over 2017 with operating earnings of $970 million, a $33 million increase. This implies a margin rate of around 15.7% very similar to last year. For the period of 2017 to '21, the expected sales CAGR should be in excess of 7% and the earnings CAGR in the low 6% range. The Marine Group is expected to have revenues between $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion of $400 million to $500 million increase over 2017. Operating earnings in 2018 are anticipated to be between to be at 735 to 745, with an operating margin rate of about 8.7%. The 2017 to '21 sales CAGR is expected to be 5.6% with very strong growth in '19 and 2020 and gradually improving operating margins. The expected earning CAGR for the Marine Group from 2017 to 2021 is about 6.7%. Finally in IS&T, we expect revenue in 2018 of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, an increase of $400 million to $500 million. We expect operating earnings to be up $20 million to $30 million over the last year with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a sales CAGR of 5.5% and an earnings CAGR of 5%. So for 2018 companywide all of this rolls up to $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion of revenue, up 4.4% to 4.8% over 2017. Operating earnings of 4.25% and an operating margin around 13.1%. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $10.90 to $11 per fully diluted share. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 19% tax provision and assumes we only buy shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures, so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, divide our guidance into four and take $0.35 off Q1, $0.05 off Q2 and Q3 and add $0.45 to Q4. For the period of 2017 to 2021, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 6.3% and an operating earnings CAGR of 5%. This was simply a rollup of the projections I've given you for each of the business groups. We are quite bullish about the 2018 through 2021 period in all segments. Let me turn this call over to Jason for additional commentary and then we'll take your questions.
A - Jason W. Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I will start with the subject that’s getting a lot of attention and impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that’s the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 36.9 for the quarter and 28.6% for the full-year. Removing the effects of tax reform, our effective tax rate was 25.1% for the quarter and 25.7% for the full-year. The unfavorable impact on our tax provision that Phebe discussed is due primarily to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset at the new lower statutory rate as required under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Looking ahead to 2018, we expect a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 19%. This rate reflects the lower statutory rate on domestic income, the elimination of historic tax benefits such as the domestic production credit and the fact that the tax rate applicable to our international operations are now essentially at parity with our U.S operations, if not slightly higher. This contrasts with our history with a relatively lower taxes on our international operations had a beneficial impact on our consolidated effective tax rate relative to the previous 35% U.S statutory rate. As a reminder, we generally forecast minimal tax benefit from equity-based compensation in our tax rate. This benefit was the primary driver of the steady improvement in our tax rate throughout 2016 and 2017, but we've not reflected a similar level of benefit in 2018 as any impact will be driven by future option exercises. So we will update our tax rate as they occur. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense for the year to $103 million versus $91 million for 2016. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter of 2016. As you will recall, we issued $1 billion of debt in the third quarter of this past year to replace $900 million of notes maturing in the fourth quarter at a slightly higher interest rate. As a result, we expect 2018 interest expense to increase to approximately $150 million. We ended the year with $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt position, debt less cash and equivalents of $1 billion. That’s down from approximately $1.6 billion at the end of 2016. As Phebe mentioned, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter and we received significant deposits on new aircraft orders and scheduled progress payments on our large international combat vehicle programs. Cash from operations was $2 billion in the quarter and $3.9 billion for the full-year. For 2018, we anticipate cash from operations of approximately $3.7 billion. On the capital deployment front, in the fourth quarter, we purchased 1.9 million shares bringing us to 7.8 million shares for $1.5 billion for all of 2017. In total, when combined with the dividends paid, we've returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2017, and we've also made several acquisitions in our aerospace and IS&T groups this year totaling $400 million. Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed about $200 million to our plans in 2017 as forecast. For 2018, our minimum contribution is approximately $300 million to be paid mostly during the second quarter. We will examine potentially increasing our contribution somewhat as the year progresses in light of the opportunity provided by the recent tax reform. Howard, that concludes my remarks. I will turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Howard A. Rubel: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Denise, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Certainly, sir. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Phebe, a quick question on capital deployment. I was wondering if your plans for future cash deployment have changed as a result of the U.S tax reform, you obviously ended the year with a very strong balance sheet and cash flow?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, let me just reiterate what our tax -- what our cash deployment -- capital deployment strategy has been. First, we invest in our business where we believe that we can get a good return. We are in a period right now of growth that needs to be supported by investments and happily and officiously we’ve a tax bill that gives us more free cash flow. So it's a nice marrying of objective and reality. We also look for transactions, acquisitions that are accretive in our core and you saw some of that this past year in 2017. The only -- and we’ve talked about this for many years, the only long-term steady reliable repeatable elements of cash and capital deployment are dividends. Share repurchases, we cover dilution and then all of our other share repurchases have been tactical. So I don't see a particular change in the strategy. The tactics, of course, are driven by the needs of the business and in the case of tax reform provide us additional free cash flow. So a happy event.
Robert Stallard: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: I wanted to go back to your aero margin guidance for '18 and the small contraction there on the mix shift and the higher R&D and the slightly higher pre-owned I guess. Phebe, with the timing on the 500 and 600 wrapping up, would have thought R&D might have track down a little bit, maybe there's something else you’re developing there and how is pricing on the aircraft that will deliver in '18 versus '17?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, first of all, we never discussed price. But suffice it to say, that is not driving any margin changes or compression. So I think it might be appropriate just to remind ourselves where we've been for the last couple of years and where the next two years, this year and '19 are. So we've been in a transition period and think about the transition in two pieces. One, that we've been living through to the last two years where we're bringing down 455 50 production and offset any earnings decline as a result of that we committed to attempt to keep earnings flat by increasing somewhat the 650 production, which we’ve done in addition to cutting costs and improved operating efficiency and good planning, all of that has happened. Now as we move into the full throttled transition where the 450 is out of production this year, the 550 is coming down to low rate and ultimately very low rate production, we are feathering back from 650s as appropriate and as we told you we would and the advent of the 600 comes on board, 500 and then 600. So we're pretty much on track -- we are very much on track and exactly the progression, the magnitude and the duration of this transition period that we’ve been in. We never discussed our R&D, but again suffice it to say that it has been robust and it will continue to be robust going forward.
Robert Spingarn: So, Phebe, if I might, is it -- are you saying it's just a bit of learning curve on the new platforms?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Sure. So let's talk about new platforms. Always have a -- they start at a lower margin rate and improve over time if they come down our learning curve. In addition, the first lot of any new airplane -- that’s airplanes tend to carry with them lower margins. So as we get the first lot of the 500 and 600 out at the production line and we improve our learning, which we have done historically and I’m confident we will do again, then we will eventually see margin expansion and that's the kind of earnings growth I’m talking about in the latter end of our planning period.
Robert Spingarn: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will be from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Samuel Pearlstein: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning.
Samuel Pearlstein: Can you talk a little bit about how we should think about the net income conversion to free cash flow in 2018, just given the tax change, the additional pension contribution and then just the capital spending plan? And just overall, does CapEx continue to grow from this level into even next year? Just how do we think about that?
Jason W. Aiken: Sure. So, we gave you some figures on operating cash flow in the remarks around call it $3.7 billion. And I think to your point with the tax reform and as Phebe alluded to that increases net income and by like amount increases free cash flow. So I don't think tax reform necessarily has -- have there no tax reform, didn’t have any impact on our free cash conversion rate. What it does provide us is additional free cash flow that we can then deploy. And as Phebe mentioned, we have opportunities including in our shipyards as well as additional R&D and product development opportunities across the business to invest in the growth of the company, and that is something we intend to continue to do. So between those opportunities that will notch up or down over the course of the year and beyond as well as, as I alluded to the opportunity to perhaps take advantage of the tax reform to fund a little bit more into our pension plan. The free cash flow conversion could end up approaching a 100%, if not a 100%, we continue to target that range, but call it still in the 90s, we well exceeded a 100% in 2017 even beyond our original expectations, but we are back structurally in that range. And so I think that’s how need to think of it. But we will probably focus more on operating cash flow as a number that’s more directly targetable because some of those other levers will move up and down, CapEx, R&D, and so on to support the growth of the business and they could move the cash conversion rate from the mid 90s to the 100% range depending on where those ultimately end up, all opportunities for growth in the business.
Samuel Pearlstein: But you -- I mean, you mentioned the $1.7 billion being spent at EB. And just -- what is the absolute level of CapEx we should expect in 2018?
Jason W. Aiken: So, we typically target around 2% of sales. We’ve come in a little lower than that in the past, so I'd expect to see us toward the higher end of that this year and in terms I think you asked a question about how does that plan over time. Some of that is -- its still in play. It's a longer term plan, but I think you will see it come up a little bit over the next few years and then back down as we go through that facility master plan.
Samuel Pearlstein: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harned: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning.
Douglas Harned: When you -- Phebe, when you talked about the guidance for this year and also the five-year guidance, how do you -- how are you thinking about the budget situation? In other words, the continuing resolution, we are in the fourth one now. It's not completely clear where this is going to go. Where do you see -- you mentioned IS&T before, but where do you see the biggest issues in your portfolio if we have a further extension of CRs and how have you dealt with this in your guidance short and long-term?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So the budget have been very supportive of our program of records and our new programs. And I haven't seen any surprises there. Typically, we can cover a relatively short-term CR rather wholesomely and this year was a little bit different, and I can get into that if you wish. But what we've done is appropriately hedged our guidance with some expectations around varying length of the CR. So we will be and I believe better shape, and we’re comfortable that we're in better shape this year with an extended CR than we were last year. Just to give you a little bit of color what happened last year, in particular with IS&T, which -- let's talk about the short cycle businesses tend to be more affected by a CR, but typically we can cover that. In '17, we had a couple of other things happen. And let me restate that or reinforce that the vast preponderance of the '17 revenues that we didn’t get in '17 and moved into '18, but in addition to the CR, we had a number of new Army startups which had a disproportionate effect on the impact in both GDIT and Mission Systems. You may also recall that the Army stopped funding WIN-T and some other related comms programs until they completed their network and battlefield review. So that drove a couple of months of revenue from 2017 to 2018. And then we had a new administration with some unanticipated civil agency cuts that we had not forecasted and -- but that's been addressed by our customers in Fed civ as they modified their plans. So I think our ability to manage a CR is significantly better this year because I don't see any of those other factors contributing to perturbation in the IS&T sales.
Douglas Harned: And presumably also in your outlook you’ve got like Combat for example, you’ve got a lot of international in there as well. I'm assuming that’s a big -- that’s an important part of that growth rate?
Phebe N. Novakovic: It is, but if the -- don’t underestimate the increase and modernization funding coming from the Army, that becomes an increasingly large component of our backlog throughout our planning period.
Douglas Harned: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.
Peter Skibitski: Yes. Phebe -- first of all, good morning, Phebe and Jason and Howard. Phebe, we’ve had the new National Defense Strategy released last week and there's a lot of strategy shift, I think, more so to pure [ph] conflict and various areas of modernization needed. How do you think GD's capabilities matchup with that new strategy given -- at some point, I think, money will follow the strategy?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think very well. I have long said that I like the positioning of our platform, defense platform businesses because they tend to be somewhat countercyclical. In a hot war, the tactical forces received the preponderance of the funding and that was true certainly in the hot wars of Iraq and Afghanistan. When we wind down from active intense conflict than the strategic forces, which in our case is the Navy, tend to receive more funding. In this instance, what we have is a little bit of a combination of both that we need to grow the fleet for the obvious threats that we’ve in the North Atlantic and Pacific, and the Army needs to recapitalize based on -- it's had a number of years over a decade of the consumption of its material, but it needs to not only replace but upgrade that material and they put the money behind it. So I like, I think, we’re well-balanced. I don’t want any particular surprises in any of the studies that have come out recently and we had factored all of that into our thinking.
Peter Skibitski: Just to go further on ground vehicles, Congress added an awful lot of money in its mark ups for fiscal '18. Is there maybe even some room for upside to your Combat forecast if that money comes through?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, let's put it this way. We are mindful that there can be an appetite for increasing particular program and ours have been very heavily supported, but -- particularly in the authorization process, but the appropriations have to follow. We're very comfortable that the programs that we have, our core programs of record in appropriation still are fully funded and frankly this is true across our portfolio. The more money that’s available, the higher our revenue and opportunities can be. So I am comfortable with where we are in the moment on our projections given what we believe to be the likely outcome of at least the near-term budget cycle.
Peter Skibitski: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein: Good morning. Phebe, you gave us some pretty good detail already on the sales backdrop for Gulfstream. Can you give us some more color on kind of who is buying these jets? Is it Fortune 500, is it across the board? Is it the U.S? Is it Europe? Is it Asia? And then a follow on to that would be what’s your sense now on the J-Stars program? Because that could have an impact for a 550 production.
Phebe N. Novakovic: So, order activity and frankly our backlog are heavily United States, Canada, and Europe, Far East, lesser extent Mid East. And in my case, some of that are backlog of what you need to think about it, we understand every single buyer in our backlog. We know them, they’re sound financially. It's a sticky backlog and we have very few fleet customers. So as between -- so it is a very steady sturdy backlog, and the mix between public companies, private companies and individuals vary nearly about [indiscernible], and in any given quarter that can go up a little bit among those three categories, but no material difference in the last few years and what we are seeing in terms of a consist and geographical location of our customer base. J-Stars, I refer to you Northrop, because they’re our prime. But the 550 will be in load a very low rate production for the foreseeable future and we will support the plan that Northrop has for us.
Ronald Epstein: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will be from Jon Raviv of Citi. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Raviv: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just to slightly follow-up on that capital allocation question. Just can you talk, Phebe and Jason a little bit more about the M&A outlook? You brought up some of the acquisition activity you had in 2017, any kind of shift in the market that you’re detecting heading into 2018 and where you might be interested and to what extent from a bite-size perspective?
Phebe N. Novakovic: We never comment on the environment for acquisitions. So I think I'll pass on that. You have another question?
Jonathan Raviv: Sure. I appreciate that. When it comes to the CapEx plans that -- at your shipyards, how do you think about the returns on that CapEx? I mean, is that associated with client that you know are in place that the Navy is going to be able to afford or is there a little bit of assumption or intention that improving the shipyards will help the Navy for their larger shipbuilding plan?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Look, we have always been very disciplined about our capital deployment and you can expect in this instance that we have planned our investments as close in time to the returns as possible. The Navy understands that. There are contractual provisions in all of our contracts that provide for harmonizing across to better optimize the investment with the returns. We are not speculative of the nation needs to fund the submarine force in particular. And our investments are twofold. One, they clearly make us more efficient, but it also helps the affordability for the Navy. So it's a win-win for both us and the Navy and we’re in very close contact and have been completely aligned with the Navy with respect to the quantum and the timing of our investments and we fully understand the need for a reasonable return.
Jonathan Raviv: Got it. Thanks for the second swing at the ball there.
Operator: The next question will be from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning, Phebe, Jason, Howard.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning.
Jason W. Aiken: Good morning.
Carter Copeland: Phebe, just a quick clarification on a comment you made earlier and then -- just a question on demand. But the initial production lot on new programs comment that you made before, if you can just clarify what is the size of a typical initial early production lot for new airplane? And then just with respect to the demand outlook and I know you kind of hinted at this with the industry-wide comment on expanding orders or -- I don’t want to get the words wrong here, across the industry, but when you look at the plan that you laid out through 2021, I’m just trying to get a sense of what the underpinnings are there and if there's any expectation that the tax reform has a material impact on buying decision, I realize we're only a couple of weeks into the year, but any chance you can help us understand how to quantify what those sorts of impacts might be or what you expect or where you may have been conservative, anything there would be helpful. Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic: So -- well, let me just say one thing here about tax reform. It can't hurt, right. So …
Carter Copeland: Absolutely.
Phebe N. Novakovic: So we will see how that plays out, but it frankly didn't factor into our projections. The demand -- we based our plan on the demand that we see about the -- what I’ve called now for many, many quarters, a robust pipeline. The pipeline remains robust and we are a believer because history actually supports this view and experience support this view that new product generates additional incremental demand. We've got new product coming out. So I’m comfortable that our demand projections that’s been a manifest in our deliveries are reasonable. And let me -- so I think -- I hope that gives you a little bit of color, but let me have Jason address the lot.
Jason W. Aiken: Sure. And yes -- and without getting into the specifics of our inventory numbering system, suffice it to say, a lot of aircraft at Gulfstream we would burn through within a year in terms of delivery. So when you think about the 500 or any airplane that’s entering into service, there's going to be a natural production ramp. And so we won't quite get through the first full lot in this year, but there will be a handful of unit that will deliver in the early part of next year. So we'll be through that first production lot by early next year.
Carter Copeland: So we’re talking not a handful, but a dozen or dozen something like that?
Jason W. Aiken: Exactly. Its more than a handful.
Carter Copeland: Great. Thanks for the color.
Howard A. Rubel: And thank you Carter, and we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. And that will be from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Hunter Keay: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and I appreciate it. If you could to the extent possible, Phebe, talk about many incremental interest you maybe saw with the effective push out of Falcon 5X and maybe a broader question around that, so it's a two part question. How often do you see biz jet customers in, generally, switching brands? Does most competition come from competitors or is it really yourselves as always kind of competing against each other with new product offering? How often do you see switching broadly speaking?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, historically and this is historically customers have been pretty loyal to their particular brand. I think over the last three, four, five years, we’ve seen some -- we’ve seen changes in that prior behavior and we have gained share. We have -- we now have our customers in our backlog and are delivering airplanes to customers that were in other peoples, other airplane manufacturers, historical customer set. So I don't really think about it and I don't really know how much is from any particular -- how much of our incremental increases in our order book and in our backlog has been the result of others, but frankly we're the only ones really out there in the moment with a lot of new airplanes. We got the 650, we got the 500 and 600 coming right in behind it and then frankly the 280. So that I believe is the single largest reason for the increase in our backlog and more importantly in our orders and deliveries in the moment.
Hunter Keay: So would you say loyalty is more a function of -- sort of capabilities or do you sometime see that opportunity to take share, if there are, say, manufacturing or production delays with some of your competitors? Thanks so much.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I’m really not going to talk about our strategy. I don’t worry too much about what the others are doing. I think we just have to focus on doing what we do well and what we do well is we’re the low-cost, high quality producer across all of our fleet of airplanes and we have also funded and are executing a robust pipeline -- a robust R&D program that has allowed us to bring in consistently new product. I focus on that. I believe that is what ultimately drive success and that is what you’re seeing in the Gulfstream performance.
Howard A. Rubel: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Again, thanks for your time. You may disconnect.
Operator: Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, we will ask you to disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bill Moss, Vice President and Controller. Please go ahead, sir.
William A. Moss - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Denise, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Bill, and good morning. I'd like to start by sharing with everyone that Phebe is not able to be here today as she was unfortunately hit with a bad case of the flu. She's asked me to cover today's call, and I've invited our Controller, Bill Moss, to join me. We all wish Phebe a full and speedy recovery. But for now, let's get on with the results. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.52 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.58 billion; operating earnings of $1.052 billion; and income from continuing operations of $764 million, a 10.1% return on sales. The EPS performance was $0.16 better than the year ago quarter and $0.09 better than consensus. Against the year ago quarter, revenue was down $77 million, or 1%, but operating earnings were up $37 million, a 3.6% increase; and income from continuing operations was up $33 million, a 4.5% increase. The quarter's operating margin at 13.9% is 60 basis points better than the third quarter of 2016. Once again, we enjoyed very positive operating leverage. Sequentially, revenue was down $95 million, or 1.2%, while operating earnings were down $4 million and operating margin was up 10 basis points. From an operating perspective, the second and third quarters look a lot alike as we said they would. The $0.07 EPS improvement was driven by a modestly lower share count and a 180-basis point lower effective tax rate in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was off $211 million, less than 1%. However, operating earnings are up $177 million, or 6%, and operating margins are up 90 basis points. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations are also up $177 million, or 8.4%; and earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.71, 10.5% better year-to-date. With respect to cash, we had very efficient conversion in the quarter. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $871 million and free cash flow from operations of $751 million. For the year-to-date, we have cash flow from operations slightly in excess of $1.6 billion. As you can see from the charts attached to our press release, an important story in the quarter was the very healthy backlog increase. The total backlog of $63.9 billion is a $5.4 billion increase, in excess of 9% over the second quarter. There was very good contract activity in all of our groups, with particularly strong order intake in the Marine group. I should point out that each of our defense businesses enjoyed backlog growth, with the exception of NASSCO, and it didn't miss by much. Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $70 million, or 3.6%, compared to the third quarter of 2016; and operating earnings increased $8 million, or 2.1%, to $385 million on an operating margin of 19.3%. On a sequential basis, the group experienced $83 million less in revenue, about 4%, and a $40 million reduction in operating earnings attributable to a 120-basis point contraction in margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $157 million, or 2.6%; and operating earnings are up $120 million, or 10.6%, on a 150-basis point improvement in operating margin. We had good order intake in the quarter for the group of 0.8 to 1 book to bill measured on a dollar value of orders basis. But Gulfstream alone was a 0.9 to 1 book to bill on both a dollar value and a number of units basis. I can also tell you that our pipeline and active sale discussions are quite good. We're, again, reasonably optimistic about our order intake in the fourth quarter and I expect it to look much like the third quarter, if not somewhat better. Our certification flying continues to progress well, including the additional test points required to extend the G500 and G600 range. As we announced during the recent NBAA Air show, additional testing has enabled us to increase the G500 range by 200 nautical miles at 0.85 mach and 600 nautical miles at 0.90 mach. It's really quite remarkable that the G500, with a 5200-nautical mile range at 0.85 mach, can travel 4400 nautical miles at 0.90. This was the approximate range of the G450 at 0.80 mach. On the G600, our additional validation tests have proven an additional 300 nautical miles at 0.85 mach as well as 300 nautical miles at 0.90 mach. The additional testing required for the specific fuel consumption and center of gravity test points have ensured proper performance and safety margins in both aircraft. Although this lengthened the program schedule, we believe the resultant value to our customers was worth the effort. While flying has progressed on schedule, testing by one of our suppliers for component level qualification associated with the concurrent FAA and EASA certification has added a new complexity at the end of the program. While we accounted for this type of supplier impact in our plan, one of our suppliers apparently didn't anticipate the additional EASA test requirements and is somewhat behind. We expect to resolve this issue and deliver the G500 to our customers as planned. If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. So we're still on track and we continue to monitor the supplier closely as we near the end of the certification program. Turning to Combat Systems, the group had an excellent quarter with revenue of $1.5 billion, operating earnings of $247 million, and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. As you would expect, the quarter-over-quarter, sequential, and year-to-date comparisons are all quite favorable. Compared to third quarter of 2016, revenue was up $173 million, or 13%, and earnings were up $38 million, or 18.2%, on an 80-basis point improvement in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $86 million, or 6.1%, and operating earnings were up $22 million, or 9.8%, on a 60-basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, revenue was up over 2016 by $332 million, or 8.6%. Operating earnings are up $76 million, or 12.6%, on a 60-basis point improvement in operating margin. Combat Systems remains on course for a very good year. We fully anticipate that the fourth quarter will see around a 15% increase in revenue over this quarter, but also some degradation in operating margin as a result of a mix shift to new programs, so that the increase in operating earnings will be more modest than the revenue increase. All of our major programs are performing very well. We continue to see opportunities for growth both internationally and domestically for the group. The Marine group reported revenue of $1.93 billion, a $144 million or 6.9% decrease compared to the year ago quarter. Similarly, revenue was down sequentially by $148 million, or 7.1%, and year-to-date revenue of $5.94 billion was lower by $231 million, or 3.7%. Revenue across the year has been down based on Virginia-class Block III timing, a slowdown in the Columbia program design work as a result of extended negotiations over the IPPD contract, and the wind down of some of the commercial work at NASSCO. These revenue headwinds are now largely behind us. Operating earnings for the third quarter, that's $179 million, were down by $18 million compared to last year's quarter. On a sequential basis, the group's operating margins improved 70 basis points, which led to a $1 million increase in operating earnings despite the $148 million decrease in revenue. It's very nice to have margins in the group north of 9% once again. While this is encouraging, we'll have to see whether it's sustainable. And finally, IS&T. While IS&T's revenue at $2.15 billion was down $176 million or 7.6% against last year's quarter, it was up $50 million sequentially. Year-to-date revenue of $6.4 billion is down $469 million or 6.8% over last year. However, we expect a strong fourth quarter and we'll be especially flat with 2016 for the year. Revenue has been lower during the year primarily on timing. Lower than expected army product sales impacted the third quarter and the Army had trouble executing after the six-month CR and, of course, the change in administration slowed some execution as well. We'll recover a lot of this revenue in the fourth quarter but don't have enough time to recover at all. Some anticipated revenue will slip into next year, but we're in a good position to hold 2017 revenue close to the 2016 level. In sharp contrast, operating earnings of $253 million were up $14 million, or 5.9%, compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 140- basis point improvement in operating margins. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings were up $13 million (sic) [$14 million] (10:43) or 11.7% operating margins, which is a 30-basis point improvement. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings are up $19 million, a 2.7% increase, on a 110-basis point improvement in the operating margins. So IS&T has managed to overcome less than anticipated revenue with very strong operating performance. So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year are concerned? We fully expect the fourth quarter to look much like the other three from an operating earnings perspective. However, we expect a higher effective tax rate in the quarter, leading to a lower reported EPS. For the year, stronger than expected operating results year-to-date, a lower than planned tax rate, and a modestly lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operations now goes to a range from $9.75 to $9.80. This late in the year, we anticipate our end of year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the range is narrow. And finally, in closing, as tempting as it is at this time of year to ask about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall, when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. The guidance that we gave you last January was grounded in that process and, as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from us in detail in January, as has been our custom for many years. I'd now like to turn the call back to Bill to cover some additional financial items.
William A. Moss - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Jason. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the third quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense year-to-date to $76 million versus $68 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter last year. For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $110 million, which includes the impact of the issuance of $1 billion of debt in the third quarter in anticipation of the repayment of $900 million in notes maturing in the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate was 25.6% for the quarter and 25.8% year-to-date. We're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of approximately 27%. The lower rate in the quarter and our reduced forecast for the year are both attributable to the finalization of open tax years and a greater benefit from employee stock option exercises than previously forecast. On the capital deployment front, in the third quarter we purchased 1.2 million shares, bringing us to 5.9 million shares in the first nine months of 2017 for $1.1 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first nine months, we've spent $1.9 billion or nearly 120% of our free cash flow year-to-date. We've also made a number of small acquisitions in our aerospace and IS&T groups this year totaling $364 million. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion and a net debt position of $2.2 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approach 100% of earnings from continuing operations, and will continue to deploy 100% of that free cash flow, less the amount spent on acquisitions, to dividends and share repurchases. With that, we will move to the Q&A. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Denise, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: I would be happy to, sir. And the first question will come from Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Jason and everyone else.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good Morning.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Wondering if you wouldn't – going into a little bit more detail on the supplier issue on the G500 and just kind of let us know whether this is a sole-source kind of position for this supplier or maybe a little bit more color on what kind of part this might be. And more specifically even on 2018, kind of when in the year you expect at this point for deliveries to make and whether you'll continue kind of plugging along on production at this point so that expectations around deliveries for the full year of 2018 are kind of no different than where we were, say, back in July during the last earnings call? Thanks.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So first off, I'm really not at liberty to get into any specifics around the specific supplier. That's somewhat confidential information that Gulfstream needs to deal with. But I can tell you that this is not an issue that has to do with anything related to flight tests or the flying capabilities or the readiness of the airplane to go into service. This is strictly a paperwork exercise that we're going through and, really, it has to do with, as we've noted, the additional test points that have allowed the additional range as well as I mentioned the simultaneous – this is the first time we've done a simultaneous FAA and EASA – that's the European Aviation Authority (sic) [European Aviation Safety Agency] (16:19) – certification. And really, that is a benefit to our customers, to achieve those simultaneous certifications so that we can accommodate the deliveries to our international customers. But long story short, this is not any type of risk item to the program. It's strictly a matter of getting through paperwork through that certification process. As it relates to 2018, as I mentioned, deliveries are still on schedule with our original plan and our original contractual customer dates. You may recall that for a while there we were optimistically considering that there might be an opportunity to advance that entry into service by three or four months. We had this opportunity to go after additional capability in the aircraft, and we did that knowing that we would still be able to meet our original customer commitments while achieving that additional capability. So really, no impact there. And likewise to your question, no impact on our expected 2018 delivery. The production and the delivery schedule remain intact as we originally anticipated, and so we don't see any modification there.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So Jason, I wanted to ask you about Marine. You talked a little bit about the nice uptick in the backlog there. And at the very end of the quarter, I think you took in a big Columbia order and then two destroyers, one Flight II and one Flight III. I'm curious how much risk you see and the impact on margins from this AMDR Flight III Destroyer, and in the margin profile on Columbia as we go forward here. It may not matter that much this year. I know you don't want to get into 2018, but I'm interested in the margin progression given that these destroyers are fixed-price incentive fee contracts and that we're bringing in this Columbia work.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. So as we've talked about, and I think you hit on it, the Columbia I think is the primary driver that we'll see, if for no other reason, just the volume impact it has as we continue to grow in the Marine Systems group throughout the balance of the decade. And as we've talked about, it is a development cost-plus type contract, so it will come at relatively lower margins that will continue to have a modest dilutive effect for the group. So that's no different I think than what we've talked about up to this point. It's good to have that contract in place so we can keep moving forward, but the margin impact is consistent with what we've talked about historically.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Jason, is there a way to quantify the mix of Columbia as a percentage of Marine as we go forward here?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: I don't have that in front of me. What I can tell you is that the growth profile that we laid out, which, really, we anticipated being off a little bit this year in volume and then picking up in 2018 and beyond until the end of the decade, the growth profile, if you follow that CAGR, is almost entirely attributable to Columbia. And it's essentially this design work. So you can put some orders of magnitude on it around there as it relates to the growth of the business and those relatively diluted margins.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then just Flight III versus II. It's something that we think about as being higher risk.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. So it's obviously a relatively significant change to the platform, with the additional radar capabilities. But we feel like we got to a place with the customer where we balanced the need to meet their requirements with the maturity of our design, and it's a balanced risk and opportunity situation. We feel very comfortable with the estimate we've put forth and we wouldn't have put a bid in if we didn't think we could do that. So we're still coming out of, as we've long talked about, some of the issues we had at Bath Iron Works with the four-year production break on the DDG-51 Destroyer line. So we feel very good about the progress they've made. We've got to keep watching that and making progress to see that it's sustainable, but we see this as fitting in very nicely to that book of business. I think we have seven destroyers in backlog at this point of the DDG-51 variety, and we think this is very wholesome for Bath Iron Works.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So you can hold margins as you transition on that program?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: I have every reason to believe that, yes.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much and good morning.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just to follow-up on the G500 question from earlier. I appreciate that you guys are on plan with regard to the original target entry into service date. A year ago on the call the company talked about the G500 making a significant contribution. I assume that meant to EBIT in 2018. Is that still the case?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Absolutely. Nothing has come off that. And so recall, there's been a lot of discussion around, is EIS going to be at the end of 2017, beginning of 2018 – we were talking about EIS as a demonstrator model because of the demand requirements that our sales organization was having. And so there's been a lot of back-and-forth over when is the first unit going to be there and what's that going to look like. But fundamentally, two things. With the new revenue recognition protocol, that was never going to be a big impact on 2017, hence the more significant impact in 2018 that we described. And as I said at the outset in the earlier question, the production and delivery schedule we're still adhering to and are on track for. So continue to see 500 ramp-up in 2018 as having a meaningful impact as we draw down. We'll deliver the last 450 in January of next year. We'll continue to draw down the 550 and we'll start to feather out a couple of 650s. So the 500 is a major contributor among those factors.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. And then Jason, maybe if you could just describe the acquisitions that you made, kind of what they are and how much they're contributing.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So we've had a number over the year. They've been mostly small in nature. The more recent one was a business in our IS&T group, really out of our IT services business. And it specializes in mission support for the intelligence community, so it fits right in our core as it relates to the GDIT services and a growth market for us. It closed right near the end of the third quarter, in mid to late September, so not really much of an impact. In fact, no really impact at all in the third quarter but we'll expect to see that to start to contribute in the fourth quarter and beyond. The other acquisitions were a couple of small aerospace services business and another mission computing business that we acquired earlier in the year at smaller amounts.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure.
Operator: The next question will come from Rob Epstein (sic) [Ron Epstein] of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning, Jason.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Hey. Good morning.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just maybe a bigger question for you. When you look at the balance sheet of the corporation, right, you guys are really not very levered at all. And when you think about the efficiency of the balance sheet, is there more you could be doing with it?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: We've spoken for some time about the fact that, A, we don't have a target balance sheet leverage position; we really are more focused on a couple of things. Number one is maintaining the balance sheet firepower that we have for strategic opportunities that will enable long-term growth. So with the free cash flow we have and the balance sheet capacity that we've had, we've been able to do things like invest in capital facilities, invest in product development across the portfolio, Gulfstream, now Electric Boat in the facility. As well as of course deploy meaningful amounts of capital; in this case, primarily to shareholders in the form of dividends and the share repurchase. I think as we look forward, a couple of things. We like our credit rating, where we stand today, and we don't look to modify that. But certainly, we see the balance sheet as an opportunity for when and if strategic opportunities come up, that we are ready to be agile and move quickly with those opportunities. You saw that in a small dose here in the first nine months. That's a little bit more of a toe in the water compared to where we've been for the past few years. Where that leads us, we'll see. It really is all about continuing to find accretive opportunities that are in our core, and that's really never changed. That's always been the case and that really is what we hold that balance sheet firepower for.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And is it safe to assume if there aren't accretive opportunities that come along that you guys are interested in, you would pick up the return to shareholders either through the dividend or the buyback?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So we'll continue to evaluate that on an annual basis. Right now, that continues to be our cadence through the balance of the year. I'm sure you've heard Phebe talk about priorities on capital deployment, that the dividend should be predictable and repeatable and sustainable, so we'll look to continue that. And share repurchase, of course, as always, we do not view that as a strategy. It's been a tactical approach to how we deploy capital, and we'll continue to frankly take it that way. So I think no real change that I foresee in that regard.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC: Yes, thank you very much. So if you're late, there've been some rumors that the G500 might not deliver until midyear. Do you expect to deliver in the first quarter still? And if there is an additional delay, what kind of impact do you expect that to have on cash? And lastly, your competitor, the 5X at Falcon, clearly has had another extended delay. Do you expect or have you seen any pickup in orders as a result of that? Thanks.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So I don't know of anything about the 500 delay until midyear. Like I said, we remain on track for deliveries in the early part of 2018. So rumors are rumors. I don't necessarily want to speak to that kind of speculation but we remain on track with our contractual delivery timing. And so as it relates to further delays, it would also be, I think, somewhat speculative. I don't know what that would look like, and frankly don't anticipate them, so I don't see an impact to cash or otherwise associated. We are on track and feel good about our ability to close on the certification and get the airplane into service in accordance with our original contractual commitments. As it relates to competition, we tend not to speculate about them or gauge our performance based on what others are doing. It's fair to say over the past couple of years that we have been the beneficiary of taking some share in this market. It's not something we focus on; it's just a fact. But obviously, if they continue to have issues, if others continue to have issues, we'll continue to do our best to perform and be as competitive as we can be in this market.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC: Thanks so much.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Absolutely.
Operator: The next question will be from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just part one on cash flow, if I could. I think you mentioned that cash flow return in the form dividends and share repurchase would be 100%, but now it would be 100% after your spend on acquisitions, which I think is a nuance to your price. I'm asking you to just confirm that. And secondly, on the cash flow in the quarter and the full year, did you do the pension contribution in 3Q and what in particular is going to allow you to get to 100% for the full year in 4Q? Thanks.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So on the first question, you read that correctly. It may be a subtlety that we're articulating because it's relevant in the moment, but it's always been our approach that, with respect to capital deployment, I mentioned a minute ago the dividend approach, that steady and repeatable M&A is there if and when we find accretive and core acquisitions, and then the residual from a tactical standpoint is share repurchase. So I don't think that's any different than what we've talked about; it's just that they've become relevant as you've seen it here in the third quarter of this year. So that is absolutely the case. As it relates to pension, we did make our scheduled pension contribution so no change to the outlook. With respect to that, for the year I believe the number was somewhere in the ballpark of $200 million. I don't think that's changed. And as it relates to closing out the year, we've got a big fourth quarter lined up but frankly that's not unusual for us. It's a pretty typical pattern for us. And one of the things we, I think, would look to as the biggest driver behind the ramp there in the fourth quarter is the transition to billing and delivery and collection on these major international programs is starting to unwind a good bit of that working capital in the fourth quarter. That's the single biggest driver that brings us down that curve.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just to clarify. So if M&A continues to be a few $100 million at a time though, that's actually subtractive from the 100% return and the balance sheet kind of just gets preserved in terms of the leverage you currently have and there's no net increase in leverage from M&A?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: I don't want to speak to long-term leverage. We'll get into that depending on the deals that may be out there. I think as it relates to the impact on share repurchase, as I've said, that's always tactical. And while we targeted a 100% return between dividends and share repurchase modified by the acquisition activity, that's a rough number because it's tactical; it's something we shoot for. If it were a penpoint, sort of bullet point at the target, then it wouldn't be tactical; we'd be driving toward a fixed answer. And if you look back over the past couple years, we've in fact well exceeded the 100% return benchmark, and this year we're on target to meet that. So I don't know that it has any direct implication. We'll just have to assess each of those opportunities when they come up and see what they do with respect to the implications on the long-term leverage.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure.
Operator: The next question will come from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Just want to talk about the fourth quarter in terms of some of the comments you made. So you said Combat could be up 15% sequentially. That means it's up, call it, 5.5% to 6%. And for the year, that seems like it's a little bit lower than the 7% plan. I just want to make sure I'm doing that correctly. And then second, in IS&T, with this big ramp-up in the fourth quarter, I'm wondering how much of that 20-something percent year-over-year growth that you need to get is coming from this acquisition versus the remainder of the business?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So I'd have to check, and we can go back offline and discuss the math, but the 15-ish percent increase sequentially is entirely consistent with our original forecast of the Combat Systems group being up 7%, maybe a touch higher, approximately 7% full year over 2016. So we're very comfortable with that and that's in the backlog. As a relates to IS&T, as I've said, it is a steep curve in the quarter but we feel very good about it. The pieces are in place to achieve that growth. There are a lot of moving parts but it's in the backlog. We had a good September which leads us to feel like we're very well-positioned to close out the year in a strong fashion. Most of that growth is coming out of the products business, and the order cadence is there to support that. So again, while there's a lot of moving parts, we feel very good about where we are and the pieces are in place to get there. In terms of the impact of the acquisition, I would say that's not the big driver. It has an impact, but to be honest with you I don't actually have that number in front of me. The big driver is the catch up from the timing we've seen throughout the year and its impact that it's had on our Mission Systems product business. We've talked a good bit about those timing effects of the Army procurement and some of the civil agencies and so on that we've seen delayed by the six-month-plus CR and so on. But we feel good about that timing starting to catch back up this year. If we don't get fully back to the 2016 level, it'll be close and that timing will just spill over a little bit into 2018.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure.
Operator: The next question will come from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, Doug.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I wanted to stay on IS&T because you're talking about some real progress there, but at the same time we've seen the Army decision to halt WINT-T and you all didn't make it through the down select on JTRS. How are you looking at Army communications now longer-term? Is this an area where – I mean, how should we expect those program situations to affect IS&T longer-term? And is this an area that you perhaps need to shore up or invest in?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. So look, I think bottom line, when you think about this tactical network backbone for the Army, that is absolutely as square in our core as anything else that's out there, and so we feel very good about the fact that we will continue to be a player from a systems integration role moving forward. Obviously, the Army is yet to define what its revised tactical networking baseline is going to be, so we don't want to get out ahead of that. But as we see it right now, the decisions that have been made to-date and what's on the table at this point has a minimal revenue impact, if any, to 2018. So we feel very comfortable with where we're headed for 2018. And frankly, beyond that, the impact will depend on future Army decisions, so it probably wouldn't be appropriate to speculate and get out ahead of them at this point. What I can tell you, as you are well aware, IS&T is a makeup of a vast portfolio of lots of different opportunities and programs. And so even this one, if it has some impact, is not going to be one that changes our overall long-term outlook for the group. So we feel comfortable that our multi-year CAGR for the group, which I think we gave you at 4.5% or so, remains intact at this point.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So that's good; even if you should not get back in on whatever replaces WIN-T, you still feel pretty good about that growth level.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: We do feel good. Yes.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will be from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Hey. Good morning, Jason.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Hey. Good morning, Carter. How are you?
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Good. I wonder if you could expand, since it's not in the release, but with respect to the margin strength, was there anything to note from a gross favorable, EAC adjustments or anything like that? Maybe you could give us some color on how those looked favorable versus unfavorable by segment just to kind of give us some color on what was in there in the margins.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. I don't have it by segment in front of me. I know the number in aggregate for the quarter was right around $100 million, which was off a little bit from the second quarter but higher than the first quarter, and that's, of course, right in line with the increased variability we anticipated seeing with these changes under the new revenue recognition model. It did have a good favorable effect on IS&T. I think we had 11.7% margins in the quarter for IS&T. That's not likely to be sustained in the fourth quarter, albeit the margins will continue to be strong for the group in the fourth quarter, but we'll see that come back down a little bit. A little bit of an impact in Combat Systems but not too, too much with respect to changes in estimates or true ups. And in Marine Systems, we did see a couple of modest, albeit a handful of booking rate changes on some of those programs which, in this case, all just happen to line up positively, and so you saw the strong margin in Marine Systems in the quarter. So I would frankly expect to see the Marine Systems margin tick back down a little bit in the fourth quarter but still to show good progress in those yards. So bottom line, it had an effect. It was favorable to the quarter but not in an outsized way compared to where we've been in the past. And again, barring a similar trend in the fourth quarter, we expect to see some of those margins notch back down just a little bit to a range that we consider to be more normal.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Great. Thanks for the color.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure.
Operator: The next question will come from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thanks very much. Good morning.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, Rob.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Jason, I thought I would just follow-up on the M&A that you did this year. I know it's relatively small, but does this signal that you're perhaps a little bit more open to do deals going forward? Or does this show that some of the prices have come in relative to what you think is fair, or that some specific assets came up for sale?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. I really don't think this signals any difference in our perspective or our approach to the market. While we've been fairly quiet on this front for the past few years, it doesn't mean that there hasn't been sort of activity under the surface in terms of looking and evaluating things that are out there. As I've said before, we will continue and will always look at deals that are accretive and are in our core, whether they're large or small. And in this case, a couple of them happen to come in. To speculate about what the future would look like would probably be getting a little bit out ahead of ourselves because I really just don't see what that is. But this will always be our approach until I'm told that it's not. And it's just, again, a focus on accretive core deals and we'll announce them as they come.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And just a follow-up. When you say accretive, are you talking earnings accretive, free cash accretive, and over what period? Is it by year two or something like that?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So specifically, earnings accretive in the first full year. Obviously, if you bring it in late in the year it's going to have a hard time overcoming that geometry. But, yeah, accretive in the first full year and that's earnings accretive and, of course, the cash to follow.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. That's great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey. Good morning.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey, Jason. Can you update us on your expectation for Gulfstream mid and large cabin deliveries for this year?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. No change from what we've talked about earlier. We're still looking to be right at about 120 deliveries for the year. I think if I recall, I don't have it right in front of me, but that's 89 or 90 large cabin and 30 or 31 mid cabin, so that remains unchanged. Obviously, as you get toward the end of the year, you could see a unit flip back or forth, so we'll manage that. But right in line at this point as we look at the balance of the year.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Okay. Just as a follow-up. I was wondering if you're seeing any improvement at all in emerging market demand at Gulfstream.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: The markets continue to be solid for us. We've sort of hit a familiar drumbeat, right, throughout the past several quarters and even the past couple years. Emerging markets are showing signs of activity. Our core continues to be North America, and that's where over half of our order activity and backlog is centered. But we're seeing, I'd say, probably another quarter of the activity associated with Asia, Asia Pacific. And then if you take other regions notching down, I'd say Europe, then Latin America, then Mideast Africa, sort of in that order in decreasing amounts. But we are seeing decent order uptick activity and customer interest around the globe.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, Jason. Thanks for taking my question.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. Good morning.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: Just within Combat Systems, good revenue growth and good EBIT growth. Can you just attribute that to specific international programs, what the ramp should look like? And you mentioned the margin impact. Maybe if you could walk us through what the impact is, any productivity savings off that. Thank you.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So the growth in the group so far this year has really largely been attributable to the ramp in the international programs that we've discussed. We've started the delivery process for those programs. And in fact, we're now up at full rate production for the large Middle East program coming out of Canada. We've started to make initial deliveries on – I think we've made the first handful of deliveries on the UK AJAX program. That will start to build rate and come up to full rate throughout and toward the end of next year, so you'll see some ramp next year attributable to that, and that'll sustain out through the next couple of years and beyond. The Middle East international program, as I've said, is at full rate and will be pretty steady state for the next couple of years. And now we're starting to see the startup of US domestic ground forces recap, and we'll see that more of an influence in the fourth quarter. So I would expect more of the growth that we see in the fourth quarter to be about those programs. And really, that dovetails into your margin question because we'll start to see those coming in at traditional sort of US Defense entry-level program margins, and so that'll have somewhat of a dilutive effect on the Combat Systems group margins in the fourth quarter as we start up those programs. So a really nice layering of the international programs, the Middle East having a big effect this year, Army recap starting this year and moving into next year, and then the UK program ramping next year and beyond. So I think it's a wholesome position for Combat to be in and supported by the tremendous backlog that they see in that group.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thank you.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Denise, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And that will be for Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: On the Virginia-class subs, would you have capacity to increase production there to three if there were ever budget support for a higher rate? And then what kind of investment would that require on your part?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Well I think your comments taken in reverse order. Number one is if the money is there to support it, absolutely. I would tell you that we have the capacity to move the rate up, so we're at a steady two per year now in the foreseeable future. There is conversation around what to do in years when a Columbia submarine is delivered, and so we'll have to see if there's opportunity from a budget standpoint to add Virginia-class there. But bottom line, we stand ready to do that. We have the capacity to do it and it frankly comes at a relatively minimal investment. The investments at this point moving forward that we're evaluating for Electric Boat really have to do with the Block V module – for the Virginia Payload Module on the next Virginia-class contract – and, of course, the Columbia investments, all of which we're in the process of discussing with the Navy.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure.
William A. Moss - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3311. Have a great day.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alison Harbrecht, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2017 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a solid second quarter, with revenue of $7.68 billion and net earnings of $749 million. We reported EPS of $2.45 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year ago quarter and $0.02 per share better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that the sell side anticipated somewhat more revenue, but lower margins and a somewhat higher tax rate. Operating earnings were about as forecast by the sell side. All in all, pretty close. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue of $7.68 billion was $99 million or 1.3% lower. However, net earnings of $749 million were up $35 million or 4.9%, on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margins and 160 basis point lower effective tax rate. This led to EPS that was 6.5% better than the year ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was up $234 million or 3.1% and operating earnings were up $21 million or 2%, on a 10 basis point lower operating margin, still very respectable 13.8%. Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Revenue was down $134 million, less than 1% against the first half of 2016. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $140 million or 7.2% on lower cost. Operating margins were 100 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $144 million or 10.5%. EPS was $0.55 better. In short, we had a very good first half, somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations, and well ahead of last year. This leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance in a minute. But first, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and wrap that into our EPS guidance. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $2.08 billion was $206 million lower than the year ago quarter. However, operating earnings of $425 million or $1 million more, on 190 basis point improvement in operating margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $4 million and operating earnings were down $18 million, on a 90 basis point reduction in margin, but remaining in excess of 20%. For the first half, revenue at $4.15 billion is up $87 million against last year. Importantly, operating earnings at $868 million are up $112 million or 14.8%, on a 230 basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $868 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, Aerospace is well positioned to achieve its earning goals for the year. By the way, recall we previously told you that the new revenue recognition rule which helped us in the first two quarters of the year would have a negative impact in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. So expect lower operating margins in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter. You'll see this reflected in our guidance. Let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter and then some observations about the current state of the market, insofar as it impacts Gulfstream. First, in the quarter, the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.9 to 1, which is very good. The mix is particularly advantageous, with over 80% of the orders for large-cabin aircraft. The G500 and G600 continued to build backlog in advance of their entry into service, sufficient to ensure the success of these programs, interestingly, the G550 built backlog as well in the quarter. While we read the reports of weak demand and reduced deliveries across the industry, our experience is reasonable and steady demand for our products. We will deliver as many airplanes this year as we did last on an entry-into-service basis. Commentators frequently speak of weakness in the large-cabin market. Let me say that it is misleading to speak of a highly differentiated marketplace as if it were one market. Parts of the market are very active, particularly those market segments where there is new product. There are also market segments that are slow, largely because of the absence of product introduction. So we believe that the market is not only differentiated by segment, but also by the innovative offerings within this segment. We believe this is why demand for our products remain fairly consistent. We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early contract activity and contract discussion. The interest in the G650 and G650ER as well as the G550 remains quite good and supportive of next year's operating plan. In short, we expect a good third quarter and a second half from an orders perspective. Now, let me say a few words about our progress towards certification of the G500 and G600. The G500 and G600 flying continues to go well. The aircraft are performing reliably and on schedule. The G500 testing includes four test aircraft and one production aircraft with a full interior. The four test aircraft have entered the Type Inspection Authorization or TIA flying phase. This phase is for actual certification credit. FAA pilots have joined Gulfstream flight crews on these TIA tests. We continue to work collaboratively with the FAA to ensure optimal safety and efficient use of resources. We expect to complete certification flying in Q4 2017. Additionally, we continue to work closely with our suppliers to complete all component level testing this year. Once we have completed certification, the interior test aircraft, P1, will enter service as our G500 demonstrator. It is important to note, however, that the G500 will not have any impact to revenue and earnings this year. That is the result of the new revenue recognition rule. The G600 now has four test aircraft flying and the interior is being installed in the first production aircraft. We remain on schedule to certify in 2018. Let's now turn to the defense side of the house. First, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.41 billion was $117 million more than the second quarter last year, up 9%. Similarly, operating earnings were $225 million, up $20 million, almost 10% better than second quarter 2016. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $127 million or almost 10%, and operating earnings were up $20 million, again, almost 10% better. For the first half, revenue was up $159 million or 6.3% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were up $38 million, 9.7% on a 50 basis point margin expansion. Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well across our platforms, ordnance and ammunition portfolios. We continue to move nicely from engineering to production on our two large international orders. We also continue to win programs particularly out of our European Land Systems business. We are obviously trending in the right direction at Combat Systems. With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $2.08 billion was $101 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $6 million against the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $145 million and operating earnings were up $17 million on the higher revenue and a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, revenue of $4.01 billion was down $87 million or 2.1% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were also lower by $17 million on a 30 basis points contraction in margin. Work on our submarine programs, that is production on Blocks 3 and 4 for the Virginia-class and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine replacement, continue to perform nicely. With respect to our Bath shipyard, the challenges on the DDG 1000 and 51 restart ships are largely behind us, and our auxiliary ship and commercial businesses continued smoothly. In addition, we have seen an uptick in demand for repair across our repair yards, primarily in San Diego and Washington State. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so. Our operating margin should continue to improve over time. Turning to IS&T, the group continues to perform well on the bottom line, despite some revenue headwind. Revenue of $2.1 billion was down $111 million against the year ago quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings of $240 million were up against the year ago quarter by $6 million. There was an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $42 million or 2%, but operating earnings were up $4 million on a 40 basis point improvement in margin. This quarter's 11.4% operating margin is exceptional in my view. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was down $293 million or 6.4%, but operating earnings were up $5 million on an 80 basis point improvement in margins. So once again, very strong operating leverage. For both our IT services and tactical communication and Intel business, our cost performance and market positioning have driven very nice win rates. Not surprisingly, our IS&T backlog grew $175 million in the quarter, with a book-to-bill of greater than 1 to 1 once again. In short, we believe the segment results leave us positioned to do well in the second half. Before I move on, let me give you a sense of the defense environment, at least from my perspective. There is clear intent in the administration and in parts of the Congress for increased defense spending. We believe this intent will manifest in some level of increased defense spending in the procurement and R&D accounts. The question is how much and when? Relevant considerations include: the dispatch with which Congress approves a higher defense budget and how soon the administration can propose and the Congress can approve the department's senior leadership appointment. Without these appointments, it is difficult to process contracts and get authorized and appropriated funds obligated to contracts. At this juncture, both are proceeding more slowly than we thought would happen. Nevertheless, we remain confident in the direction of defense spending. So turning to guidance, let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS outlook. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016; operating earnings of approximately $1.6 billion, with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. We now expect to be approximately $8.1 billion of revenue, with margins of 19.5% to 19.6%. This implies pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. This will result in no change to the operating earnings forecast, still a very strong industry-leading performance. For Combat, our previous guidance was to expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% over 2016, with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.9 billion, just slightly above the 7% growth over last year, and operating earnings of $925 million to $930 million. So pretty close to the original guidance, with a slight upward bias. For the Marine group, we've previously guided to revenue of $7.9 billion, margins at around 8.6% and operating earnings of $680 million to $685 million. We now expect revenue to be up another $160 million to $165 million, with margins consistent with the previous forecast, resulting in a modest improvement in operating earnings. For IS&T, we guided to revenue up modestly over 2016, operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast is essentially flat and that operating earnings will be somewhat better at about 11.2% to 11.4%. So all of this rolls up into revenue for General Dynamics of about $31 billion and operating margins of 13.3% to 13.5% – 13.4% to 13.5%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue, operating earnings at the higher end of the forecasted range, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70 to $9.75. To help you further, our EPS guidance was $9.50 to $9.55. The $0.20 difference is $0.05 from operations, $0.05 to $0.06 from a lower tax rate and about $0.09 to $0.10 from share purchases. The EPS progression for the remainder of the year is down slightly in Q3 versus Q2, with Q4 looking similar to this quarter. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $24 million versus $23 million in the second quarter of 2016. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $49 million versus $45 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $105 million. Our effective tax rate was 27.4% for the quarter and 26% year-to-date. As Phebe mentioned, we're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of 27.5%. That reflects a greater benefit associated with employee stock option exercises than originally anticipated. On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares, bringing us to 4.6 million shares in the first half of the year for $900 million. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid, through the first six months of 2017, we've spent $1.4 billion in shareholder-friendly capital deployment, more than 1.5 times our $857 million of free cash flow for the first half. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $2.1 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approximate 100% of net earnings and, in turn, deploying 100% of that free cash flow to share repurchases and dividends. Alison, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Amy, can you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Certainly. The first question comes from Ronald Epstein, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning, Phebe and Jason.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Ron.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Maybe just a big picture question for you, Phebe, in terms of the Land Systems business. We've seen a lot more press lately on the Russian T-14 Armata tank. When you look at the Land Systems business and you kind of look into the tea leaves, is there an opportunity there for you guys in terms of some sort of equipment response from the U.S. in terms of either yet another upgrade to the Abrams or something new, if you can add any color there.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes. So the U.S. Army is anticipating upgrading the Abrams to the next version, in part to meet the changing and evolving threat, frankly, worldwide. So we have factored a lot of that into our thinking. And if you think about it, we went from one tank production a month for several years, just keeping that plant on my support and we're now looking at nice, nice improvement and throughput for that plant. So we see demand increasing for the Abrams in various configurations, both domestically and outside the U.S. as well. So the Abrams is, I think, positioned quite well to do – to continue to grow.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Samuel Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, IS&T has been running down for the first half of the year, if I just look last year, it's little bit of a tough comparison, you're still expecting to get to flat. I mean, how do you get there? What do you need to win or what's happening with IS&T in terms of being able to get to growth in the second half of the year?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So let's talk about that in two respects. First, both of these businesses are shorter-cycle businesses and they're more affected by an extended CR. Recall, we had a seven-month extended CR, which had a impact on our products business and the execution of obligated funds, execution of appropriated funds in terms of obligation. So that's pretty much a question of timing as the military services gear back up on their execution. The second side is on our services business. We had very slow execution on programs in several civilian agencies, primarily driven by uncertainty and, in some cases, reduction in funding levels. I suspect some of that we'll obtain through the course of the year until the administration sorts out some of the funding for some of the civilian agencies. But that said, we believe that our products business is poised for growth for the remainder of the year. Recall, we have a very nice backlog in this business, so it's simply a question of timing, when our customers execute programs.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from David Strauss at UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, good morning, Phebe, Jason, Alison.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Wanted to ask on cash flow. I think, Jason, you comment that you're still targeting 100% free cash flow conversion for the year, through the first half a little weaker than I expected. Can you just talk about what's going on there? The billed and unbilled receivables, and does that stabilize through the rest of the year or partially reverse, and what exactly is driving that? Thanks.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. I guess at a macro level, what we've seen through the first half of the year is really on par with what we planned for the year, so nothing out of the ordinary. We expected a bit of a ramp to the second half. So as I mentioned, still targeting at or around 100% conversion. The build-up in working capital, you mentioned was actually anticipated in connection with the Land Systems' international programs. Really what we're seeing there is as we're moving from what we experienced in the past couple of years with large advance payments and then the burn down of those advance payments, which we've talked about ad nauseam at this point. As we move into production, you're seeing a more typical build-up of the unbilled receivables prior to delivery. And as we then move into a ramp up of deliveries, we'll begin to liquidate that unbilled receivables and we expect to see that to start to turn in the second half, and hence, a bit more of the ramp in the cash flow in the second half. So all part and parcel of moving from the development phase of that contract into production and a subsequent ramp in deliveries. So we'll see that unwind beginning in the second half.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Doug Harned at Bernstein.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: On Gulfstream, Phebe, you've talked in the past about your pipeline being very strong, and I think you're reiterating that today. But one of the things that you've raised is the fact that it's been a little slower converting interest into firm orders. Could you give us a sense from the discussions you're having, and I would say both in the U.S. and abroad, with customers, are there things that are slowing them down, in other words, are they looking for signals, economic signals, you had mentioned Brexit a while back when that happened, what are you seeing holding people back?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Nothing. Actually, no substantive issue in particular, simply more rigor as they move into the contracting process. So I don't see any macro reasons. We have identified none that we've got potential customers who are waiting on the sidelines, it's simply just taking longer for a whole series of reasons. Everything from the introduction of brokers to additional board approvals, so for fleet aircraft purchases. Those are constant, but there's nothing in particular that's driving this other than I think this is just a new regular order. It's going to just take longer from the time you enter the pipeline to the time you sign the contract.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And presumably, your transition to the new models, I would think would be a part of this too?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes. I don't think that there's anything particular about those new models that would change the length of time that we're experiencing. I think that's a structural change. It's simply around timing. It's taking a bit longer, and we've learned to adjust to it.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Myles Walton at Deutsche Bank.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was hoping to follow-up on Gulfstream. I think, Phebe, you mentioned that there'd be no G500 deliveries in 2017. I thought there was going to be one. And then also the sales guidance ticking down, is that the slippage of a few deliveries, or is that just the G500 and maybe used aircraft in isolation?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, there are a couple of things that are affecting the revenue. We anticipate lower – now, we anticipate lower pre-owned, that carries with it, with a lower pre-owned sales that reduces revenue, but increases margin. We have a few – fewer G450 deliveries and then just lots of other puts and takes.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Nothing on the certification, EIS (27:01)?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No, no, we're good with that. We're on track. The certification and flight test program is proceeding very, very well. And Jason can give you just a little bit more color on the – this really is the essence of the change of the impact of revenue recognition.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. I mean, we had talked about for a while dating back entry into service this year, and that's still, as Phebe pointed out in her remarks, the demonstrator aircraft will enter service this year. So we'll complete certification, get type certification, enter that aircraft into service, but that, of course, won't have a revenue implication, that's what she was referring to in her remarks. But nothing otherwise off-schedule or off-plan from what we had anticipated this year.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Robert Spingarn at Credit Suisse.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Just sticking with Aerospace and Gulfstream, you still – despite the sequential downtick, the margins are still excellent, and I would think that mix is trending away from some of the more mature programs, and so how – Phebe, where would you say the G650 margins are today relative to G450, G550 at peak maturity? How much more runway do you have there to offset the mix of the new aircraft as they come in? And then will there be any margin support at some point from reduced R&D or you're going to keep that level?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So the G650 margins have exceeded the G450 and G550 at their peak. And you ask a question that I ask Gulfstream frequently, how much better can we do? And we will do better, the quantum of which we'll have to see. But we've come down our learning curve. That purpose-built facility has turned out to be an operating mix-up (29:10) for us. It's been really nice fit for our guys to be able to get sequential airplane-over-airplane improvement. So I suspect we have more to go. You're never done in the continuous improvement. The R&D, you can anticipate our R&D spending to be about the same level. We have a very robust R&D pipeline, product pipeline, so obviously, that is that (29:38).
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Cai von Rumohr at Cowen.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much, Phebe. So GD always has kind of prided itself on focus on return of capital. With stock prices moving up and your own moving up, reducing the leverage of stock repurchase, at what point does it make sense to shift the focus from repurchase to M&A?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, when attractive, accretive and strategically important target cross our path. So that heretofore has yet to happen. But nonetheless, we don't really comment on this as you well know, but we're certainly not – we're certainly predisposed to be interested should our criteria be met.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Jason Gursky at Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Phebe, I was wondering if we could spend a few minutes back on Marine and have you talk a little bit about your view of the world on undersea unmanned, kind of what that market looks like and what do you think GD's strategy might be and maybe what some of the challenges are in that market? And then maybe just to add on some comments here at the end about the demand out at NASSCO with Jones Act and the LNG products that you can produce out there, kind of what the pipeline looks like for those ships? Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure, sure. So as you well know, we are fully embedded in the undersea warfare element of the Navy's shipbuilding budget. We are – we've been very encouraged to see the Navy's interest in additional SSN Virginia-class. I think they increased recently their shipbuilding plan by 18 SSNs, that's about a 38% increase from 48 to 66, consist of Virginia-class. So that would be very, very encouraging, if that comes to pass. We will see. We're positioning ourselves, as you all know, for the Columbia ballistic missile submarine. The design is going extremely well, and we're on track to begin the build process exactly when we thought we would. So we see the undersea deterrent and the undersea war-fighting capability of the U.S. Navy as a key national security imperative as clearly evidenced by the Navy's interest in increasing subs. With respect to NASSCO, interesting to speculate for a moment, NASSCO has continued to perform very, very well. We have the potential for an additional ESB, I think that would be ESB 6. That's a program formerly known as MLP. And we'll see if that comes to pass. We also have – the Navy's given us long-lead funding for the second oiler, and there's an opportunity to accelerate that program to two ships a year, should the Navy so choose. But frankly, all of this takes money, so we're going to have to see how the budget process shakes out and what programs receive what funding and when.
Operator: The next question comes from Howard Rubel at Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: Hi, thank you very much.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Howard.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: So you've got a whole host of opportunities in front of you, Phebe, and two sort of stand out. One is there's a lot of FMS deals that have been announced, but not yet contracted, and then the G550 platform clearly has a number of military applications that range from domestic to international. Could you put a fence around it or bracket some of this and help us a little bit with timing?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So on the FMS, for those programs that flow through FMS, we expect Kuwaiti tanks and tanks for the Kingdom in the fourth quarter. The tanks for the Kingdom have already received Congressional approval. Primarily, we see the FMS used for tanks, less so on the wheeled vehicle side. We also see FMS for our munitions and armaments business, and that has been proceeding quite nicely, not in the big ticket items that the tanks represent, but nonetheless nice steady volume. With respect to the G550, the G550 is, as I'm sure you know, in service in a number of non-U.S. Air Forces in the ISR mission. And by the way, when we talk about special mission, we mean the ISR mission and we mean Medevac primarily. So – but on the ISR front, the G550 has been in service in some cases for many years in a couple of countries and performed extremely well. To the extent that there are opportunities for the G550 in the U.S. Air Force market, the Air Force will tell you – tell us if they want our airplane. They don't, they don't. We're – Air Force programs, we're not that intimate with the Air Force, so I tend to defer any questions on the big Air Force programs to the prime. But with respect to the G550, I think it stands on its own merit. I think there are also some opportunities moving away from the ISR front if you look at the U.S. Air Force and some potential opportunities to refresh some of the executive transport airplanes. But that is a longer-term potential program. I would note that a number of the airplanes are getting a little old in the Air Force executive transportation fleet. So that's again their call and we'll be prepared to respond to whatever their requirements are of us.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from Seth Seifman at JPMorgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much and good morning. Phebe, I wondered if you could talk to us about the review of WIN-T that General Milley is undertaking and the decision by Senate authorizers to reduce funding and kind of how you see the future of the program from here?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. The Army, as it's been widely reported, reviewing its networking and communication strategy, including, but not limited to, WIN-T. And as you can well imagine, we're working very closely with our customers to respond to any changing requirements. And those will play out over time to the extent that there are any. We don't see any significant risk, by the way, in this year to our WIN-T estimate. To give you just a little bit more color, we have a long-standing, 20-year, networking expertise in land forces – tactical land forces network, and we think that positions us very well to work with our Army customer now and in the future.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Peter Arment at Baird.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, good morning, Phebe, Jason.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Phebe, on Aerospace in particular, I guess, it's been a while since we've talked about Jet Aviation. Maybe you could just give us an update on how that business is doing and is it growing, and what are the prospects you're seeing out there for that?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes. So Jet Aviation is doing quite well. Their services businesses are up, again, primarily driven by increased flying hours. And their completion revenue and earnings are down a bit due in part to reduced inductions from Bombardier and St. Louis, but we're doing very well in Basel on our completions programs as we transition from engineering to production on several airplanes. So Jet Aviation, both on its services side and its completions side, continues to perform very nicely.
Operator: The next question is from Robert Stallard at Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thanks very much. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Phebe, in your commentary, you mentioned that the margin in IS&T was exceptional in the quarter. Does this imply that you don't expect this level of return to be sustained over the medium to long term?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No, I think I meant exceptional in the sense that it was noteworthy, not that it was rare. As I think we're guiding you to margins in the 11.3% to 11.4% range. I anticipate that we will have no trouble in meeting that spot on. I don't expect any upside beyond that. But these businesses have performed very, very well. Our attention to cost, schedule and performance has really driven the bottom line in both those services business and the products business and communications networking and Intel.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: That's great, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Hunter Keay at Wolfe Research.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, thank you. Can you hear me?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Great, thanks. Phebe, a little more on G650, can you comment on how you're thinking about rate there in the next year given the comment on strong demand and how the sales effort for the ER conversions are progressing? And then maybe to that a little more, can you talk about the margin profile on the ER variant, is that really a whole lot different than the non-ER model? Thank you so much.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, I'll take the questions in inverse order. I'm not going to parse the differences in margins between the G650 and the G650ER. But as we've been talking about for some time, G650 production is going to come down somewhat in each of the next three years. We increased the production to help us in this transition period as we move from the G450 to the G500 in particular. And so our expectation, the balancing that we've been doing this year and into next is that as the G650 revenue begins to decline, the G500 and G600 will offset that decline. I might note that the interest in the G650 and G650ER continue to be quite robust. In this quarter, we had the highest number of orders that we've had in the last six quarters for the G650 and G650ER. So that airplane continues to generate an awful lot of interest in the marketplace.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: So there's no thoughts in maybe pushing out the rate cut?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Pushing up the rate?
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: No, pushing out the rate cut, putting it off?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No. I think that as we look at where the G500 is in terms of orders and our production schedule on the G500, we're comfortable that we can offset the somewhat reduced G650 sales. But I think that's just prudent business.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you so much.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Peter Skibitski at Drexel Hamilton.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Good morning, guys. Hey, Phebe, I was wondering if you can go further on your thoughts on the fiscal 2018 defense budget just in terms of the markups and the signals you're getting out of Congress, it still seems a bit muddled over there, especially on the Senate side. And I'm wondering if you see a good path to getting – to eventually getting a budget that's above the President's request or it's just too fuzzy right now?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, if you go back a number of years, I think we used to have insights into the defense budget process, both within any given administration and on Capitol Hill that weren't necessarily widely shared or available. But given the ubiquitous amount of information that flows today, I think you all know as much as I do in terms of specificity. But the President's budget exceeded – the budget request exceeded the budget caps by $54 billion; OCO, the Overseas Contingency fund has often acted as a relief valve for the caps. So perhaps, Congress will consider doing something like that in addition to being able to can never (43:56) adjust those caps. Both the Senate and House Authorization Bills are significantly in excess of the President's budget. And the House Defense Appropriations Committee is about $135 billion, I think, over the President's request. So look, what does all that mean? Right now, it's a giant fur ball and we're going to have to work through the process and see what comes out the other side. As I noted, I believe that there is real interest and desire in additional defense spending which will manifest itself in some more additional funding and budget for defense. It's just a question of how much and what accounts and when. So we still have ways to work through this process.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Thank you very much.
Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Amy, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: The final question is from George Shapiro at Shapiro Research.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, George.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Hi, Phebe. Typical question for you. If you look at the Gulfstream margin in Q3 and assume it's like it was maybe this quarter, it implies the fourth quarter has got to really drop to 16% or so to get to your guidance. And if you're not going to deliver a G500 in the fourth quarter, so what happens in Q4 to get that big contraction in the margin?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I'll let Jason attack that one.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: George, I mean, obviously, we can try to reconcile the math, I don't think ours is worked out exactly as yours is suggesting. That's probably not totally unusual. But I think the two bigger issues are a little bit of a downtick in the number of deliveries in the fourth quarter. We've talked about that as it relates to outfitted deliveries under the new standard versus our old revenue recognition model. So that is baked into plan. And then it's somewhat bit of a mix there. So more significantly the volume of deliveries, there's a little bit of mix issue affecting the margin. But I don't think it's down quite as dramatically as you're suggesting. It is definitely off as implied in Phebe's guidance.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: But let me follow-up, Jason, I mean, you said deliveries for this year would be about equal to last year and the first half is pretty close to the first half of last year. So the Q3 delivery is then going to be a lot bigger and the Q4 one is down, or how does deliveries going to spread out over Q3 and Q4?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. I don't have the Q3 in front of me, directly, I do know that Q4 is off a little bit. I also know that last year was particularly lumpy. The second quarter was a bit of a spike. So we can parse through the quarterly deliveries, but 4Q is definitely off slightly and that's what's the largest impact driving the margin difference.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: You're welcome.
Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3311. Have a great day.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alison Harbrecht, Staff VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter 2017 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Alison, and good morning. Alison has replaced Erin Linnihan, who is now reporting to me in a different capacity. Alison has had a distinguished 14-year career in the finance department, most recently as the Controller for Mission Systems. We are pleased to have her here as our Staff VP for Investor Relations. As to the quarter commentary, I will keep my remarks brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward, quite good, and the comparisons are generally attractive. We reported earnings per share of $2.48 on revenue somewhat in excess of $7.4 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion, and net earnings of $763 million. EPS of $2.48 was $0.16 better than consensus. We estimate that about $0.06 of that $0.16 was from operations in the form of higher than expected operating margins, offset modestly by somewhat lower than expected revenue. The remainder came from a lower effective tax rate, offset slightly by a somewhat higher than anticipated share count. With respect to cash, we had $533 million net cash provided by operating activities. After capital expenditure of $62 million, we had $471 million of free cash flow from operations, $56 million more than in the year-ago quarter. While our total backlog at $60.4 billion is down $1.8 billion from year-end figures, it remains quite robust. It is also significant to observe that the important funded portion of that backlog grew by approximately $1.5 billion to $53.3 billion. An impressive 88.2% of our total backlog is funded. The general comparisons quarter over quarter reflect, as you would expect, strong operating performance. All of the comparisons I will give you are with reference to 2016 numbers as restated for the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules for this year. So, compared to the first quarter of 2016, revenue was down $35 million, or 0.5%. However, our operating earnings were up $111 million or 12% over the prior year's quarter on the strength of a 150 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin in the quarter at 13.9% was particularly strong. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $213 million or 2.8%. But again, operating earnings were up $267 million or 34.8% on a 390 basis point improvement in margin. All of the foregoing is a reflection of very positive operating leverage. Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up $0.40, up 19.2% over the year-ago quarter as a result a better operating earnings and a lower tax rate and share count. Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results in each of our operating segments, first Aerospace. Revenue was up by $293 million compared to Q1 2016, about 16.5%, and up $249 million or 13.6% sequentially. Similarly, operating earnings were up $111 million or 33.4% against the year-ago quarter on a 280 basis point expansion in operating margin. Sequentially, operating earnings were up $169 million on a 640 basis point improvement in operating margin. The sequential result needs to be understood in the context of the restated 2016 revenue and earnings resulting from the new revenue recognition rules. In the fourth quarter, we had nine more green aircraft receive a certificate of airworthiness than we had final deliveries to customers. This negatively impacted Q4 2016 as restated because the green deliveries were no longer recognized. By the same token, we had four more entry-into-service deliveries in Q1 2017 than we had green aircraft receive a certificate of airworthiness. That obviously helped the first quarter of 2017 and should help next quarter as well. Orders for the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, net earnings were $1.4 billion, and the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2012 through 2016. The Aerospace average booking for the first quarter over the last five years were $1.39 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7. So it was a quarter with a lot of sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. In particular, we noted sharp increases in activity levels in Europe and improved activity in China. I should also note that the activity has been good in April and has clearly shifted in favor of large-cabin. This is quite encouraging. On the product development front, we anticipate a late-October completion of all flight test requirements for the G500. This leads us to believe that FAA certification will follow within 60 days thereafter. By the way, we are going to fly our third G600 test airplane today. Think about it this way: We are flying three test airplanes in the first 4.5 months since first flight, really quite remarkable. So we are off to a very good start in the Aerospace group, somewhat better than our guidance to you at the operating earnings level. We expected a strong first quarter for the reasons we discussed with you at the beginning of the year. However, the operating performance was better than expected. Let me turn to the defense side of the business with Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, sales were up $42 million or 3.4%, and operating earnings were up $18 million or 9.6% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. We had particularly strong performance on a quarter to year-ago quarter basis from European Land Systems. Sequentially, revenue was down $374 million, but operating earnings were down only $25 million on a 210 basis point improvement in operating margin. The sequential comparison is particularly difficult on a revenue basis because this group always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries at OTS and ELS. Also in the quarter, we largely completed the transition from engineering and prototype production on our two large international vehicle programs for Canada, the Mideast, and the U.K. These programs will now enter full production and continue apace for the next several years. Even given Combat's large backlog, they had nice order activity in the quarter, with a 0.7 times book-to-bill. All in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems. With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good operating leverage in the quarter. While revenue was down $182 million or 7.8% against the year-ago quarter and down $125 million sequentially, operating earnings of $236 million were essentially flat with the year-ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in margin. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $5 million, once again on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin. These results are consistent with our guidance of an around 11% operating margin. I think it's important to note that IS&T's backlog grew by $255 million in the quarter, with a book-to-bill of 1.1 times following strong book-to-bill of 1-to-1 on average for the last four years. The significant orders in the quarter included a $415 million contract from the U.K. Ministry of Defence to design and develop its next-generation communication and information system; $85 million from the NATO Communication and Information Agency to upgrade its technical infrastructure; and $160 million from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency for the new Campus East. So a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective at IS&T. Finally, let's turn to Marine. Revenue of $1.93 billion was down $188 million or 8.9% compared to the year-ago quarter, but up $37 million or 2% sequentially. Operating earnings were down $23 million or 12.5% against the year-ago quarter and up $119 million sequentially. The revenue variance from the year-ago quarter was solely attributable to lower Virginia-class Block 3 material volume, offset only partially by higher Columbia-class engineering volume and higher repair volume. Earnings were driven by a delay in the scheduled delivery on one ship in Block 3 of our Virginia-class submarine program. Our performance on the Virginia-class program continues to be solid. Also at EB, we are already over 40% complete on the design of the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, four years before start of construction. This performance is far better than any submarine first-of-class design maturity to construction start date in history, so we are pleased. Bath's ship-over-ship performance on the remainder of the DDG 1000s is outstanding, and we have stabilized the DDG 51. NASSCO continues to show performance improvement on each of its ships. So the company is off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not as a practice change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will continue to consolidate our improvements and strive to continue to improve our results. I'd like to turn the call over now to our CFO, Jason Aiken.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Net interest expense in the quarter was $25 million versus $22 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. On the capital deployment front, we spent $354 million on the repurchase of 1.9 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $584 million in shareholder-friendly actions during the first quarter, almost 125% of our free cash flow from operations. We continue to anticipate deploying all of our free cash flow this year to share repurchases and dividends. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.7 billion. As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter. The lower first quarter rate was anticipated based on the timing of the vesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefits and is consistent with our full-year tax rate forecast. So despite coming out of the gate with a lower rate, we're still anticipating an effective tax rate of about 28% for the year. Alison, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Gary, can you please remind the participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: The first question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse: So, Phebe, as you said, good performance across the board. In Marine, you've got a lot going on. I wanted to ask you about that. It's a multipart question, but it really gets to CapEx over the next several years with the Columbia class coming in, a construction contract rumored to be around $5 billion. You have the advanced procurement money that went into the December CR that's nearly I guess $0.75 billion. And then we've got this very ambitious 355-ship force structure assessment, where large surface combatants go up from something like 88 to 104, attack submarines go up from 48 to 66, going from two per year perhaps to three, same with the destroyers. Given that, how do we think about the requirement for you – for GD to invest in CapEx over the next several years?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So let me give you our investment philosophy across the board. We invest in programs that we believe we can earn a sufficient and proper return. So to the extent that those returns become increasingly clear, that then informs our investment, and that's true across the entirety of our portfolio. So I think you need to think about our investment proposition through that lens. With respect to the increase in shipbuilding, to the extent that that materializes and we can understand both the quantum and the timing of those increases, we have the capacity to increase production in each of our shipyards, as does the majority of our supply base. But with all of these – with any increase in production, we would need to replenish as needed our workforce, the supplier base, and facilities over time. And again, all of the potential investments with respect to that growth will be determined with our customer as we begin to identify the return.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse: So, Phebe, would we go through a period where there is some pressure on cash flow from the added CapEx and maybe pressure on margins as you hire and prepare for future higher revenue?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So our current plan anticipates an investment in our shipbuilding program commensurate with what we see the growth to be. So we may see in the out years some cash demands as a result of those investments, but I believe it will be well within our capabilities. And remember too, the cash that's tied up at Gulfstream will begin to unwind naturally as well. So we will consider all of those puts and takes as we think about our investment into the future. You had a second part of that.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse: I was simply talking about the possible impact to margins as you start to hire and so forth, yes.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So we have done a very careful plan on what our margin expectations are. And we see our margins throughout at least our initial plan period of four years as essentially flat in the mid-8% range. And that's because the increase in Columbia volume will continue to be cost-plus, and then offset somewhat by the Virginia-class submarine performance and that long-term successful program as we have continued improvement ship over ship. So think about flat in the near term. As we go out into the future, then it's our job to manage that growth appropriately. And as you can imagine, with all – when you think about shipbuilding, it's all about planning. That's really the competitive advantage and the key to success in shipbuilding. So we have put in place very, very detailed hiring plans, training plans, supplier base plans, and facility plans to support that growth. So as we sit here today, I'm very comfortable that we are both anticipating and thinking through the potential risks of growth.
Operator: The next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks, good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning. Jason, maybe could you touch on the EAC's cume adjustments in the quarter on a year-over-year basis given the new reporting structure? And then, Phebe, I wanted to ask you about Combat Systems and specifically the U.S. business. How prepared are you or your production lines, Stryker or Abrams, for a potential ramp-up there? Thanks.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So as it relates to the EAC adjustments, as you're probably alluding to, we had been expecting with this transition to the new revenue recognition rules and specifically the cumulative catch-up approach to our defense businesses to start to see a little more volatility, perhaps a little bit more in terms of magnitude on this side. As it turns out for the first quarter, in any event, the aggregate number was actually about $50 million and not too different from what we saw a year ago on a restated basis. I think that was $58 million. So still TBD in terms of what we'll see quarter to quarter over time still. We're probably expecting some level of volatility, but for now it was a relatively inconsequential quarter.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So with respect to Combat Systems, there has been quite a lot of discussion in this new administration about potential increases to the land forces in the United States. And to the extent again to which those increases actually occur and the timing and the amounts of those increases, we will look at that as the details emerge. But we have plenty of capacity and plenty of operating leverage both within Combat Systems and within our supply base. So I have very little doubt that we can ramp up to meet any expectations that our customers, both the Army and the Marine Corps, may have in the future.
Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Next question, please?
Operator: The next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Jason, Phebe.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: At the risk, Jason, of asking again the nerdy accounting question on the EACs, just since you guys have never really had this before, is that $58 million – or that $50 million, is that a net favorable/unfavorable number? And if so, can you give us the pieces? And then one for Phebe. I just wondered. You made a statement about stabilizing the DDG 51 at Bath. I just wondered if there was something beneath that, what metric you're looking at in terms of stabilization that gave you the confidence to make that statement. Thank you.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So good question. I didn't clarify that earlier. Both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter were net favorable adjustments. And in parsing that, there was no material up or downs in there on any segment or any program. So there were some positives and negatives, as you'd expect, but nothing material.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So let's talk a minute, and this might be a good opportunity to give you a little bit of color on Bath. And let me break that into two buckets, first the DDG 1000, and then to your specific question on the DDG 51. So we delivered the lead ship of the DDG 1000 last May, and the final two ships of this class are demonstrating very good levels of ship-over-ship learning in terms of labor-hour performance, which is our prime metric that we look at when we look at shipbuilding. And in fact, we experienced the best ship-to-ship learning curve we have ever seen at Bath on that program. So to the extent that there was any risk, I believe that is behind us. With respect to the DDG 51, just to give you a little bit of background, we delivered the DDG 115, which was our first ship after the four-plus year break in production. We delivered that in February. We just floated off the DDG 116. But let me give you a little color here. That four-year break caused us a bit of a challenge, which the DDG 1000 program exacerbated. And I think by way of illustration a recent example can give you a sense of how we've managed through all of this. Before the DDG 1002, we had late equipment deliveries into the shipyard that required us to rephase our production, and it created a production gap between the DDG 116 and the DDG 118. We'll see some learning from ship to ship as we realize steady-state production on this, but the costs associated with those challenges were recognized in 2016. So going forward, I'm very comfortable that the performance at Bath has stabilized. I like where they are.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Phebe.
Operator: The next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah, hey, good morning, everyone. Phebe, just maybe shifting back towards Gulfstream but maybe from a different angle. If Northrup were to win the JSTARS program, how do you think about the impact that could have on Gulfstream across the business, and specifically for the G550?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, it is our practice to refer any questions about JSTARS to the prime, Northrup. But with respect to the G550, let me take some license with a quote that Mark Twain said, that the reports of his demise were greatly exaggerated. We have sufficient orders, both on the commercial side and international orders, for the G550 to keep that production line open for the foreseeable future. So JSTARS would be additive to that if in fact the Northrup team prevails. So I very much like where we are on the G550.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then just maybe as a follow-on to that, broadly speaking, can you maybe characterize more what's going on in the wide-cabin market? Are you seeing any customer hesitation around tax reform, accelerated depreciation, that kind of thing, or are you seeing follow-through with the pickup in the market that seemed to really happen post-election?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So in the first quarter, our activity was pretty much as we've seen for the prior years, but we have definitely seen frankly for about the last solid year now increased interest in our aircraft. And the extent to which we execute on that interest and put all those planes into backlog, that's simply a question of timing. But we're seeing some very nice demand for our products as we have for the last few years, but I do see an uptick. So whatever set of reasons, different customers are motivated by a different economic reality.
Operator: The next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. I was interested in looking at, now that you're getting close to the G500 coming into service, when you look at the ramp for that program, how would you compare that to what happened on the G650? Are you looking at a similar production increase over the next few years to the G650 ramp?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, if you recall, the G650 was the first aircraft that we had a purpose-built manufacturing facility to outfit and bring in assembly and then outfit the airplanes. We experienced and had quite a bit of learning around that – around how we performed during that period. So when I think about the ramp up on the G500, we've taken yet another purpose-built facility, applied the lessons learned on the G650, and I expect and our plan anticipates that we'll have a very nice ramp up both in terms of volume and performance relative to the G650.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And I know there obviously were some problems on the ramp in the G650. But if you look at the size of the program say, and if things go smoothly and say they go smoothly for the G650, is this one that would look at a similar kind of a rate increase over time to the G650?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I think we'd see a little bit in terms of timing and amount a little bit faster, but step back and think about the G500 and the G600. When we entered into the test program, we had retired an enormous amount of risk even before we had our first flight. And at every step of the way on both the G500 and now the G600, we have met or surpassed our milestones and the capabilities that we had designed into that airplane. So the design maturity of even the test airplane is far in excess of what we saw on the G650. So the disequilibrium that I think I talked about back in 2013 where we had a bunch of G650s on the tarmac that we had to go back in and retrofit, we do not anticipate anything like that for the G500 and G600, simply because the test airplanes were really manufactured to production standards. So we'll all go back, and as we have had changes and updates in some design parameters, we've done those at that time. So I don't anticipate – in fact, there's nothing to indicate that we would see anything like we did on the G650. Does that answer your question?
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. And if I can, on the purpose-built facility, because a lot of what happened on the G650 is you made some pretty dramatic improvements in manufacturing processes. I know you've done a lot of work in that regard on the G500 and G600. Would you characterize the potential to improve cost of manufacturing on the G500 and G600 as a step comparable to what you did from the G550 and the G650, and should we see an improvement like that?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Given that we will start out at a higher rate, perhaps the incremental improvement plane over plane may be less than what we saw on the G650, but I think that we are poised to have a very nice learning curve plane over plane in both programs. And that's how we have – all of the analysis that we have done in terms of production preplanning suggests that will be the case.
Operator: The next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much. I will just use the cash flow statement to ask about four questions. No, to be serious for a moment, thank you, Phebe. But to be serious, there are two points. One, to go back to Doug's question a little bit, we didn't see a lot of increase in inventory. And so if we're preparing for reasonable growth in or entry into service of the G500, can you explain the puts and the takes there? And then second, I thought at some point we would get some further advances from some of your international Combat Systems business. And when might we expect that? Are there some milestones related to that? And then just one small follow-up item, could you talk about FirstNet for a moment? Thank you.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Howard, I'll take your first part of your question on the inventories. This is one of the other many underlying subtleties of the new revenue recognition rule that we maybe skipped over at the year-end conference call as we touched on the major muscle movers. But in this case, we used to have a fairly – in the balance sheet categorization – I'll try and be as quick as I can on this. Of these accounts, we used to have what we called contracts in process that was almost exclusively related to the defense business, and inventory that you could pretty – as a general statement, pretty closely correlate to the Aerospace business. The new rules have us categorizing these two accounts as what we called unbilled receivables and inventories now, and it now co-mingles some of the different pieces of the defense and commercial Aerospace businesses. So there were some decreases in inventories associated with the defense businesses in the quarter offsetting some of the increase that we've talked about in the Gulfstream business as we built up on the G500 and G600 programs, so there's a little bit of netting going on in there that you're seeing. But still, the story on the aerospace inventory build and the working capital is consistent with the production ramp we've talked about.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So turning to our international Combat Systems vehicle orders, we have, up until this point, had milestone payments, but we move in this quarter, in the second quarter, into payment on delivery. So we anticipate that we will have a more regular order of cash on the unit of deliveries. And again, we are ahead of plan on our production. So I'm comfortable that the cash flow that we modeled at the beginning of these programs we will execute on appropriately. FirstNet, we have been careful to refer the general questions to AT&T, to whom we are a sub. But we consider this a potential growth market into the future and for many years to come. And again, it will be a nice franchise for us.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Samuel Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I was wondering if you could talk about two different segments in terms of the guidance. Just IS&T, why the revenue looked so weak this quarter, and can you still get that back to up modestly for the year? And I guess if you can address Aerospace, the same thing with the margin, where it is this year would seem as though your low 19% is a pretty low hurdle.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So let me address in the inverse order. We had a particularly outstanding quarter. I think that was obvious. We anticipate that we'll be at about a 20% margin in the second and third quarter and then a decline in the fourth quarter. So as of today, we're still holding to our guidance. With respect to the IS&T revenue, let me talk about two things here. Remember, these are two – the two businesses in that group are short-cycle businesses, so we had anticipated a lighter volume quarter. It was a touch lighter than we had anticipated, largely because as we changed administrations, we had some slowdown in the execution of the contract line items in a number of particular programs. So our view today is that we are very much poised to recover that, and we're holding to our guidance. Let me talk to you a little bit about though – and I think this might be an opportune time – talk to you a little bit about how we built the guidance for this year and equally importantly in the out years. When we built our plans in the fall, we considered only those then-known programs. We factored them accordingly and then built into our plans the attendant cash flow. To the extent across the defense portfolio that we see additional funding, that represents upside to us. That's true in Combat, in the Marine group, and particularly in IS&T. So I think understanding the context in which we built these plans will help you get some sense of our confidence in our revenue estimates for the year as we stand today.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's helpful, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, thank you very much. So, Phebe, as I thought I heard you talk about Gulfstream 500 certification flights into October and then certification two months later, are we talking about certification late in the year? And is that consistent with still hitting some initial deliveries in the fourth quarter?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: This has been – there's nothing that has changed in our plan with respect to certification from the FAA. And I think our plan anticipated, and we're on track to do that, one delivery. We'll have multiple green airplanes, but just right now we're looking at one completed entry into service airplane on the G500, again consistent with what we have been anticipating.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And then based on what you said about the margins at Gulfstream, I think on the fourth quarter call you talked about the quarterly earnings pattern, given where you started the year. Could you maybe update us because if the margins are going to go down in the fourth quarter, on paper that would seem to be a tougher compare?
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: One thing I think we talked about in January on the call was with – and I think we talked about it in light of the transition to the new revenue recognition rules, how we were anticipating having a stronger first quarter, and Phebe went into this in her remarks about the green deliveries, the extra green deliveries in the fourth quarter of last year and how those would translate into more outfitted deliveries in the first quarter. But as we then went out of the year, we had been anticipating green production, as she just discussed, of the G500s, which would now be deferred till they're outfitted deliveries into 2018. So while the year guidance is what it is, the slope is a little bit different than perhaps typical with the stronger first quarter and a little bit of that shift in the fourth quarter because of that transition to the G500. So I can't reverse-engineer it for you here specifically, but I think that slope is what we alluded to at the end of the year and consistent with Phebe just described earlier.
Operator: The next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, good morning, everyone. Phebe, I wonder if you could spend a few minutes back on Aerospace and talk a little bit about services aftermarkets at aviation. Just maybe describe a little bit about the current demand environment, particularly on the completion side of things for Jet, what you're seeing in cycles, and the aftermarket for the existing Gulfstream fleet. And then talk a little bit about the longer-term outlook for your businesses there, some of the recent M&A activity we've seen there, and some of the other investments that you're making, and what your view is on the longer-term growth outlook for Aerospace Services? Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So our Aerospace Services business did very well in the quarter, both in terms of volume and particularly at Gulfstream in terms of volume and margin. And the service business is somewhat cyclical, but we have continued to improve our operating performance on our service end at Gulfstream. With respect to Jet, we've got a nice pipeline of opportunities in the quarter. They're a bit of a drag on a book-to-bill basis in the quarter, but we expect a strong second quarter on the completions side in terms of demand. And the demand at Jet Aviation has been pretty consistent for the last couple of years. It's somewhat lumpy, so as we – the additions into backlog of new orders have been a touch lumpy on the completions side. On the services side, we've been making a series of very targeted small investments to augment our FBO capability and our managed fleet capability. One of the things I'm particularly pleased about is that we've seen additional synergies between Gulfstream and Jet Aviation as we have matured Jet and begun to provide them additional resources and assets to support Gulfstream worldwide, and we're continuing that path. So completions business steady, lumpy in terms of order activity. But on the service side, we see nice growth in the future, and we're very pleased with the performance of the investments we've made heretofore.
Operator: The next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was wondering if I could circle onto Gulfstream just for a second. The fourth quarter margin of 19%, is that more indicative of the completions that were carried over being better margin than the first half of 2017 and the flow-in of initial deliveries of the G500? And what does that tell us about 2018? You've talked about the top line growth in 2018, but I don't think you've said if the EBIT grows in 2018.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So, as it relates to the fourth quarter, I don't know if you can state it that simply. As always, the quarter-to-quarter margin in the Aerospace business is going to be the result of a number of factors. We've touched on them from time to time over the years. Obviously mix is an important part of that. You alluded to that, so there's a piece of that there. But it's also the level of pre-owned activity, the service business, Jet Aviation, R&D. All of those have meaningful points that can move you 10, 20, 30, 40 basis points in a given quarter on each of those particular items. So I wouldn't chalk it up to any one influence, but that's what the mix is shaking out to be as we're looking at the fourth quarter.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So when you think about margins and earnings too, but let's talk about – let's go back a couple years ago when we – as we entered into this transition from the G455 and G50 to the G500 and G600, we told you all that our goal was essentially flat earnings. And we were going to accomplish that by feathering in some additional G650. We've done that, but on top of which we've had superior cost control and nice operating leverage at Gulfstream. So that's combined to allow us to meet that commitment. As we go into next year, we are anticipating – we haven't given you specific year-over-year guidance on margins, but we're going to bring down that G650 production a touch, as you would expect as we move up the ramp on the G500 and then ultimately the G600. So when you look at – the past has to be prologue. When you look at the operating performance of Gulfstream, I am very comfortable that they'll do nicely on their margin performance. But we're not going to get into 2018 details until we get a little bit further. In fact, we'll do it at the end of the year, as is our constant practice.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, all right. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Thanks so much, good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on this whole continuing resolution situation, whether you've seen any impact of that, particularly on your short-cycle businesses, and what your expectations are if this should drag on.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: The Congress – the customer has made it quite clear to the Congress on the impacts on national security of failing to enact a budget. That said, we've done an analysis of a potential full-year CR, which we do not anticipate. But if we actually experience a full-year CR, the impact on our 2017 is not material. So that tells you something about the strength of our backlog, by the way.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: So there's been no impact in IS&T that you've seen so far?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No, not yet, other than it's a little slow to execute on some of the contract task orders, but we anticipate that increasing.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: That's great, thank you very much.
Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Gary, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: And the final question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much, good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Phebe, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the M&A landscape these days and whether anticipation of a growing defense budget causes you to look at anything differently or whether high valuations remain a deterrent.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So I have an answer that I've been giving for the last four years now under the fifth, and it's we're not going to comment on M&A. It's simply not appropriate. You all understand the landscape, and we haven't seen much changes in valuations, so no real change.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, fair enough. And maybe I'll sneak in another quick one then. And maybe as you talk about – thinking about the business jet market and where you think about the opportunities longer term, I guess, as you think about investing in new platforms, not necessarily a specific plan, but whether you'd think about smaller or large, and also your future plans for the G280.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Let's answer this in this regard because any more specificity is inappropriate. You can expect that we will continue to have a robust R&D profile to fund new product development now and into the future. That's our business proposition. And in that regard, we're going to stick to our knitting. We're going to stick to our market in which we have excelled, and frankly we're the only company to fully excel. So steady as she goes, past is prologue.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thank you very much.
Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Great, thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3311. Have a good day.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff VP for Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Erin Linnihan: Thank you, Gary and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full-year 2016 conference call. As always any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken. 
Jason Aiken: Thanks, Erin and good morning. I'd like to open by congratulating Phebe on welcoming her first grandchild into the world yesterday. Mother, son and grandmother are all doing well. Phebe is with the newest edition to her family right now, but she left us well-prepared to report our results on this call. I'd also like to welcome Kim Kuryea, our Vice President and Controller to the call and thank her for joining me today. Congratulations Phebe, welcome Kim, now let's get started.  Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.62 per fully diluted share, on revenue of $8.23 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $807 million. The results for the quarter beat analyst consensus by $0.08, mostly on a lower than anticipated tax provision. Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year-ago quarter, by 5.4% and 7.8% respectively.  Earnings from continuing operations are also up $43 million on the strength of a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin, offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.22 or 9.2%. So in summary, against the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue is up 5.4%, operating earnings are up 7.8%, earnings from continuing operations are up 5.6% and fully diluted earnings per share are up 9.2%.  Sequentially, the story is just as wholesome. Revenue is up $502 million or 6.5% and operating earnings are up $48 million or 4.5%. Earnings from continuing operations are also up by $40 million and similarly, earnings per fully diluted share are up $0.14.  So all-in all a very solid quarter, with good performance all around. The marine group's improved performance, both quarter over quarter and sequentially, is notable. In short, we were very pleased with the quarter.  For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.87, on revenue of $31.35 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $3.06 billion. We had full-year margins of 13.7%, a record for GD. Revenue for the year is down $116 million, somewhat less than 0.5%. Operating earnings on the other hand are up $131 million or 3.1%, on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins.  Earnings from continuing operations are up $97 million or 3.3%. This, together with share repurchase activity and a lower than anticipated effective tax rate, led quite naturally to an 8.7% improvement in diluted earnings per share. This was a very good year, a year of continuing improvement, a year of accomplishment.  Free cash flow from operations is $678 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.81 billion which is 59% of earnings from continuing operations. As we had advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to be as robust as is typical for us. It was in fact less than 100% of net earnings. This happened for two reasons.  First, we were working off the very large advanced payments received in late 2014 on a major combat systems program. And second, we expected an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous test aircraft and pre-production parts in connection with the G500 and G600 programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively, beginning this year.  In 2017 we expect free cash flow to be approximately 100% of net income give or take a little. We should keep this kind of cash performance up throughout the planning horizon.  Let me briefly give you some color on the quarter in each of the business groups. First, aerospace. Revenue was up both quarter over quarter and sequentially. Against the year-ago quarter, sales are up $82 million or 3.8% and operating earnings are up $26 million or 6.3%, as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in margins. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $207 million or 10.3% and operating earnings are essentially flat, as a result of the anticipated compression in operating margin.  For the year, revenue is $8.36 billion and operating earnings are $1.72 billion, with an operating margin of 20.5%. This is a year-over-year reduction of 5.5% in sales, almost $500 million, but operating earnings are up $12 million for the year on 120 basis point improvement in margins. All in all, a very good year at aerospace, with strong operating leverage and decent order intake, particularly good in the last half of the year.  This result was consistent with our guidance to you that we would hold earnings even with 2015. As I mentioned, earnings were actually up $12 million over 2015. Order activity in the quarter was good and pipeline activity was actually robust. The book-to-bill at aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8 to 1 dollar-based and 0.9 to 1 in units of green delivery at Gulfstream.  All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good. The second half of 2016 was actually strong from a pace of activity standpoint and interest in the G500 and G600 is increasing nicely, as we get closer to entry into service with these aircraft.  At combat systems, revenue was $1.68 billion and is up $160 million or 10.5% and operating earnings are up $25 million or 10.7% on a quarter-over quarter basis. Sequentially, the story is even better. Sales are up $354 million or 26.6% and operating earnings are up $40 million or 18.3%.  For the full year, sales are down $38 million or 0.7%; however operating earnings are up $32 million or 3.6%, on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat lower revenue and stronger operating margins.  Overall, combat systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. As you'll learn later in my remarks, this is a business group poised for quite significant growth in the 2017 to 2020 time frame, as we begin delivering on our backlog.  Marine group revenue of $2.04 billion in the quarter is up $59 million or 3%, compared to the year-ago quarter and essentially flat on a sequential basis. Operating earnings are up $14 million or 8.1% against the year-ago quarter and up $20 million or 12% sequentially.  Revenue for the year is up $189 million or 2.4%. Recall that this year's $189 million increase in annual revenue follows a $701 million increase in 2015 and a $600 million increase in 2014. That's more than 20% growth for the group over that three-year period.  On the other hand, operating earnings for the year are down $3 million on a 30 basis point reduction in operating margins, so the story here is a good quarter on both a quarter-over quarter and sequential basis. On an annual basis, we experienced better than anticipated revenue, but not as good as expected operating margin which left us relatively flat year over year.  In the information systems and technology group, revenue in the quarter is $2.28 billion up $123 million or 5.7% against the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $244 million in the quarter are 6.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are down $12 million or 4.7% on a 20 basis point reduction in margins and a 2.4% reduction in sales.  For the year, revenue was up $222 million or 2.5% and earnings are up $89 million or 9.9%, on the strength of a 70 basis point improvement in margins, very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast flat operating earnings for the group, so this was a very strong year for IS&T.  On this call a year ago, on a Company-wide basis, our guidance for 2016 was to expect revenue of $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3% and a tax rate of 29.5% and return on sales of 9.1%. We wound up the year light on revenue with $31.35 billion, but we exceeded our earnings expectation with operating margins of 13.7%, an effective tax rate of 27.6% and a return on sales of 9.8%.  Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.20. We wound up at $9.87, $0.67 better. About $0.23 of the improvement came from better than planned operating performance, $0.25 from a lower than planned tax rate and the balance, about $0.19, from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly, a very solid year by any measure.  So before we go to guidance, I want Kim to make a few remarks and then talk about the fundamentals of our accounting rule adoption for 2017 and the restatement of 2016 under these new revenue recognition rules. All of the guidance I'll offer you for 2017 and for 2018 through 2020 as well, will flow from the restatement of 2016 which is found in Exhibits K-1 through K-3 of the press release. Kim? 
Kim Kuryea: Thanks, Jason and good morning. I'll start out by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance. The first thing I'll note is the foreign exchange rate volatility that we've seen throughout 2016. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our combat systems group, given their increasing international activity. As Jason pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 0.7% compared to 2015, but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the Euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group sales would have actually increased by 1.5% in 2016.  As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. What we're talking about is merely the translation of our various international businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with the strengthening U.S. dollar.  Net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million, compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, interest expense was $91 million, versus $83 million in 2015. The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt, yielding more interest expense and about a $450 million reduction in our cash balance associated with capital deployment activities which resulted in slightly lower interest income.  For 2017, we expect net interest expense of around $110 million. The increase is due to the full-year effect of the increased debt and the lower cash positions. We ended 2016 with a cash balance of $2.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.6 billion. That compares with cash of almost $2.8 billion and net debt of about $600 million at the end of 2015. Those changes are attributable to our capital deployment activities which I'll walk through in just a minute.  Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the year, very consistent with our 2015 effective rate of 27.7%. Our 2016 outcome was lower than anticipated, principally due to the higher than expected benefits from increased international activity and employee stock option exercises during the year. As we look forward to 2017, we expect an effective tax rate of about 28%, reflecting the fact that our international activity continues to increase and the tax benefit associated with stock options being a permanent part of the tax landscape.  Let's move on to our pension plans. We contributed about $200 million to our plans in 2016, as forecast. For 2017, we expect that amount to be about the same, to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. A quick note on discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter, we had a net $10 million loss in discontinued operations to record an accrual for an environmental matter related to a business we divested back in the early 1980s.  Finally, to summarize our activities on the capital deployment front for the year, we spent approximately $2 billion to repurchase 14.2 million shares in 2016, at an average price of a little less than $143 per share. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we disbursed $2.9 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2016 or 1.6 times our free cash flow from operations for the year.  Okay, that wraps up the discussion of 2016's financial performance and some expectations for interest expense, tax and pension contributions. Now, I'd like to move on to an explanation of our 2017 accounting change.  On January 1 of this year, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard, ASC topic 606 which addresses revenue from contracts with customers. This new standard outlines a five-step model to determine how and when to recognize revenue on a contract-by-contract basis.  For the vast majority of our contracts, we will continue to recognize revenue over time, similar to what we've done in the past, under the percentage of completion method. But for contracts that don't qualify for overtime revenue recognition, we'll recognize revenue at a single point in time.  As we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q and in today's press release exhibits, we expect this new standard to have two notable impacts on our contract portfolio. The first change relates to how we will account for adjustments in our estimates associated with our long term contracts. Starting in 2017, we'll utilize what's called the cumulative catch-up method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This is similar to what others in our industry have done for many years.  In 2016 and prior, we use what's called the reallocation method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This meant that any changes in profit we anticipated on our long term contracts were recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, rather than immediately when identified under the cumulative catch-up method. As a result of this change, we may see larger and more variable impacts from period to period from adjustments in contract estimates, particularly on our contracts of greater value and with a longer performance period, such as in our marine systems group.  The second notable change that the new standard will have on our financial statements is in our aerospace group, specifically at Gulfstream. Starting in 2017, we'll have one revenue recognition point for Gulfstream aircraft, when the customer accepts the outfitted aircraft at entry into service.  This is different than the revenue recognition model we utilized in 2016 and before. Our past practice had two revenue recognition points at two distinct contractual milestones, green aircraft delivery and final outfitted delivery. It's important to note that these two changes and any other changes brought about by the standard impact only the timing of when we recognize revenue and earnings and do not alter our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.  Now to prepare for an effective discussion of our 2017 guidance which is based on the new method of revenue recognition, we need a consistent foundation as a point of comparison. Therefore, we restated our 2016 results as if we had been on the new revenue recognition standard for all of 2016. You can see the restated results for 2016 in Exhibits K-1 through K-3 of our press release.  Throughout 2017, as we speak with you and report in our Form 10-Qs, we'll compare our 2017 financial information to the restated 2016 results, so all of our comparisons will be on the same basis. I don't intend to walk you through all of the changes that you can see by examining the exhibits to our press release, but as you can see on Exhibit K-1 for 2016, as restated, both our consolidated revenue and operating earnings decline against the as-reported numbers.  Similarly, the margin rate and diluted earnings per share follows suit. The biggest driver of this change is in aerospace. Please refer to Exhibit K-3 in our press release. Since under the new standard, revenue at Gulfstream is now driven by outfitted deliveries, our restated 2016 revenue is lower, as we had fewer outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. Operating earnings are similarly impacted. Likewise, operating margins go down due to mix shift between outfitted deliveries and the green deliveries.  On the other hand, as we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q, the impact on 2015 would have been just the opposite, because in that year, there were more outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. There is no other change in cost, pricing, R&D, SG&A spend or services revenue or margins. This is strictly related to the timing of the aircraft deliveries.  So the question is, how will all of this impact aerospace in 2017? Well, Jason will give you detailed guidance shortly, but in general, some of the 2016 green deliveries, in excess of the completed deliveries, should deliver in the first quarter, thereby giving the first quarter a boost versus the restated fourth quarter.  That will be offset later in the year as we experience planned green deliveries that do not enter into service during the year. This natural phenomenon will be exacerbated by a number of green G500s that will not have revenue recognized at green delivery because of the new rule.  So on balance, for the year, a modest accounting headwind for 2017. In short, the impact of these changes depends on the number and the mix of green versus outfitted deliveries, in any period. Okay, let me wrap up by reminding you of something that I mentioned earlier in this discussion. This is about an accounting change that in some circumstances alters when we recognize revenue and earnings, but does not impact our operations, our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.  When you sit back and think about the restatement of 2016 and prior, everything that's occurred and been reported up to that point, may have shifted around between the quarterly and annual reporting period, but if you look to the end of 2016 and recognize that the operating activities and cash flows of the Company are unchanged up to that point, this is all about timing. We just have to look at the past through a new lens, so that we can have a meaningful comparison to our future results.  Jason, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you to address the 2017 guidance. 
Jason Aiken: Okay thanks, Kim. So let me provide some guidance for 2017 and some commentary on 2018 through 2020, initially by business group and then a Company-wide roll up. This year, we did a more detailed and extensive planning exercise around the three-year period subsequent to 2017, so I want to take this opportunity to share with you our expectations for that period, as well.  In Aerospace, we expect 2017 revenue to be $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016 as restated, but coincidentally similar to 2016 as reported. Operating earnings will be approximately $1.6 billion, with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. The margin rate is somewhat lower than prior experience under the legacy accounting rules, as a result of mix shift and increased R&D spending, as well as an anticipated increase in pre-owned aircraft sales.  In aerospace for the five year period, 2016 through 2020, that is 2016 as restated, we expect the sales CAGR of 5.3%. That CAGR rolls up modest sales increases in 2018 and 2019, with significant growth in 2020. For the same period, the operating earnings CAGR is expected to be 5.9%. These percentages are of course imply a degree of precision that isn't possible in out-year forecasting, however, we believe they are directionally accurate.  In combat systems, we expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% in 2017, with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. This implies a margin rate of around 15.6%. For the period 2016 to 2020, the expected sales CAGR is about 8.7% and earnings CAGR about 9.6%.  Combat systems is in a period where several of our international programs are migrating from development, prototyping and low rate initial production, into full scale production. This supports the growth rates I just discussed.  The marine group is expected to have revenue of $7.9 billion, a reduction of 2.6% against 2016, as restated. Operating earnings in 2017 are anticipated to be $680 million to $685 million, with an operating margin rate around 8.6%. The 2016 to 2020 sales CAGR is expected to be 5%, with the strongest year-over-year growth in 2018. The expected earnings CAGR for the marine group for 2016 to 2020 is about 9%.  Finally in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue in 2017 and operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a 2016 to 2020 CAGR for sales and earnings of 4.5% and 5.3% respectively. So Company-wide, all of this rolls up to $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion of revenue, up over 2016 restated numbers by more than 2.5%. Operating earnings of $4.15 billion to $4.2 billion, up over 2016 by about 11.5%. And operating margin around 13.3%, about 110 basis points above 2016 restated.  Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 28% tax provision as Kim mentioned and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures, so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55 for fully-diluted shares, up about 10% over 2016 under the new accounting rules.  With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it's a bit more balanced than most years. Divide our guidance by four, then take $0.10 off the first quarter, $0.05 off the second quarter, add $0.05 to the third quarter and add $0.10 to the fourth quarter and that should give you the rough progression.  So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment. With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2017 for dividends and share repurchases which will give a boost to the EPS guidance I've just given you. The amount of that boost will depend on the timing and share price.  For the period 2016 to 2020, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 5.6% and an operating earnings CAGR of 7.1%. This is simply a roll up of the projections I've given you for the business groups, so we're quite bullish about 2018 through 2020 in all segments.  Now, let me end my remarks there and we'll start taking your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jason Gursky with Citigroup. 
Jason Gursky: Jason, maybe you could just provide a little bit more color on the dynamics that you've seen at Gulfstream, starting off with the perhaps order activity on the 500 and 600, what you saw in the quarter? You talked a little bit about a robust pipeline and then just talk about the profitability there and the trajectory for that into the out years. We talked about $1.6 billion for this year with a nice CAGR going forward. So what does the shape of that hockey stick look like as we move out into 2020? Thanks. 
Jason Aiken: Sure, so look as it relates to order activity, as I mentioned, we really saw a very encouraging increase in velocity in the second half of the year and that really is representative across the entire model portfolio, including the new products. I think what we're seeing here is, as we expected, as both the G500 and G600 get closer to entry into service, we're starting to see that order interest continue to pick up, so we feel very good about where those airplanes are as they get closer to the EIS, their respective EIS dates.  Overall as I said it's not just order activity which again we felt very good about in both the third and fourth quarters, but it's the velocity into what we think of as the pipeline. What comes in sometimes is not the same as what goes out. We have talked about extended or protracted contract negotiations and the timing it takes to get aircraft contracts signed and completed and as good as we saw the second half from an order perspective, we saw just as encouraging velocity from the pipeline perspective going into Q1 which gives us a good bit of optimism as we start this year from an order perspective.  With respect to your question about the out years, as I mentioned you saw you heard the remarks on 2017 and the CAGR for the out year period, I think what we see is, as we're transitioning with the real ramp of the 500 starting in 2018 and the 600 starting in 2019, we'll see modest growth in each of those years from their respective entries into service and we'll see more of the acceleration of the growth starting in 2020, when both of them are fully up and have ramped into the production. 
Operator: The next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. 
Sam Pearlstein: Jason, can you talk a little bit about the free cash flow conversion you mentioned, returning to 100% in 2017? It's a multi-part but does it continue through the planning period and can you address CapEx specifically over that period? Because I'm just trying to think about how CapEx ramps around the Columbia class ramp-up during that period. 
Jason Aiken: Sure, certainly, as we've been signaling through this couple of year period, where we have seen lighter than our traditional cash flow conversion, it has been our expectation, our forecast that we would be back to our traditional 100% conversion rate starting in 2017. We have a high degree of confidence in that and we actually do see that as a sustaining trend. This is not a one-time thing, but we do expect to be able to keep up that level of conversion in that range throughout this planning horizon that I described.  As it relates to free cash flow or excuse me, CapEx, typically somewhere in the ballpark of 2% of revenues is where we tend to end up around CapEx. That of course depends upon the timing and phasing of various projects across the business, so it can perturbate a little bit back and forth. But certainly what's coming on the horizon with Ohio will bring with it some investment. We're still in the very early phases of discussing what the profile and timing of that looks like with the Navy and so I don't think we're prepared to discuss any type of outsized CapEx investment in any one year, beyond what I just described. But it certainly, we do not see it affect any of that overall conversion rate through the planning horizon that I just described. 
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. 
Peter Arment: Jason, on Gulfstream is there a way that looks like to quantify how many jets have shifted out of 2016 into 2017? Looks like from a completion standpoint it's more like 10 aircraft. Is there a way you can help us bridge that? And then also regarding just a clarification on the G500 expecting certification this year and initial green deliveries, are we expecting any completed deliveries? Thanks. 
Jason Aiken: Sure. So you're pretty much right as it relates to the green aircraft shifting from 2016 into 2017 and that's really what Kim was alluding to. Again do keep in mind that green aircraft will shift, including G500 green aircraft, will shift from 2017 into 2018. So this is something that I think is more of an issue in this immediate transition as you try to think about 2016 prior to restatement and 2016 under the restatement and then how you take that restated 2016 to then project 2017.  I will point out one notion. Of the number you see in those exhibits around the difference, the delta between the green and outfitted airplanes. We do have a number of, I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, but a number of aircraft that are associated with special mission programs and those get inducted directly into the special mission process and don't go through a completion, so there's a natural delta there and I'm sure Erin can give you numbers after the call, if we need to get into that level of detail.  As it relates to the G500 certification, we're still on track this year. Everything is going well with the flight test program and we're still targeting certification and entry into service, meaning outfitted delivery prior to the end of the year. 
Operator: The next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. 
Myles Walton: Jason, the restatement in the accounting had a material impact on the non Aerospace businesses on 2016, but I think in the Q, as related to the restatement of 2015, it didn't really. So can you walk us through why the restatement had the effect on 2016 but not on 2015 in a material way and walk us through that one? 
Jason Aiken: Sure. Look, as Kim described there really is just one primary meaningful difference that we're talking about as it relates to the defense businesses. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to understate what the team has done here to go through this process, because there's a lot of smaller puts and takes, but the big ticket item is this move from the prospective method of accounting for these changes in our long term estimates, to the cumulative catch up method.  So the issue there is there's no one thing you can point to, that can say this is directionally indicative from a trend perspective. Because what's happening here, every quarter every year across the portfolio of these programs, we're performing updates to our estimates to complete and we're making adjustments across that portfolio to our profit booking rate margins on those programs.  So as we do that in a given quarter, you're going to have some programs go up, some programs go down. As you've seen with a number of our peers who have pretty much all been on this method, even prior to this point, that can lead to somewhat more volatility under the cumulative catch up method than we have experienced under the perspective method. I think you can reasonably expect somewhere in the reporter of magnitude, if you compare them to us historically, 2 times or so the level of quarterly profit adjustment-type impacts on the results.  Am I saying, that's what we will see in the future? I wouldn't be foolish enough to try and predict that but it's all going to depend what happens in a given quarter. What you saw in 2016 was that there were a handful more profit rate adjustments that had little to any impact under the prospective method in those periods, but when you take them all in one lump sum, they just drove a little bit more of that anomaly, a little bit more of that perturbation from quarter to quarter.  So this is what we're going to frankly have to get into in a little more detail with you in the future, when and if these things happen. And as we said, we fully expect that somewhat increased level on volatility on a quarterly basis, to be part of our story in the future. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. 
Ron Epstein: Just maybe a broader big picture question, when you're willing to offer a plan like that, that goes out a couple years, a lot of companies won't do that and it's a change for you, obviously. How do we think about the conservatism that's built in as you step out over year one, year two, year three? Given I'm certain you are conservative, but how should we think about the conservatism built in that you are willing to share that with us? Does that make any sense? 
Jason Aiken: It does. I would suggest this up front. There's nothing that's changed about anything you can infer about the historic current or future conservatism of this Company. It is what it is. I think the couple key points, those longer term out year CAGRs and forecasts that I directionally gave you, those are strictly rolled up from the operating plan, as submitted by our business units. So this is what each of those individual business unit presidents sees, as they look out over their horizon, mine their backlog and determine the trajectory of their businesses.  We're seeing, frankly, a very good news story that we're bullish on across that period and so given the restatement here in the period and the fact that you're having to retune 2016 as you now look at and evaluate 2017, we frankly just thought it would be useful for you to get a little bit more of a picture, so you weren't left in isolation with the two data points make a trend or not, because that could be a tough expectation for anybody assessing the results.  So we wanted to show you a little bit more directional color on where we see the businesses going. And we think as we see that type of growth now coming over that period across the Company and really shared by all four of our business groups, that combined with the demonstrated operating leverage we think we've been able to bring to bear, really offers us some great earnings trajectory over that midterm planning horizon. 
Ron Epstein: One follow on, if I may. When you look back over what happened in the fourth quarter, did you see a pick up in pipeline activity, tire kicking, however you want to call it, post the election at Gulfstream? 
Jason Aiken: I have not heard anything anecdotal specific to that from the guys down at Gulfstream. As I said, the fourth quarter was very encouraging both from order and pipeline activity standpoint, but I certainly don't think I have enough color to attribute that either to post election or otherwise. 
Operator: The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. 
Cai von Rumohr: So in aerospace, you noted that the accounting change would have a negative impact on 2017 and yet looking at the numbers, it looks like there are 16 more green deliveries of large biz jets where you make your money, so that if those catch up you pick up 16, that's the math, in 2017 and if you are really going to get a G500 out the door and booked into revenue in 2017, by my math, it would look like this would actually have a positive impact, because there's 16 planes where the greens happen, the greens happened already, so you basically pick up the 80% on those 16 planes. So help us understand that, if you could. 
Jason Aiken: Sure, so the planes you refer to, as I mentioned, the 16 is a little bit of an overstatement because they were somewhere in the ballpark of a half dozen or more handful of these special mission airplanes that don't flow into completions so they are done and out. But again I think the key to remember is, what we're trying to do here in the moment and this I believe is last time we'll do this, because green deliveries, will just fade out of the discussion from this point forward. But when you're trying to think about in the moment, as we transition between the old rules and the new rules, some of the instinct might be, as you've articulated, that wow you get to recount the value associated with these green airplanes that didn't deliver outfitted at the end of 2016.  But you have to keep in mind, that was going to happen at the end of 2017 as well, so there's an output on the other end that's that natural flow of the business. And if you think of this as a steady in production model, the 650 to 550 to 450 to 280, you'd expect that similar cadence coming out the other end. So if you just leave it at that, it's essentially a net neutral or close to it anyway, where Kim articulated it as a modest headwind and when I say headwind, it's an accounting artifice headwind, it's not a business headwind.  What's happening there is we would have had, if you imagine a G500 entry into service before the end of the year, there's quite naturally a handful of green G500s that are incremental to those in production aircraft, that are also going to tilt out of 2017 and into 2018, so on balance, we would see more of an outflow if you will or a tilt out of the year in 2017 on the back end, because of that phenomenon around the entry into service of the G500. Even then we're seeing as a tilt in flow from the end of 2016 into 2017. So hence our attempt to try to high pressure you understand in the moment, as we transition, what the impact of the shift of the new rules is on Gulfstream. 
Operator: The next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. 
Carter Copeland: Jason, I wondered if you could just clarify the adjustments in marine on the restatement were obviously quite large and the go-forward margin that you're implying for 2017 in the mid 8s is a bit different than we've seen in recent years. Was there something about a booking rate change or anything from the shift away from perspective there, that's a go-forward difference that we should be noting or is that just coincidental? 
Jason Aiken: I think really there's nothing, as I mentioned before. In the moment, when you look at individual quarterly performance and in this case try to examine the difference between how the results looked under the perspective method and the [indiscernible] catch up method it's really a function of what were the booking rate changes on those programs, in that portfolio, in the moment. So when you look at it, the third quarter was actually higher because we had on balance favorable booking rate changes in the fourth quarter across that portfolio, on balance had some negative booking rate changes.  Again under the prospective method, as you are well aware and we talked about many types that gets cast out over the future, so there's virtually nil effect in the moment when you make those changes. You can see in the results, it had more volatile effect under the cume catch up method. I don't think you can take that and translate or extend that into what does it mean for the margin rates or the business in 2017 and beyond. Those are pretty much disconnected, I think.  Really it's a function of, as you know, we've experienced some cost growth at the Bath shipyard on the settlement of the A12 program and some of the work we're doing on the DDG1000, as well as restart of the 51 program there. So that's well documented and discussed and we're working our way through that and we have every expectation we'll get that shipyard back to where we want it to be, as quickly as we can. So that's one influence and the other is of course, as we add more and more volume around the cost-plus Columbia class development effort, that of course is going to be dilutive in terms of margins, with respect to how it compares to fixed price full rate production programs, so that's really more what you're seeing going forward. 
Operator: The next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. 
David Strauss: Jason, with regard to the long term forecast for the defense businesses, obviously, you guys have had to make some assumption around the budget over the next couple of years. Can you talk about what you assume there, if it's just sequestration or not? And then on aerospace, it might be helpful just to kind of calibrate us, if you could talk about over that planning period what the ranges of completed deliveries, I guess more importantly, large cabin completed deliveries? Thanks. 
Jason Aiken: Sure, so look as it relates to the Defense budget, I don't know that there's anything more fundamental assumed than what we're seeing which is notionally upward directional budgets that underpin and support the defense programs across-the-board. Really what it's about more so is what's in the backlog. We've developed a historically high backlog across the Company and now we're all about executing that backlog.  So a good share of what you see, particularly in combat systems and in marine systems is all about just executing on that backlog and continuing to perform the way we have. So that gives us a great deal of confidence about that trajectory that I described.  As it relates to aerospace, so I alluded to before, if I had to guess and I don't want to commit Phebe but I'm fairly certain, this will probably be the last time we talk about green deliveries, because it's all about outfitted deliveries in the future. So to your point right now as we look at 2017, we're projecting somewhere in the range from a large cabin perspective of call it 90 to 95 outfitted deliveries and from a mid-cabin perspective, somewhere in the range of 25 to 30 deliveries. As you are well aware, we tend not to look out beyond one year because we set production rates and work through those customer contracts on an annual basis, so we'll continue to update that on an annual basis, but that gives you a sense of what we're seeing as we head into 2017. 
Operator: The next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. 
Howard Rubel: On your backlog, it's down a little bit sequentially and I know some of that's attributable to timing. Could you do two things for us, Jason? One, provide us with a little bit of an indication of the pipeline for combat systems? We know there's a lot of things in the FMS pipeline. And then second, how do you see, you talked a little bit about Gulfstream, but where are some of the open slots for opportunities for sales? 
Jason Aiken: Sure. So you mentioned the backlog is down just slightly sequentially and something important to point out there, particularly as it relates to combat systems. Kim alluded to the foreign exchange impact in that group, as it relates to our annual sales. You have to keep in mind there's equally, if not more so, an impact on what you will, the balance sheet for sales, that is the backlog. And so we saw something on the order of magnitude of a $700 million reduction in combat systems backlog in 2016, as a result of that FX headwind. So that gives you a sense of what's happening there.  In terms of opportunities in the pipeline, you're right. It is quite robust, both on the domestic and the international front. We've got a number of competitions. There's an 8x8 vehicle in the UK, there's opportunities in Poland and the Czech Republic, follow-on work in Austria. Really the list goes on and on throughout both Europe and the Middle East for combat systems, as it relates to international programs.  Domestically, we're looking forward to the ramp up with recapitalization efforts and so on, as it relates to Stryker ECP, Stryker Lethality, with the 30-millimeter gun, Abrams upgrades, Marine Corps Labs, really it's just a very encouraging and robust list for this group, again both domestically and across-the-board internationally. So really exciting to see.  Your last part of your question, aerospace slots, I think fundamentally the thing, the way to think about this is, with the good order activity we saw in the quarter, we continue to be encouraged by our EIS next available slots for the various aircraft. The 650 remains essentially consistent with where we were last time, 24 months or so. The 550 remains in the 12 month range, 450, we actually only had one aircraft left to sell so we should get that behind us this quarter which by the way I think is a great testament to this transition and the way Gulfstream has handled this.  When you think about it from both sides of the spectrum, on the one end there was the speculation about could we get the 500 into service when we said we could and doing what we said it would? And certainly, the test program it's demonstrating so far that it's meeting if not exceeding all of our expectations for what the airplane can do and Phebe mentioned a quarter ago, we've now officially pulled that EIS in from first quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017.  So that's on one end of the spectrum, but this point about one 450 left, possibly the more difficult aspect of this transition was managing the supply chain, the order activity, the inventories and so on to close that out in a timely and secure fashion, without exposing the Company and manage this transition and so far so good. So that is really encouraging, so that's what we see on the horizon from an EIS perspective for the various aircraft. 
Erin Linnihan: Great. Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, Erin can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2016 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Erin Linnihan - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Chelsea, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Erin. Good morning, all. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 for fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion and income from continuing operations of $767 million. This is $0.20 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.10 per share better than consensus. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was down $263 million or 3.3%. Operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.4% increase, and income from continuing operations is up $34 million, a 4.6% increase. This quarter's operating earnings of $1.07 billion reflect a 13.8% operating margin, 90 basis points better than the third quarter 2015. By the way, this is the eighth consecutive quarter that we've had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion. Sequentially, revenue is up $66 million, almost 1%. Operating earnings are essentially flat and operating margin is down 20 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, revenue is off $540 million, a 2.3% decrease. However, operating margins are up 50 basis points and earnings from continuing operations are up $54 million, a 2.5% increase, once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations. Earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.57 or 8.5% over last year. I should point out that the entirety of the year-to-date revenue decrease is attributable to Aerospace, as we forecasted in January. The defense businesses have actually shown some modest growth year-to-date. With respect to cash, we have $389 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 51% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.1 billion year-to-date, 50% of net income from continuing operations. In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $348 million, offset in part by the exercise of 1.5 million options. We have purchased approximately 11.2 million shares year-to-date for about $1.5 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts and somewhat in excess of this year's free cash flow, much as we did last year. As a reminder, in 2015, we had free cash flow of $1.9 billion and spent $4.1 billion on share repurchases and dividends. This year, we have spent $2.2 billion on share repurchases and dividend year-to-date compared to a free cash flow of $1.1 billion, a delta of $1.1 billion. We will continue to use our balance sheet prudently and appropriately for the rest of the year. In short, we are honoring our word in these two years of low cash flow and using our balance sheet to offset lower cash. As you can see from the charts attached to our press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was good contract activity in all segments, with particularly strong order intake at Gulfstream. We ended the quarter with a total backlog for the company of $62 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter. Of that amount, $51.4 billion is funded. Let me say a few words about each of our groups. Let me start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue is down $326 million or 13.9% compared to the third quarter of 2015, in line with the production cuts to the G450, G550 and, to a lesser extent, the G280, that we had previously discussed with you. Also remember that Q3 2015 was the group's highest ever revenue quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings increased $11 million or 2.6% to $437 million on an operating margin of 21.7%, a 350 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. This is a real tribute to the operating efficiency of the Gulfstream and Jet Aviation teams. By the way, this is the ninth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million and the highest ever margin for the group. On a sequential basis, the group experienced $117 million reduction in revenue, 5.5%, but a $3 million improvement in operating earnings and 140 basis point improvement in margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $571 million or 8.5%. Operating earnings are down $14 million or 1.1%, a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin. On the call last quarter, we advised that we were quite optimistic regarding order activity in the third quarter. Our optimism was well founded. We had strong order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9:1 book-to-bill measure in dollar value of orders. Gulfstream alone was about 1:1 on a dollar value basis and 1.2:1 on a number of units basis. The distribution of these orders is also attractive, with the G650 and 650ER leading the way. I can also tell you that our pipeline of prospects grew, and our active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look much like the third quarter. By the way, this was the strongest discrete third quarter since 2011 for orders. Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter with revenue of $1.33 billion, operating earnings of $219 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue is off $15 million but earnings are up $1 million on a 30 basis point improvement in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $15 million and operating earnings are flat. Year-to-date, revenue is down against 2015 by $198 million or 4.8%. Operating earnings are up $7 million or 1.1% on a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin. Combat Systems remains on course for a very good year, and we fully anticipate that their fourth quarter earnings will see a 30% increase in revenue. All of our major programs are performing very well in Combat. Our cost performance has improved. Our competitiveness positions us well for the future and through rest of the year, by the way. We continued to see opportunities for growth both internationally as allied nations continue to see increased emerging threats and domestically as the U.S. Army and Marine Corps begin to recapitalize their equipment. The Marine group reported revenue of $2.04 billion, a $44 million or 2.1% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. However, revenue was up sequentially by $56 million or 2.8%. Year-to-date, revenue has increased by $130 million or 2.2% to $6.2 billion. Operating earnings for the third quarter at $166 million are down by $15 million compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis in the quarter as a result of a onetime charge at Bath on their restart of the DDG 115 and DDG 116 program. This charge flows through to the sequential and year-to-date comparisons as well. IS&T, well, IS&T continues to outperform somewhat our revenue expectations. Revenue of $2.34 billion is up $122 million or 5.5% against last year's quarter and up $112 million sequentially, also a 5% increase. Year-to-date revenue of $6.9 billion is up $99 million or 1.5% over last year. Operating earnings of $256 million are up $37 million or 16.9% compared to the third quarter last year on the strength of a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings are up $12 million on a 10.9% operating margin in both quarter. Year-to-date operating earnings are up $75 million, an 11.1% increase on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margins higher than expected. Really strong performance by IS&T. So, what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? Well, stronger than expected operating results in the quarter, a lower than planned tax rate and modestly lower share count enabled us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operation goes from $9.70 to $9.75. This late in the year, we anticipate our end of year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance. And finally in closing, as tempting as it is this time of year for some of you to ask about the following year, let me just remind you that we have a planning process in the fall when these businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. That guidance, which we give to you in January, is grounded in that process and as a result, it's full and thorough. So, I don't want to prematurely piecemeal at this juncture. I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations. Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 aircraft contract in our former tactical military aircraft business, retiring in excess of $1 billion in potential risk to the company. In connection with that settlement, we provided various forms of consideration to the Navy including the release of some rights to the potential reimbursement of costs that affected all ships under contract at the time at our main shipyard. As we've progressed through the ship building process, we've determined that the cost associated with this settlement is greater than the parties anticipated. Therefore, we recognized an $84 million loss net of taxes to adjust the previously recognized settlement value. As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility. It's still not material in the aggregate, but it continues to be a slight top line drag on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue declined by 1.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015 but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar held constant from 2015, the group's sales would have remained steady quarter-over-quarter. Moving on to interest expense, the net expense in the quarter was $23 million, similar to the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $95 million. In July, we repaid $500 million of maturing debt with cash on hand and subsequently issued $1 billion of new debt in the quarter. Despite the net increase in long term notes, our net debt position remains unchanged from the end of the second quarter at approximately $1.6 billion. We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion after deploying over $550 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. We funded our pension plan as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2016 to approximate $200 million. Our effective tax rate was 26.8% for the quarter, somewhat lower than we expected as a result of tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the high 28% range. Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has the chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Chelsea, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So, Phebe, just a quick question. I know you don't want to get into much detail on 2017. But if I just rewind a little bit, I think in the past, you mentioned a goal, a longer-term goal of getting to double-digit earnings growth. If we think about the margin performance that the company has done this year, how should we think – is double-digit a reasonable starting place for 2017 when we think about where earnings could go?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Wow, so much for not getting into 2017. Look, we have, as a goal, double-digit growth, but it's too soon for me to tell how 2017 plays out. So, if you want to ask another question, go ahead.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Sure. Okay. So, thank you for that. So, maybe just a follow-up on – in the quarter, you mentioned that sales at Gulfstream were good, right? And you have book-to-bill of 1 or over 1, depending on how you want to measure it.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Order. Yeah.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Can you give maybe a little more color on kind of regional distribution and how G650 was doing? Because as you know, there has been worry about sales of G650s, that kind of thing.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. So look, you asked about the regional distribution, and I think it's worth stepping back a moment and talking in the general and then in the specific. And let's start by talking about the market, and let me try to give you some insight into our market. Let's start with, for example, the Honeywell study, which measures deliveries, not orders. Deliveries in the business jet market are down, including somewhat at Gulfstream, right? So, the good and valid reasons that we have discussed during our transition, discussed with you previously during our transition from the G450 and G550 to G650 or G550 and G600 or G500 and G600. Deliveries, however, are based on retrospective orders, so 12 to 24 months previously. And for Gulfstream, from an order perspective, we have seen and continue to see nice demands. So, it would appear that we have been taking share from others in our space and as the G500 and G600 enter into service, we really anticipate that we will continue to take share. I've been reluctant in the past year or so to get into a share discussion because we really are about – not about share but really about profit, but it would appear that we are indeed taking share. So, I think that understanding where we are positioned today and how our position going forward will help you. It would also appear, specifically to your question, that we are far less dependent on the BRIC countries and on, frankly, any one particular region outside North America. And our demand, consequently, has not been as perturbative as others have seemed to be. So, it gives you a sense of I think where we stand in the market and how we see it in general. Now, let's dig down a little bit deeper into Gulfstream, and let's just think about this. So, from a Gulfstream perspective, again as measured by our sales pipeline and order activity with respect to demand, both are stable and sufficient to get us through to the new aircraft. I mentioned that the third quarter orders are the strongest in five years and interestingly, both our fourth quarter activity to date and the pipeline are good. If we think about Gulfstream more specifically, let me talk to you and just give you a little bit of color without getting into guidance. This is just color in the most broad sense. The G500 will most certainly make a contribution in 2017 and a significant one in 2018. The amount of the 2017 contribution, of course, will be dependent on the timeliness of the certification. The G600 should make a contribution in 2018 and a significant contribution in 2019. So, why am I confident in talking to you all about this? I'll tell you why. It's because the test program for both airplanes are going very well. The G500 is doing well in tests and should be certified and entered into service in 2017, as implied by what we've just talked about. The G600 will fly this quarter and should be certified and enter into service, and all are on schedule with some forward bias. Thinking about, again, just broadly, our market in Gulfstream in particular, I've always been of the view that a new plane needs 50 solid orders before the commencement of initial production to have a good start. Well, the G500 is going to exceed that number, which is quite good, especially when you consider that our sales force has been incentivized to focus on the G450 and G550. They'll now be incentivized to turn their attention towards the G500. So, with respect to used airplanes, some of you have been very concerned about that. Let me talk to you a little bit about where we are in the used market. We see, in the G650 market, I think there are about 19 to 20 airplanes that are up for sale, but as we deconstruct and analyze those potential aircrafts, we see maybe 12 to 14 serious sellers, dedicated sellers. So, that's well within the 10% of the 200 and some – 203, actually, G650s that we've got into service, and we haven't seen any impact this quarter on our new order activity or our order activity from the used market. And with respect to the G550, the used market is about 7% of the 700 or so aircraft in service and so, we haven't been affected by that either. So, I notice that was rather a soliloquy, but I think your question about the distribution of our market I think was particularly just – gave me an opportunity to talk to you guys a little bit more fulsomely about the market. So, I hope that helped.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. That does. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Phebe, I guess following up on that. You've talked about Gulfstream EBIT holding flat through this transition period. Is that still the official line given the pull forward on the – it sounds like a bit of a pull forward on the G500 and G600 and with the G450 going out of production?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, you're quite right. We said that we're going to try – we intended to keep earnings as flat as we could and the margins as high as we could during this transition period just to be a bit cyclical and frankly, so far, I think we've done a pretty good job. We'll get into 2017 after we set our production rates and got a little more clarity into the market, but that still remains our goal to give you those higher earnings as we possibly can and margins as high as we can.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Quick, quick follow-up. Marine – how much was the charge of Marine on the quarter?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: It's not material.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: But I wanted to mention it to you so you just at least understood what was going on.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you, Phebe, and congratulations. Terrific performance at Gulfstream.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Cai.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Can you explain to me, I mean, for the deliveries that you made, which were pretty much in line where we were guessing, we had less profit by $30-million-plus. So, was it lower R&D? Was it supplier payments? Was it forfeitures? Was it better margins? What got you to a number that strong and is that likely to repeat in the fourth quarter?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, as we've talked before, Aerospace margins and Gulfstream, in particular, are variable quarter-over-quarter. But what you're seeing here is a result of the Gulfstream team doing a superb job taking costs out as their revenue has declined. And they've done a very good job at that in the quarter. R&D was somewhat lower. We had some timing issues at Jet Aviation. I don't anticipate that performance going forward in margins, but they will continue to do quite well.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Phebe and Jason.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a quick one on how you think about the transition to the G500, G600 from a margin or a cost standpoint, I guess. Clearly, it's come out that you'll end the G450 production in 2018, and you just made a comment about the contribution you expect from the G500 and G600 and how that layers in, in 2017 and 2018. But with those aircraft being produced in different facilities, how should we think about the ramp down on the G450, and then eventually the G550 and how that impacts the overall cost structure of the segment? Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Okay. We've talked the last year or so about how we're going to manage the transition as we wind down the G450 and G550 and then bring on the G500 and G600. And the key there is matching the shipsets, the wings, the fuselage, the engines with the number of airplanes that we have left to sell or left to deliver. And so far, with the G150 for example, we got it spot on. We're on track to get that perfect correlation on the G450 and I expect the same thing on the G550. So, I don't anticipate any decrease in margins as a result of our failure to make that transition really comfortable and profitable. That said, as we, look, think about it. Any time you have a mix shift, which is what Gulfstream's going to have, right. You're going to have a mix shift as we go from older production, long-running lines, long historic learning curves, as we enter and start to produce and deliver G500s and G600s. But I will tell you, if you look at the G650 by comparison, and let's just use that as our baseline, the G650 margin performance was faster and higher than the G550 before it. So, that means it's coming down its learning curve and we're seeing gross margin expansion earlier than we had ever before. So, the lessons that we have learned on the G650, we are translating into how we go about the production on the G500 and G600, and that gives me an awful lot of confidence that this team is going hit the ground running. They have some margin compression as we begin to deliver, as we come down those learning curves, but our ability to come down those learning curves as we've demonstrated, I believe is going to go much, much faster. And remember too, there's a fair amount of commonality between the G500 and G600. So, I suspect that the ignition coming down, when we bring that G600 into full wave production, it's going to be pretty impressive. I got to tell you, I like where we are. I like where we're headed. We're moving through this transition period like I told you we were going to do, and we're in good shape for real revenue and earnings growth as we get these two new airplanes into service.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Phebe.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. I wanted to ask you about Combat Systems. You made a comment about the sequential growth you're going to see in the fourth quarter. And just to get to your annual guidance, you do need something like a 35% sequential increase. So, can you talk a little bit about what drives that?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So, the fourth quarter revenue increase is driven primarily by a couple of things. The Canadian, Mid East order and our AJAC programs as they move from engineering and low rate production in the third quarter into full rate production in the fourth quarter. So you're going to see some real – and by the way, we got this – Combat has this analyzed down to a fine level of detail, and we have that growth in our backlog and we are positioned on both of those programs. So those are going to drive it primarily. But recall also Combat tends to have very robust revenue growth in the fourth quarter across the portfolio, and we'll continue to see that in OTS and ELS as well as Land Systems. So, there isn't much ambiguity this late in the year with the group that really understands their products and how they're going to then begin to execute.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And if I can follow-up a question just in terms of the other Mid East Abrams order that Congress has been pushing back on. Is there a certain timeframe when that has to come in until it starts to affect your production?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, I'm not sure why you think they're pushing back on it. Frankly, they approved. If you're talking about the 100, in September, they approved the 133 M1A2 Saudi Main Battle Tank request, so that's good to go, it at contract.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: All right.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Phebe, I'm curious about that comment you made about the sales force having their incentives change around the new programs slipping to the G500 and G600 from the G450, G550. Can you help me understand a little bit how, first of all, when that happened? And how material of a change is this in their own lives? Is this like a significant driver of their compensation structure? Or is this a small thing in their bonus? I'm just kind of trying to think about ...
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well look, I'm not going to get into how we pay them.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: No. I don't want to know how much money they make, but just...
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: But to give you a sense, just in general it's the case here is that the sales force is incentivized to sell whatever products we, at the moment, are focused on. And so their bonuses are a significant part of their compensation and it's up to us to give them the direction of where we're going have them focus. So, this has been a very effective sales force as I think you can see from our order activity.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Oh, sure. Did this change within the last few months? Or has this been in there for six, nine months, something like that? Or is it just like something a change effective at the end of the year?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, look, think about it. The G450 we've announced – that line is going to end, surprisingly, right? These replacement aircrafts, by definition, are going to replace airplanes that we're winding down and the G550 has continued to have very nice order activity. So, we're pretty confident that it's time now to move more robustly to the G500. And let me tell you, even incentivized as they were, as I mentioned in my remarks, we have sold quite a few. So, we're in pretty good shape here.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Howard.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: Hi, Phebe. I'm so inclined to ask a Gulfstream question, but you've answered them all.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Oh, go ahead.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: No. I won't do that. Instead, talk a little bit about Information Systems and Technology. I mean, you've stated that there has been a change and it's sort of taking on your growth profile. Can you elaborate a little bit upon what some of the pillars are that are behind this and how you'd like to shape it going forward?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: All right. Let me kind of take that in two parts. And let's start with our book-to-bill because I think that that reflects a lot of different moving parts. In the quarter, we had a book-to-bill about 0.8:1, and that's solid for this short-cycle business. And think about it in terms of the last eight quarters, or eight of the last 11 quarters for this group have had a 1:1 or greater book-to-bill, which is really quite exceptional in the short term for short, these highly transactional businesses. So, that gives us the platform for some of this ignition. And in terms of where we're focused, on our platform side, we've got a number of growth opportunities across our platform portfolio. In our ISR business and space payload markets, cyber, nuclear weapons and avionics. So, I like where they are there. On our IT side, we have had nice book-to-bills, and we've got a number of wins that we've had across the entirety of the portfolio. And I'll tell you, if you remember, we also have the census in there, which would be a nice cost plus award fee program for five years, and we like how that fits into our low risk cash generating portfolio. And then going forward, we've got an awful lot of competitions coming up, and we tend to announce those as we win them or we put them into our backlog. So, the diving board for our growth is there in our backlog, and because these businesses have really reduced their cost and increased their competitiveness, their book-to-bill has been wholesome for quite some time now and I expect it to be going forward.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: And then actually, I do want to, as a follow-up, you know if you do the flight hours on the G500, you're clearly ahead of schedule. Can you provide us a little bit of an indication of when you think in the first half of 2017 you might get the cert?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I think first half is a touch ambitious, but I'll be able to give you in January a lot more clarity when we get the full certification timeline from the FAA. But I'm very confident we're going to cert in 2017.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I wanted to ask on Marine, on the Ohio Class Replacement Program, because the scale of that program is so large that one would expect it to transform Electric Boat in the next decade, and particularly if we see Virginia class stay stay at two per year.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: That's my view.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, when you look at it – can you talk about the general trajectory of revenues and earnings over the next five years as you move toward the first ship? And also, what investments might be needed to really set Electric Boat up for the scale of operations that will ultimately be there?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: All right. Let me give you a little bit – because this is such a big program, let me give you a little bit of detail on what's going on, on the Ohio Replacement. We have had the design contract now for about five years, and we're proceeding nicely apace. As you know, we're the prime contractor for the design but not the sole contractor, and the prime contractor for the construction. So, our schedule is right on point to start the conception of the lead ship in 2021, and I would imagine that – well, I expect that our profile on revenue between now and 2021 where we'll really begin to see the real ignition, will be driven by a couple of things. One, we'll continue to have further design work on the Ohio, which will begin to ramp down as we get closer and closer. But starting perhaps in 2019 – I think we're anticipating 2019 – we're likely to see long lead production, so we can actualize the ship production construction in 2021. So, as you know, these submarine programs take – require a fair amount of long lead material in order to ensure that you stay on your construction schedule. So, to give you a sense of where we in the design and the component development. Well, we have proposed a detailed design and, actually, all the component development design to the Navy earlier this summer, and they'd like to give us an award by the end of the year. And you know what, when you think about these large nationally strategic programs, one of the most important things that we all get right is that the costs are well understood. And so one of the things that's been driving our work the last three years is a bottom-up analysis of the full cost of construction. So that'll be an important element as we work through those costs with the Navy. And once we get some clarity about the schedule and the pace, then we'll be able to have more clarity about specifics on that production ramp because it will all be very public and obvious.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: When you look at Electric Boat though, this will really change what the operations look like up there. I mean, how do you think about planning for that?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well look, I'm sorry, you did ask that, my fault. We have begun making the investments over the last five years. The investments are primarily funded by the Navy, but we will also and have been putting some of our capital in and will continue to because, well look, we invest in lines of business that have high returns for us and good returns for us and this is one of those lines of business, and it is transformative. You put Ohio on top of Virginia and there's going be quite a lot of workload. So we have spent the last five years both getting our facilities in place. Our design tools are mature. the design to build tools are also very mature, and we need to get our work force because we're going to have this increase in volume. We're going to be bringing in a fair number of green labor. We have a robust education program in the trades with Rhode Island and Connecticut and that will provide us the foundation to really be able to start full rate production on schedule on the Ohio Replacement and continue on Virginia class. Shipbuilding, one of the competitive advantages in shipbuilding is that detailed planning is critical, and that's something that Electric Boat has excelled at for decades and has demonstrated yet again in their preparation for the Ohio. So we have detailed hiring plans, training plans, CapEx plans with the Navy, and of course our design work that we also have in lock step with the Navy on. So, this is all about preparing for success and so far, so good.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: First one is a clarification. Phebe. I think you said that you were going to do repurchase and dividends slightly ahead of your free cash flow. I just wanted to clarify, and maybe I misunderstood. I thought previously it was the 100% of the net income and you kind of make up the difference for repurchase in cash flow.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So Myles, I think we've used a couple different terms in the past. We've talked about normalizing versus the lower free cash flow in these couple of years. But I think the key point is we had had a tremendous amount of cash on the balance sheet coming into the past couple years. A lot of that was timing for a number of the things that we've talked about over the past several quarters. And at this point, the key is we are committed to using that balance sheet to again sort of normalizing that free cash flow at a lower level to return that capital.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: And look, think about it this way, we've long been talking about these two years of fairly low cash flow. We need to normalize that cash flow and augment it by our balance sheet and we've done that. I think about it more like, where are we in cash flow, where are we on the balance sheet, and what resources do we have to continue to go buy shares and other investments as needed. And I think we've managed that pretty prudently. So I think about it as where our cash flow is and where are our cash deployment, where our cash flow is and what our balance sheet looks like and we've been pretty consistent.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And the conversion for 2016 you think can still get close to the 2015 conversion level at 65%.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: We'll have to see on that. But we've got plenty of powder on our balance sheet. So, there's been no material change from the guidance that we gave you back in January about our cash flow.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Think about it that way.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, Phebe, Jason.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi.
Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. On the cash flow, you've had this drawdown on the advances in Combat Systems on the large contracts you talked about before. The Middle East lab and the AJACs and you've got the growth in Q4, but does that trend continue next year? Is there any concern that the Middle East customer might slow the intake of deliveries especially as those cash advances get exhausted and just given lower – the potentially scarcer resources over there?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, let's talk about the Middle East for a moment in general. And this particular customer, we have had a 50-year productive relationship with the Kingdom. And the vast preponderance of all of our combat programs are government-to-government and the contracts have been – products have been fully vetted and supported and these all happen to be products that the customer wants and needs. So, we have seen no indication from the end-user customer that there is concern on their part or an intent on their part to change the profile of these – of our deliveries. And look, we will – we got these large advances and we've been working those down and then we'll continue to refresh cash flow as we – from these customers as we increase deliveries. And so far, we're in pretty good shape.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And if I could just ask one more, Phebe, maybe for Jason, but a follow-up to Doug's question. On this design release, on Columbia, Ohio Replacement that's upcoming, could – if the timing is there and the CR doesn't get in the way, could that be an inflow about $700-million-plus of design money to you by the end – before the end of the year or maybe early next year?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Look, we will work with the Navy. I haven't planned on and haven't looked at the specific timing of the cash flow with respect to that order – of that contract, because we don't have the contract signed yet. So, as soon as we get that contract, we'll have real clarity about the timing quarter-by-quarter of when we can expect the cash associated with that. But there's no way to estimate at the moment until that contract is signed.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Right. The reason I ask is because it sounds like DoD could be making some kind of decision in early November.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, they are. They're making their Milestone B decision, which is predicated on that submission that we just made on the components – detail design and component design. So, that is a trigger. But once that decision is made, then you got a good contract, right?
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Fair enough. Fair enough. Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: And Chelsea, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly. And our last question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is now open.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning. Phebe, just a quick clarification. I want to make sure I heard you correctly. You said you have got 50 orders on the G500?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No. What I said was that it has been my experience that you – to have a successful launch of a new airplane, you need to have 50 orders before entry into service and we on our way to exceed that amount.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful.
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: That helps?
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, it does. Thank you very much. And then, looking out to 2018, you suggested that the G500 will contribute in that year and then meaningfully – excuse me, in 2017 and meaningfully in 2018. You've also suggested in the past that you've got some delivery slots that are available on the G650 out there in the second quarter of 2018. Just wondering if you could update us on that. And what I'm trying to figure out here is whether you're going have enough in the orders on the G650 to hold production flat out there in 2018? Or if the plan here is to begin taking production rates down on that and having any hole from an EBIT perspective that gets created by the G650 decline and then filled in by the G500 and that's kind of the key to the recipe of holding EBIT flat through these transitions?
Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. So look, what we said all along is that – we use that wonderful word feather – we'll feather in additional G650s. But that production rate during the transition is not sustainable nor healthy and that we would never intend to keep that production rate up. What we aim for is to keep our backlog on G650s on any of our programs, particularly that one, between 18 months and two years and we're now at two years again. So, as we think about that, I mean, that order book is there for the two – we've got now two years next available, so that ought to give you a little bit of color on how we intend to think through as we set our deliveries and our delivery schedule. But I have not set, and we haven't set until later – late November or mid-November our production schedule for next year. So, on the fourth quarter call, I'll give you copious detail what we plan on doing. Okay?
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Dynamics Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff VP for Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Candice, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter Conference Call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Erin, and good morning. As you may observe from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $7.67 billion, and net earnings of $758 million. We reported EPS of $2.44 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-ago quarter. We were also $0.13 a share better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that the self-side anticipated about $200 million more revenue, lower margins, and a somewhat higher tax rate. Compared to consensus, we had about $30 million more in operating earnings on higher margins, $10 million less in taxes, resulting in about $40 million more in net earnings. The big driver in the quarter was the operational performance. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $7.67 billion was $217 million lower. However, earnings of $758 million were up $6 million on a 30-basis point improvement in operating margin, and 140-basis point lower effective tax rate. I should note that our earnings in the year-ago quarter included a gain on the sale of our Commercial Cyber business. Excluding that gain, there is a 60-basis point improvement in operating margin. Sequentially, revenue was down $59 million, or less than 1%, and earnings from continuing operations were up $28 million on a 40-basis point improvement in operating margins, and a lower effective tax rate. Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2016 and compare it to the first half of 2015. Revenue was down 1.8% against the first half of 2015. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $15 million. Operating margins were 30 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $20 million. EPS was $0.36 better. In short, we are off to a good start, ahead of both our internal plan and external expectation. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance shortly. But first, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year, and wrap that into our EPS guidance. First, Aerospace; Aerospace had a very good quarter. Revenue of $2.13 billion was $124 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $434 million were only $5 million less on a 90-basis point improvement in operating margins. Importantly, on a sequential basis, revenue was up $147 million or 7.4%, and operating earnings were up $23 million or 5.6%. For the first half, revenue at $4.12 billion is off $245 million against last year, reflecting planned production cuts to the G450 and the G550, offset in part by increased delivery of the G650. However, earnings at $845 million are off only $25 million on a 60-basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $845 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, we are well-positioned to achieve or exceed our earning goal for the year. By the way, recall that last year we told you that we had in Q1 a positive supplier settlement. Absent that contribution, earnings would actually have been up this year. So let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter, and then some observations about the current state of the market. First, on a numerical or unit basis, we had 50% more orders than we did in the first quarter. However, the mix was not as advantageous. In other words, think about it this way, we sold more mid-cabin in the quarter than in the first quarter. So the dollar-based book-to-bill was not much better. About a third of our orders in the quarter were mid-cabin. Activity and interest level were good throughout the quarter. But at the end of the quarter when many transactions typically closed, activity almost ceased as a result of the events associated with the Brexit vote. However, those customers did not go away, and are continuing to pursue transactions with us this quarter. We are quite optimistic regarding third quarter sales activity. Active prospects are very good, better than at any time in the year. The U.S. jobs report earlier this month, slightly improved economics stories in the U.S., and to a lesser extent in Europe, coupled with the quick market recovery from the initial Brexit vote reaction, seemed to have accelerated the activity level on our prospects. We fully expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. You may recall that the G500 made its first flight in the second quarter last year. This month, it made its international debut at the Farnborough Airshow. T4, that's the fourth test article, made the flight from Savannah to Farnborough in 6 hours and 55 minutes, traveling at a steady 0.9 Mach. Flight test is going very well, and we are on or somewhat ahead of schedule. We look forward to the first flight of the G600 late this year. Let's take a look at Combat. They had a very solid quarter. Revenue was $1.32 billion, $93 million less than the second quarter last year. However, a 60-basis point improvement in operating margins resulted in a modest $7 million increase in operating earnings over the year-ago quarter. All-in-all, very good operating leverage and an outstanding 16.7%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $42 million or 3.3%, and operating earnings were up $2 million, about 1%. For the first half, revenue was down $183 million, or 6.6%, against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings, on the other hand, were up $6 million on a 130-basis point margin expansion. Pretty impressive operating performance. Work is progressing quite well on our international orders, with prototypes in production for both our AJAX program and our Canadian Mid-East (8:08) contract. We were also awarded a contract to begin fast ceiling (8:13) of the up-gun Stryker. With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $1.99 billion was $14 million lower than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were off $6 million against the year-ago quarter, and operating margins were off 20 basis points. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $144 million due to timing on submarine material purchases. Operating earnings were down $11 million, resulting in a modest 10-basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, revenue of $4.1 billion was up $174 million, or 4.4% against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings were essentially the same on somewhat lower margins. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us, and will continue to be so. We have some work to do on margins in the second half. Turning to IS&T, that group continues to do well. Revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $244 million were up against the year-ago quarter $14 million and $7 million, respectively. There was a 20-basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive when one considers that the sale of the Commercial Cyber products business contributed 100 basis points of margin in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $104 million, but operating earnings were down only $4 million, or 1.6%, on a 30-basis point improvement in margin. This 10.9% margin is the strongest in nearly five years. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was down $23 million, 0.5%, and operating earnings were up $38 million, or 8.4%, on a 90-basis point improvement in margin. So once again, very strong operating leverage. This group also tells a story about building the backlog through the first half. Book-to-bill at about 1.3, which marks the eighth quarter in the last 10 quarters the group has achieved a book-to-bill equal to or greater than 1:1. In short, we believe all this leaves us poised for a good second half. So turning to guidance. Let me provide you some guidance for the year for each segment, and then compare it to what we told you in January, and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue somewhat lower than 2015 and margins somewhat higher than 2015, leading to flat operating earnings. We now expect to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion of revenue, with margins slightly above 20%. This implies a slight pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the third quarter. This will result in operating earnings the same as last year or even slightly better. Despite all the handwringing by some, these two businesses will continue to perform well. So for Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of approximately $5.8 billion, and margins in the mid-15% area. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.7 billion, and margins at 16% to 16.1%. Revenue will see strong uplift in the fourth quarter. The difference in revenue guidance is simply from timing. For the Marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $8 billion and margins in the mid-9% range. We now expect revenue to be between $8.1 billion and $8.2 billion, and margins around 9.2%. For IS&T, we guided to revenue of about $9 billion and margins approaching double-digits. It now appears that our revenue guidance was good, with slight upward pressure, and that operating margins would be somewhat better than 10.5% for the year. So all of this rolls up into revenue for GD of about $31.5 billion, operating margins of 13.7% to 13.8%, net income somewhat more than the $3 billion, and a return on sales of around 9.6%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue, but higher operating income on higher margins, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70. To help you further, our original EPS guidance was $9.20 per share. The $0.50 difference is $0.24 from operations, $0.09 from a lower tax rate, and $0.17 from share repurchases. If you think about the progression for the remainder of the year, third quarter should be somewhat weaker than the second quarter, but much like the first quarter, followed by a very strong fourth quarter. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jason Aiken, our CFO.
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year, and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. This continues to be focused in our Combat Systems group, and when you compare that group's results to the first half of 2016 to the similar period a year ago, our 2016 revenue would have been higher by approximately $75 million, had the exchange rates that prevailed in the first half of 2015 remained in effect this year. And for the company as a whole, revenue would have been a little over $100 million higher. Moving down the income statement, our net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $45 million, versus $41 million for the same period in 2015. For 2016, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $95 million, up from 2015 due to lower cash balances resulting from our capital deployment activities, which I'll cover in just a minute. We continue to expect free cash flow this year to look similar to 2015, though more weighted to the latter part of the year. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a cash balance of $1.9 billion, and a net debt position of $1.5 billion, both essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we had $500 million of fixed rate notes mature, and we're in the process of refinancing that debt as we speak. We intend to replace that debt and raise an additional $500 million from general corporate purposes to include share repurchases. Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the quarter. This was lower than our original expectation as we adopted a new accounting standard that altered the accounting for tax benefits associated with our stock options and restricted stock. In a nutshell, these tax benefits are now treated as a permanent benefit that impact our effective tax rate. In the second quarter, this change reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 140 basis points. We're at a rate of 28.8% year-to-date, and we're now targeting a full-year rate right around 29%. On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter we repurchased 1.1 million shares, bringing us to just under 9 million shares in the first half of 2016 for almost $1.2 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first six months of the year, we spent $1.6 billion in shareholder-friendly capital deployment, more than two times our free cash flow for the first half. Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Candice, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Absolutely. And our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, David.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, Phebe. Thanks for taking my question. Phebe, thanks for all the color on Gulfstream, but maybe just a little bit more color on the large cabin market, and how you saw it evolve in Q2, both from a used inventory perspective, how you're competing on the G450 and G550 with the used inventory that's out there, and the G650, and then what you saw regionally? Did North America hold in there pretty well? Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So I think I gave you a pretty robust response in my remarks, but let me parse this, our market, in a couple of ways. First, let's talk about the G650 pre-owned market. So I've seen some folks saying there are going to be 20, or there are 21 used airplanes in the market. We simply do not see them. If I count serial numbers, we have 14 on the market right now with one pending transaction. We have 186 in service, so that equates to 7.5% of the fleet. That is well below the 10% used to in-service ratio. So that's rather typical. And by the way, we have long anticipated the emergence of a G650 used market, so in my mind, this should be no surprise. I would also note that we have seen minimal impact with a few customers choosing the near-term availability rather than wait. So from my perspective, based on the facts and the data, we're quite comfortable that that used market is appropriate and acting in a rational and typical sort of way. So G650, so if you talk about by model, the G650 demand remains quite active. In our subs market, sub-sections of the market, the G450 and G550 are, as we anticipated during this period of transition to the G500 and G600, complicated the touch by competitors' overproduction. By the way, I might tell you that the G500 and G600, a lot of those positions are sold in 2016 and 2017. So we like how all of that is shaping up. And with respect to the geographic distribution, about 50% of the orders were North America, and I think the rest split between Mid-East, Asia-Pacific, Europe and South America, in that order. Okay?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. I wanted to switch to Marine for a moment, Phebe. You guided for us earlier, but you have a lot going on there. You've got the Block IV pricing going up, there's growth in ORP (20:33) funding. When would we start to see some real improvement in sales from all of these positives?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we've been experiencing that improvement, but when we look at the Navy's plan to continue with the Gulfstream, or the Virginia-class deliveries, as well as other (21:00) replacement, we see that we get some real nice ignition starting in 2019, when we have long-lead delivery – how we're anticipating, based on the Navy's plan, long-lead delivery in 2019. But let's not forget, this has been a very nice, steady quarter-over-quarter performer.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): True. And how would the TAO(X) factor in, and does that impact NASSCO's margins later this year, next year, the win there?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So the TAO(X), let's remember that our award was for one ship, and multiple, I think with five options, subject to the request, authorization and appropriation. So those oilers are right in our wheelhouse, and we ought to be able to perform very nicely on those. And it positions us well for the 17 ships in the Navy contract. It was an unusual award, but it has – there were no surprises, and I think, from (22:06) was an unusual contracting process, but from my point of view, there were no surprises, because sort of lined up with, who does what well.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Phebe, you talked a lot about the earnings and the revenue for the year. In the past, you've talked about free cash flow conversion relative to last year. So now with a higher net income, should we still see a similar conversion? And somewhat related, we knew you were going to be eating into those international combat advances, but really, what should that advances line look like when we get to the end of the year on the balance sheet?
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sam, so as I addressed in my remarks, we do continue to see full year free cash flow for this year looking similar to what we had last year, although as I said, a little bit inverted toward the second half of the year, slightly different profile than we had last year from a timing standpoint. As it relates to the advances, we'll continue to draw down on those, so you'll see that balance – you've seen it come down throughout the first half of the year, and we'll see that continue, as we continue to make progress on the production side of those contracts through the balance of the year.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: But coming down at the same rate?
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I don't have the exact specifics on that. We can perhaps talk after the call on that. But directionally, yeah, we'll see it continue to come down.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Doug.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I wanted to try and understand a little bit of the margin situation at Gulfstream. I mean, the margins have been great, at around 20% level, even with declining production. So, can you talk a little bit about what's enabled you to achieve that as you're going through a transition to the new programs? You have a lower rate on the G450 and G550. And when you roll that forward, do you expect, if you have to take rate down perhaps even more on the G450 and G550, can you keep that margin level through the product transition?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, let's talk about this year, and I don't want to get into too much specificity in 2017 and 2018. But the margins are driven by – and this is true year in and year out – they're driven by our managing of costs and our cost reduction, in addition to the G650's nice contribution. So when I think about that, that and our performance on service has been quite nice through the course of the year. So I have a great deal of confidence that we can continue to maintain our profitability as we go through. We'll have to modify it somewhat, but with our profitability, going through this transition period.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And that is – but even as you take rates down and you, in theory, would lose some operating leverage.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we've pretty much planned in the rates on the G450. I don't see any more reductions. In fact, I don't see any more reduction on the G450. And the G550, we see very minimal changes going forward. So looks, our job is to keep earnings up as high as possible during this transition period, and manage our margins. We're going to continue to do that. I think we've demonstrated that track record the last six quarters, and we're going to continue going forward.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much. First, Phebe, I have a clarification.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Howard.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thank you. Sorry. I think you said G500, G600 sold in 2016 and 2017. Did you mean that you're largely sold out in 2017 and 2018?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I'm sorry, if I wasn't clear on that. The G650 is sold out in its entirety through the first quarter or through 2016, and also in its entirety through 2017. So when we look at the order activity on the G500 and G600, what I'm saying is, is that our expectations for entry into service would remain the same. In that projection, we have sold an awful lot of our both of those G500s and G600s. So that positions us very well, I think.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: So I'm sorry, again, so 2017 and 2018 for the G500 and G600 are largely sold. Is that how I'm hearing this?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. We've got a lot of sales
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: And then just to follow this, it sounds like, though, there were some adjustments to the large cabin delivery schedule. Could you articulate where you are for this year? And I guess, you probably won't. And then maybe if you can address some elements of how you're thinking about 2017.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So I don't want to get into 2017 at the moment because, as you know, we provide that to you in the fourth quarter of the 2016 call by tradition. So that said, let me give you some color on where we are in the moment. First, production rates this year have not changed. So we've kept them the same as when we set this plan. Revenue is impacted in 2016 by a couple of factors; one, we have one less screen (28:12) airplane, I think it's the G280, and six fewer completions. We're moving these completions from this year into next, largely because of customer preferences on when they want to take the plane. And then we got a mix of other smaller puts and takes.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, Phebe. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow up on the G500 and the G600 really quickly. I think, at the launch event a few years ago you suggested that the book-to-bill, or the bookings that you take on that aircraft would be kind of barbelled. You take some at the beginning, would have a lull until you got closer to the entry into service of the aircraft. I'm wondering, if that's still the way that you're thinking about that. And at what point historically do you see the second into that barbell begin to pick up? Meaning when (29:16) we see some more orders for the G500 and G600 begin to come in relative to the entry into service? How much before entry into service do we see that to pick back up?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So I don't have perfect clarity about the precise timing of when orders will pick up, but it's our expectation building on the good sales we've had (29:39) that the closer these airplanes are to entry into service, our sales will pick up.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Phebe, can you comment on the capital deployment strategy and where your head is currently in terms of M&A? The market's gotten richer or cheaper in property, availability has gotten better or worse, and also the repurchase slowdown, is there anything to read there?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So on M&A, I really don't have any update for you, but if and when we do something, we'll let you know. We'll advise you. Jason, do you want to talk through the share repurchase?
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I think, Myles, for the balance, when you think about the year, our objectives, our targets for the year on deployment haven't changed. As you know, we were fairly on the active side in the first quarter of the year. And so we looked at the second quarter, and we feel like by the balance of the first half of the year we're right on track and doing exactly what we had hoped to do. We've deployed, as I said, two times our free cash flow on share repurchase and dividends. So I don't think you should see that as a signal of any directional shift for us at any time.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So the full year return on capital still targeted to be 100% of net income then?
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: That's correct.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, and nice quarter.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a clarification and a question. I know, Phebe, you said the production plan didn't change, but I just wondered if you could clarify whether or not your cost plan changed at all. I know you had some cost reduction actions and furloughs. I didn't know if any of that changed from what you initially planned on. And then one for Jason, just on the FX front, I mean, you've called out the UK impact. I think, you've got a little bit of Swiss impact as well. What should we be thinking of in terms of forward impacts, if currencies stay where they are? Are there any transactional FX exposures that we should be aware of going forward? Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So look, as I mentioned earlier, our margins at that level really aren't sustainable each and every quarter. But the G650 is contributing, and really it's cost management, cost reduction that's driving our margins. And so it's hard with perfect clarity to estimate the goodness that you can achieve until you're really in the moment. So we're continuing to manage our costs. I think we've got more way to go. And then at the same time, by the way, we've got to continue to improve the G650 and G280 operating margins, which we will do and are doing. And then we've got to ensure that the G400 and G500, or G450 and G500 maintain their profitability. And so I think that (33:05) very nice on track, particularly with respect to the latter.
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So Carter, with respect to your foreign exchange question, you can think about our exposure as this way, in order of magnitude, if you will. It's really Canadian dollars, euros, pounds, and then Swiss francs sort of, in terms of magnitude. But the updated guidance that Phebe walked you through earlier was actually predicated on the latest rates we have at hand projected through the balance of the year. So that is the latest look at the impact, and it's not – I wouldn't call it material through the balance of the year, but we also don't necessarily take a bet on rates moving further one way or another. So if there is a further movement in the second half, we would obviously tell you about that and it could have an upside or a downside impact to that guidance. The last thing I would say is that there's no, absolutely zero, from our perspective, transactional exposure. This is all strictly, as we've discussed before, the translation for U.S. dollar reporting. Everything from a transactional perspective is hedged in, and has been working effectively up to this point.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Ron.
Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. Hey. Good morning. Phebe, I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update where we stand on the Ohio-class program, in terms of what's going on actually at Electric Boat, and then what you're looking for over the next coming quarters.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So if you've been following this, the Navy and Electric Boat have been active in a number of discussions. Most recently we delivered our Ohio Replacement Integrated Product and Process Development plan, and think about that as the detailed design and long lead material portion of the procurement process. So the Navy is reviewing that in the moment. I think their plan is to get back to us sometime late summer, early fall. But that's kind of their call in terms of the cadence of the timing. But that will provide, and should provide, depending when we close on that, some upside in this year. And then again, as we've talked before, this is a very strong growth engine for us over time.
Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. So Phebe, how far are the G450 and G550 sold into next year? And I think, at one point you said you'd rather take down production than take down price. How large is that period between when that backlog ends and when we might see initial deliveries of the G500?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, I'm comfortable that we can manage this transition, and we are in good shape to either – we sold a fair number of the positions going into next year, particularly on the G450, and also on the G550. So the transition, the trick to the transition is, we've got to bring down the production on the G450, G550 while ramping up the production on the G500 and G600. The ease of this is somewhat benefited, or somewhat benefits, from the fact that these two sets of airplanes are built in completely different facilities. So, if you're suggesting that we have a gap, that's not an altogether bad thing, as long as we stay on schedule for our deliveries on the G500 and G600, which I see no reason why we can't at the moment, but we're in good shape for next year on the G450, G550. Got a little ways more to go, and then we'll set the production rate for the G500 and G600 as we move forward. So does that get to the essence of your question?
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much, and good morning. I was wondering if you could tell us, maybe Jason, of the shortfall in cash flow, free cash flow, relative to net income this year, maybe in kind of qualitative terms, how much of that is related to the construction of flight test articles for G500 and G600? And do all those flight test articles go to customers, and so do all of those costs go into inventory?
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So the flight test articles do go into inventory, and eventually they'll go into long-term product design use or to customers. I would say, from a qualitative standpoint, the outsized impact on the cash flow differential is really more about the international program advances being drawn down. There's some impact on, not so much the flight test aircraft impacting Gulfstream so much as just inventory build toward production, but that's the minor share. The larger share really is about the international advance drawdown.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi George.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Yes. Hi, Phebe. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: I wanted to pursue, you had four used sales in Gulfstream. Could you give us the revenues and approximate earnings? And I would assume that that would have deflated the margin you reported, as high as it was. So when you go to the second half and you have higher revenues, why does the margin be somewhat less than what it was this quarter? Thanks.
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So George, I'll take that. The revenues for the quarter were right around $40 million, I believe, is the number for pre-owned, and as is typical, it's right around breakeven, maybe a $1 million or $2 million loss associated with those, which is pretty typical. If I understand your question, for the balance of the year we do have profiled, as we've talked about before, an expectation of additional pre-owned coming into inventory and being sold, which actually is consistent with the point Phebe made before, with a little bit of a downtick in margins, particularly in the third quarter. So I think those are consistent, unless I misunderstood your question about the balance of the year.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: No. I think it's right, Jason. I just thought that, to deliver four used planes in subsequent quarters, you're probably not going to do that much, maybe you will. So I was kind of figuring the used planes would be less, so you got a little less pressure on the profit and you got higher revenues.
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Actually, a little bit more color on that, the planes in the quarter, there were four of them, but the mix of them, they were pretty modest in terms of revenue per unit. So that's not the assumption necessarily going forward. There are a lot of different mix in there, in terms of the inventory that we take in.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah (40:48). So think about it this way, George. We sold four in the quarter, which you know. We took in three and have sold one, so today we have two in inventory. But remember that the margin impact can vary depending on the aircraft itself.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay. No, that's a good answer. And one quick one, Combat margin is usually the biggest in the fourth quarter, and yet your guidance is implying that second half won't be as good as the first half. So if you had a little explanation on that.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So we are in the third quarter and more importantly, in the fourth quarter beginning to move from our – as the domestic land forces contract, some of those begin to taper down, we are increasing our international production. So we've got – that's really the margin pressure. It's simply a question of mix. As long as operating performance is good, these guys have done very well, but they've got to come down their learning curves, right?
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Right. Okay. Thanks very much. Very good.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Good morning. Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey. Phebe, can you give us any color on the customer mix or geography on all those mid cabins in the quarter that you sold? And was that order activity in line with your expectation on a dollar-based book-to-bill basis, or would you say you're slightly surprised with the upside? And sort of to that, can you talk about how wait times on the mids change in the quarter? Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So if I understand your question properly, our sales on the G280 were a little different, or a little better than we had anticipated. And I think that's just reflecting the strength of the North American market. So with respect to wait times, and let me give you this opportunity or take this opportunity to give you a little bit of color on the wait times, on the G650 and G650ER, we're about 24 months; G550 and G450, nine months to 12 months, no change; G280, nine months to 12 months; and the G150, we've got onesies and twosies left to sell there. So the first available there is a year from now.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thanks. So on the G280, better than expected, that wasn't just timing, that was actually just – maybe you just won a few more awards that could have gone either way.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think that, that's right. And it wasn't – that's always the case. We understand our customers' needs, but the order in which they want to execute the placement of their fleet will kind of depend on their imminent needs for the mission that a particular airplane serves. So the good news is, they're selling well, the G280s, but it does impact book-to-bill.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Sure. Thank you.
Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations: Candice, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Yeah, Phebe, I guess, I'll ask you one on the Navy subs program. I'm wondering how you think about – there seems to be some emerging chatter from the Democrats about the affordability of nuclear triad recapitalization. And I know you have some potential CapEx bills to pay as you think about what the rates are going to be. So how do you decide out of your CapEx profile there at Marine, given kind of the sizable bills the Navy is going to have to pay, and if they can pay those bills or not?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, there is often chatter when we – and this has been true from the last time that we recapitalized our nuclear fleet, about the affordability of it. But this is really a national policy issue, and to the extent that the United States wants to maintain a nuclear deterrent, they've got to build this submarine. So that's number one. And that's my view. And I think that that's supported by many people in the government on both the Executive and the Congressional side. So I wouldn't say that Democratic – some chatter in the system suggest walking away from this requirement. So I think in terms of – the Navy has budgeted here a revenue flow to us that we can easily accommodate the CapEx and the other improvements that we have going forward in terms of the ability to build these. I might also tell you that we've been spending CapEx over the last few years to position ourselves, particularly at the Quonset Point, on the Ohio replacement. So we work very carefully with our Navy customer to determine what they need, what we need, the funding allocation, who's responsible for what, and we're certainly not going to get caught long.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Do you think ultimately you keep the Virginia rate at two per year?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, that's the plan. In fact, we like that plan.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: I hear you. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the General Dynamics Q12016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operation Instructions] Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference may be recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Erin, please go ahead.
Erin Linnihan: As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filing. I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Erin. I will keep my remarks somewhat brief, since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward. I'll try to give you some of the more prosaic data up-front and then give you a little bit of color and insight from my perspective. The first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $2.34 per fully diluted share on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.7 billion. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion, and earnings from continuing operations of $730 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.18. We were also better than our previous guidance to you. The diluted weighted average share count was $312.3 million for the quarter, compared to consensus of about $315 million, which accounts for approximately $0.02 of the out-performance. I should note that at the same time a year ago, the diluted weighted share count was 22.4 million shares higher. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.9%, somewhat higher than anticipated. Therefore, almost all of the out-performance came from strong operating results, as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.6%. With respect to cash, we had $439 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of 65 million, we had $374 million of free cash flow from operations. The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would imagine, the strong operating performance. Compared to first quarter 2015, revenue was down $60 million, less than 1%. However, our operating earnings were up $26 million, or 2.5% over the prior year's quarter on a strange of a 40-basis point improvement in margins. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $85 million or 1.1%. but operating earnings were up $17 million on a 30-basis point improvement in margin. All of the foregoing is a reflection of positive operating leverage. Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 9.3% over the year ago quarter, as a result of better operation earnings and lower share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate. So let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of our operating segment. First, Aerospace. Sales were down $121 million, compared to Q1, 2015, about 5.7%, and down $155 million sequentially against a strong fourth quarter. Earnings were down against the year ago quarter by $20 million, only 4.6% on a 30 basis point expansion in operating margin. Operating earnings were up a million sequentially on 150 basis point improvement operating margin. Orders to the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders of 1.3 billion were 1.3 billion and the dollar book base book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we saw on the first quarter of 2012 through Q1 2015. The Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter over the last five years, including 2016, is $1.35 billion, a book-to-bill of 0.5. So it was a quarter were the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. And I should also note that activity has been strong in April. So we are off to a good start in Aerospace, generally consistent with our guidance to you. We had previously guided to a modest increase in revenue, a modest decline in margins, and flat operating earnings for the year. We still believe we will be at flat operating earnings for the year, but with slightly lower revenue and somewhat higher margins. As a result of increased efficiency, we have been able to slip a few deliveries in the next year and still come out in the same place. Let me turn to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.13 billion was up $188 million or 9.7% compared to the year ago quarter, and up $149 million or 7.5% sequentially. Operating earnings were up $4 million or 2.1% against the year ago quarter, and up $20 million or 11.6% sequentially. We had particularly good performance at Electric Boat. Also at Electric Boat, the Navy announced its acquisition strategy for the $100 billion Ohio replacement program which designates EB as the prime contractor responsible for about 80% of the construction of new subs. The Navy also articulated a build strategy for the Virginia attack boat program during the same timeframe, and we find that very wholesome. Some of the more interesting comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, sales were down $90 million or 6.6%, largely due to timing, but earnings were up $13 million or 6.4% on a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin. The 17% operating margin is second only to the third quarter of 2013, in all the group's history. Sequentially, revenue was down $251 and operating earnings were down only $17 million on 160 basis point improvement in margins. This is a business that always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries. So this comparison is really quite wholesome. Also in the quarter, we began to transition from engineering into low rate production on two large international orders for Canada, the mid-east, and the U.K. vehicle programs. These programs will continue to grow through the next several years. Even given Combat's large backlog, they had nice order activity in the quarter with a one-to-one book-to-bill, all in all, extremely strong operating performance at Combat Systems. With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good performance in the group. Revenue in the quarter was down $37 million or 1.6% against a year ago quarter, and up $172 million sequentially. Operating earnings of $248 million in the quarter were $31 million more than the year ago quarter, up 14.3% on 140 basis point improvement in margins. Once again, nice operating leverage. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $18 million, or 7.8%, and margins were consistent with last quarter. The trend here is clearly in the right direction. I think it's important to note that IS and T backlog was $851 million in the quarter and the book-to-bill was $1.3 for the quarter, following the strong book-to-bill of one-to-one on average for the last three years. The last time the book-to-bill was higher was in Q3 of 2008. This represents a very wholesome win rate for these fast cycle businesses. So we are off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice, and has been for many years, to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice is to say that we are ahead of the operating plan on which our guidance was based. We will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve performance. On a quarterly basis, we expect the second quarter to be weaker than the first in the nickel category. I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. About a year ago we started talking about the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the resulting impact that foreign exchange rates had on our reported results, especially within Combat Systems. Remember we're referring to the translation of our international results into U.S. dollars rather than any economic harm to our contracts. This continues to be a factor in 2016, and in the first quarter, assuming stable exchange rates from the year ago period, our revenues in the Combat segment would have declined by 2.3% versus the 6.6% decline we reported. And for the company as a whole, first quarter revenue would have actually been up slightly from last year. Moving on to a few other income statement matters. We took a charge of $13 million in discontinued operations to record the final resolution of some outstanding items related to a disposition that closed last year. We don't expect any further activity in this area during the year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $21 million in the first quarter of 2015. On the capital deployment front, we expended just over a billion dollars on the repurchase of 7.8 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $1.2 billion in shareholder friendly actions during the first quarter. That's more than three times our free cash flow from operations, and we used a little bit of that balance sheet cash to do so. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet remains strong and reflects a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion. As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 29.9% for the quarter. While that was slightly higher than our full year forecast, we're still on course for a mid-29% tax rate for the full year. Erin that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan: Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Liz [ph], could you remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason M. Gursky with Citi.
Jason Gursky: Hey. Good morning, Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning, Jason.
Jason Gursky: I was wondering if you could drive a little bit - good morning. I was wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper on the Aerospace business that you talked about, a revenue slip or a push out or maybe it was something that was driven on your own volition, but some sort of slip into next year on the revenue side. I'm wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper on that. And then also just talk about the sustainability of the margins that we saw this quarter. Obviously continued to see some expansion there. Just wondering whether these are any kind of one time kinds of things or whether we're setting a new bar here for margins? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So let me talk a little bit about revenue and give you some insight into how we think about revenue and how we develop it with respect to Aerospace. We take revenue directly from the operating plan, and revenue in Aerospace is driven by a multitude of factors, as you would imagine, given the complexity of the business. Airplane green and completed deliveries, service volume and mix, which by the way can and do move across reporting periods. Pre-owned Jet Aviation Services and completion. So some of these are harder to predict because they have more estimating methodology embedded. For example, I think it's a pretty good one. Our plan has us selling between 10 to 14 pre-owned airplanes with revenue of $250 million at break-even margins. It's very difficult to forecast this. This quarter had one sale for $4 million, a good thing, but below our revenue estimate. On the other hand, the easiest factor to predict is airplane greens and completion deliveries because of the backlog of the 650. We have some other models to sell for delivery in Q4 but do not see that as a problem. As I told you, we're striving to keep our earnings flat for the year, and that's what we think is feasible.
Jason Gursky: And are the sustainability of the margins going-forward?
Phebe Novakovic: We're sticking with, you know, we're going to have slightly higher margins, as I said, because we're going to keep our earnings flat, and we're going to have slightly less revenue. So I think the margin you're going to see, as I noted some improvement, from what I guided you to which was about 19%.
Jason Gursky: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.
Ronald Epstein: Hey. Good morning, Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Hey, Ron.
Ronald Epstein: So I think probably no big surprise, sort of the question that everybody's, you know, kind of thinking about is, what demand are you seeing on 650? How is that going? I mean, it's - I think it's no secret there's been some more 650's piling up in the available for sale market. Can you just give everybody your perspective on what's going on there? And how healthy that market is, or not. Just some color on that?
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. Be happy to. So what I want to do is give you some facts instead of speculation. Think about it as firsthand intelligence, not second and third hand conjecture. So let me parse this in some specificity. First, sales activity, as I noted, in the quarter is similar to the quarter of last year. Our first quarter earnings were in line with all of our other prior years. In other words, we typically come off a strong fourth quarter, and orders this quarter were as anticipated, seasonably light. The pipeline, however, remains nicely active. I would note that the U.S. stock market fluctuations in that first quarter seemed to slow down some purchasing decisions, but our pipeline remains active. Today, we have the same competitive pressures that we've been dealing with for the last year, including overproduction of large cabin planes by others. So think about it this way. No change on that front. Demand for the 550 and 450 is in line with our expectations, and we continue to see interest in those planes, particularly the 550. The 650 is sold out for the year, and the first available ELS is about 24 months out. Remember, I think it's important to recall, but the 650 has 100% market share for a market it created, and from my perspective would appear to, I think it's safe to assume, or what I see, is that it's likely to remain in that position for the foreseeable future. It's still a hot plane and our demand is solid. The number of pre-owned 650's apparently on the market is higher than in the past, but to the best of our knowledge, we have not lost a single sale to pre-owned aircraft. So I've tried to parse for you sort of how we see it from the battlefield. And give you the facts by - by the, you know, the large cabin airplanes that we sell.
Ronald Epstein: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Maybe just to follow-up on Ron's question may be slightly more broadly. What you're seeing out there on the Aerospace side in terms of regional variances, but I don't think has changed in the first quarter this year, and also more broadly, on the pricing of your product?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, orders in the first quarter were 50% U.S., 30% Mid-Eastern Europe and 21% Asia Pacific, that goes everywhere from, and our region there is from Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, into China. Frankly, not a whole lot of quarterly variance on the - where the orders are emanating from. Pricing, we have, as we noted, adjusted our prices for the 450, 550 commensurate with where they are in their life cycle. We have not, and do not, intend to adjust for 650 prices.
Robert Stallard: And any change on the G280 there?
Phebe Novakovic: No, it's about the same.
Robert Stallard: Okay. That's great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter J. Arment with Stern Agee CRT.
Peter Arment: This quarter. Phebe, could you give us an update on kind of where things are on the G500 and G600 program? I saw the announcement earlier this month on kind of the progress but, you know, kind of how you view those programs transitioning into 2017 and 2018? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. Both airplanes, the G500 and the G600 are moving nicely through their test program. There have been no negative surprises. And as I think you alluded to, you read that we recently joined the wing to the fuselage and on the G600 we expect to fly later this year or early 2017. From the sales perspective, the customer interest in both airplanes has been good and, you know, and as we progress through the development program, we expect the demand to increase. Bye the way, to - for those of you who like to speculate about Gulfstream future models. I wanted to assure you that there is no 600ER. We'll be able to publish a definitive range for that plane once we're in test flight, and we have a reputation for exceeding our target, but the G600 is the G600.
Erin Linnihan: I think we can take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Co.
Cai Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much. Good numbers, Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you.
Cai Rumohr: Could you comment on two things, you know, why was your profitability quite so good this quarter, and particularly where was R&D? And secondly, you mentioned a couple of deliveries slipping from this year into next year. How many slipped? And why did they slip? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: So, you know, profitability and you're focus on cost is a quarter-by-quarter battle. At Gulfstream, we had a couple of things. Favorable mix, improved labor efficiency, very nice high margins at service at Gulfstream, both from the mix of service in the barn and performance. We also had substantial improvement in G&A expense, even though R&D went up slightly. You know, we're benefiting from all of the cost cutting we've been doing. We've been improving our processes, reducing waste and we're also getting some benefit from lower material costs. So the cost initiatives began in 2015 to reduce overhead and indirect throughout the enterprise are paying off.
Cai Rumohr: And the slips in deliveries?
Phebe Novakovic: Yeah, so the slips in delivery. We, every year, every quarter, working with our customers, can determine whether it's more convenient or preferable to take one, two, three airplanes in a given quarter, in a given year. It's not unusual for us to move airplanes across reporting periods or across years even. So we typically haven't talked about it before, but I wanted to give you guys a little bit more understanding of a revenue number.
Cai Rumohr: Thank you
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel Pearlstein: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Sam.
Samuel Pearlstein: Just to ask something other than Gulfstream. Can you talk a little bit about the Ohio replacement? And I guess what I'm trying to just think about is when does that start to grow for you in terms of revenues? When do you start booking and so we see it in backlog? And really doesn't that have a negative margin mix as you transition work from Virginia class to Ohio replacement, and how should we think about that transition?
Phebe Novakovic: So let me talk to you with that. We have, over the last three years, been increasing our revenue and our performance on Ohio, all in the engineering and design portfolio side of our business. Those margins are all in the cost plus work tend to be less than mature in production construction on submarines, right? So you've seen that that quarter-over-quarter for the last several years, and that along with the two per year for Virginia has driven some of the growth. That will - from my perspective, the engineering and design work will be stable going forward, until it begins to transition down in the latter part of this decade. The - while we don't have specific time lines for when we're going to build the first ship, I think it's in the 2020, 2021 timeframe, but we're going to see some early, likely to see a taskless prologue. Some early material purchases so that we can, you know, we can lock in some favorable rates. So that program will program will really begin to ramp up really in the 2020's and go on for some time. The margin profile way out then is going to be driven in the first instance by how the contract is structured, and I don't know. We don't know yet, and I think the Navy, we're still working with the Navy on how they want to do that. Typically, in complex naval ship building programs, the first ship is cost plus, but that's the Navy's decision and we'll have a lot more clarity about the margin performance. But, again, it's past is prologue, Electric Boat has shown the proclivity and the ability to increase their profitability by reducing their cost and improving their manufacturing efficiency hull over hull. So this is a very important program for General Dynamics. Increasingly now, but very much in the future.
Samuel Pearlstein: And if I just looked at that past, do you typically do the long lead? Is it two years ahead of the boat construction starting? When do you start that long...?
Phebe Novakovic: I think it's about two years before.
Samuel Pearlstein: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Doug Harned: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Doug.
Doug Harned: Hi. I wanted to continue in Marine. The other big thing that is coming up is the competition for the TAO205, the LXR and the LHA8. And when you look at that, one would naturally see NASSCO as the choice for the TA205, Ingles is the logical choice for the other two ships. But how do you see NASSCO's position in competing for, particularly the LXR? Can you use the MLP hull form and be an effective competitor in that part of this competition?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, we've already submitted our bids and, you know, I'll get myself in a really sticky wicket if I spoke to the Navy about relative competency. But we know how to build the TAOX, no surprise, and we've bid appropriately on that entire solicitation. So I think that's about all that I'm permitted to say. Sorry about that.
Doug Harned: Okay.
Phebe Novakovic: Ask the Navy. See what they say.
Doug Harned: No, I understand.
Phebe Novakovic: I ask the Navy, so.
Doug Harned: Okay. And what do you see as sort of the timeframe now on how that's going to play out, that decision?
Phebe Novakovic: I'm told that it will be sometime this year.
Doug Harned: For the...
Phebe Novakovic: But I don't have any more clarity whether it's third or fourth quarter.
Doug Harned: Okay. Okay. That's great. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi.
David Strauss: A couple of questions on Gulfstream. I think your large cabin delivery guidance for 2016 was 104? Can you tell us what it is now, with some of the push out? Is the plan still to hold Gulfstream EBIT flat beyond 2016? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: I'm not going to give you the 2017 guidance. What I told you is, we're going to do 2016 at flat EBIT and that looks very, very possible from our perspective. I think we're moving one large cabin airplane from this year to next and a couple of mid cabins.
David Strauss: And Phebe, can you explain the large gap between green large-cabin deliveries in the quarter and completed? I don't think I've ever seen that large of a gap.
Phebe Novakovic: Oh, it's all timing, and it is the druthers of the customers on what they want in terms of outfitting them on their airplanes and any special configurations. There's nothing there that's particularly anomalous, simply timing.
David Strauss: All right. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi.
Robert Spingarn: Hi. So maybe we'll switch to IS&T for a minute; I wanted to ask you about two things there. Just on this big IDIQ on jitters for the handheld, three of you participating there, competing, so I wanted to ask you how you think about that in terms of orders for the contract, how that might impact IS&T sales and margins going forward? And then separately, this stretch of WIN-T and how that might affect things? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. So as it was reported in the press, we were down selected along with two others for what is essentially a 12.7 billion, five-year hunting license, and it- the way we're thinking about it in the moment is we deliver the next generation radio hardware in this quarter for evaluation and then full wave production follows that, conceivable this quarter and next. One thing that I think is interesting to note, is we've got the only radio that's a proven MUOS capable terminal. So that ought to, from another perspective, be a by the competitive advantage. You know, it's, with these IDIQ programs, you've got to sort of handicap what you see as your win rate. We typically have been very successful in our win rates, but again, it will be highly competitive and we're just going to have to work our way through it. This is a mission systems, where this resides is a high-operating leverage business, so I would expect them to perform nicely on those IDIQ contracts that they win. WIN-T is, you know, WIN-T has slipped more than a skater on the ice. We're in increment two; it's in full rate production. It's going to be fielded to the next, I think, to an active brigade combat team and National Guard units over the next eight, nine years. And it is already in the field and successfully supporting down range missions. So from a financial perspective, it's performing very nicely. It's sort of up to our customer on what the pace of deployments will be, but heretofore we've managed, because of our intimacy with the customer, we've managed to accommodate their desires nicely, and I would expect that to continue.
Robert Spingarn: So, Phebe, net-net, it sounds like the jitters is a positive relative to what you're thinking might have been when you initially provided 2016 guidance, and therefore, is it fair to assume that you'll bake that in with when we hear from you next on this?
Phebe Novakovic: Yeah. If, in fact, they start to issue the IDIQ purchase orders within this year. So that's part of what I don't know, right?
Robert Spingarn: Right. So it could be a 2017 thing?
Phebe Novakovic: It could be. But I don't know. So...
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning, Phebe, Jason. Phebe, I wondered if you could talk to the booking strength in IS&T and maybe even the margin strange in IS&T, sort of the difference between IT and Mission, give us some color on that, and maybe where some of that strength is coming from?
Phebe Novakovic: So let's talk about this in two parts. Our Mission system is still benefiting from the cost synergies we achieved by combining two of our businesses. They're also - and by the way, that's why I was interested in that combination. But the business unit guys were saying and oh, by the way, in addition to cost savings, we're going to see some marketing synergies. And I said, yeah, good, great. Well, it turns out they were right. So they have won more than their fair share, and that's reflected in no small measure in that $1.3 book-to-bill. And their performance, operating performance is really terrific. Now, this margin rate in the moment is a bit high going-forward. And while I'm not ready to update guidance, this group should be a double-digit earner in the near future. We've got additional opportunities for margin improvement in efficiencies and performance, and it - the margin performance in this group on the Mission Systems side is heavily driven by the product mix. On the IT side, again, this is a very competitive business, with terrific cash flow, and as I always like to tell everybody, great return on invested capital. They are very disciplined when they go into the market, and they win their fair share. And I say disciplined, we're careful that he we don't, you know, pursue contracts down rat holes where we don't think we can get a decent return.
Carter Copeland: And in terms of their pipeline, do you expect to continue to see win rates like this? And you know, obviously the market is, as you stated, pretty competitive, but clearly you've seen this trend for a while now.
Phebe Novakovic: So, you know, it is very difficult to project win rates in such a short cycle business. I've been pleased with how they've done. They can - they've got more performance opportunity, cost cutting opportunity, as they would quarter in, quarter out, and so, you know, a combination of performance and cost efficiency, dedication to schedule adherence to schedule, schedule is not a guideline, right? Those are the things that make you win, and these businesses are firing on all cylinders, so I'm pretty place pleased.
Carter Copeland: Great. Thanks for the color, Phebe.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jeffries.
Phebe Novakovic: Hey, Howard.
Howard Rubel: Good morning, Phebe. Thank you. To go to Combat Systems for a moment, I mean, you know, it's always lumpy when we see ads to the backlog, but keeping it stable at this point seems pretty good, given the large contracts you're working on. Could you address what you're seeing in terms of incremental interest internationally?
Phebe Novakovic: So as you and I have talked about on this call before, the world remains a dangerous place, and that Russian fair is roaring. So we've got considerable interests in interest in places that you might think. Just to give you a little bit of color on some of the contracts that we have just put into backlog, the Swiss Army is purchasing 4.4 combat vehicles, and that went in I think this quarter for about $400 million, U.S. dollars. So that was good. The Czech Republic is on the map, as is the Spanish 8 by 8 technology program, and our land systems is in good position on that - on that program. And then we continue to see demand signals coming out of the Mid East. Iraqi tanks, Kuwait and in other parts of the Mid East where there's some really hot wars going on. So you know the pipeline looks good internationally. And if you look at the Army budget, they're beginning to recapitalize, so that's pretty wholesome in and of itself. So, again, as in the IS&T case, our ability to perform with contract, keep our costs down will be the key to, again, winning more of our fair share. And oh, by the way, our armaments business is doing quite nicely as well.
Howard Rubel: That doesn't surprise me. Just sort of a little bit related to profitability, just to go to Marine for a second, the numbers were really good, could you address in some way how you were doing on Zumwalt and some of the other programs, just in terms of capability. Because, I mean, they seem to be surprising a little bit on the bottom line?
Phebe Novakovic: So let me give you some clarity on this program. Operationally, the ship is performing quite nicely; it's been out on two sea trials and we like what we see and, more importantly, our customer seems to. But let me remind everybody of a couple of things. First, we are not the integrator of prime on this ship, the Navy is. So I really don't have any insight into the program beyond our shipyard. I think that's the first thing to consider. The second thing is our share of the $22.4 billion program is less than about a quarter. So, again, that gives you some perspective. The Navy reported some cost growth to the Congress over the last 12 months and I don't have visibility into that number. I do know, what I do know, is that that VAS has experienced some cost growth primarily on the first of cost ship, which is the cost plus help. But that's not a surprise given the complexity of this ship. And we continue to work close closely with the Navy to ensure that, you know, we're delivering the ships that they want and that they need operationally and that, you know, we minimize or reduce risk, manage the risk from the second two ships. The 51 programs are running in tandem with 1000 and we've seen some impacts, as we started up a co-line, the 51s. And by the way, this flight of 51s is materially different and upgraded than the former flight. So we're confident that we can work through these, and we know these ships. So, again, we're working with the Navy on scheduling costs so that we can ensure we get them what they need with profitability that we require.
Howard Rubel: Thank you very much, Phebe. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning
Phebe Novakovic: Good Morning.
Seth Seifman: I'll ask the capital deployment question this morning and basically, obviously there's not really anything to quarrel with in a billion dollars of share repurchased in the quarter, but it's not the first time that you've bought back a billion dollars, and you know, given sort of the underlying objective of the repurchase program to be opportunistic, obviously you've had some opportunities in the first quarter, how do we think about share repurchases going forward and, you know, would you characterize what you did in the quarter as opportunistic?
Phebe Novakovic: Yeah. I mean, we believe that the stock was undervalued, so we went in and bought and we'll continue to do that in instances where we think the market has mispriced our stock. That's our view, and we've been consistent about that strategy. So I think that's not a particularly big change.
Seth Seifman: Right. And any color about the level of repurchases going forward?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, because we're opportunistic, you know, I'm going to have to see, you know, we understand in the absence of M&A, it's, and given the investments that is we're making in our gross businesses, I think it's a reasonable, shareholder friendly action to take, and, frankly, you know, never forget, it's all about the shareholders.
Seth Seifman: Yep. Absolutely. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Myles Walton: Can I ask a question on cash flow? And I know last year 1Q is a tougher comp and most of the advanced burn was in the second half of last year, but the improvement in conversion from herein out through the rest of the year, should we expect that to kind of pick up the pace and do you think conversion will actually be better than last year before you get to full conversion in 2017? You know, I think the way we think about that, and I think we signaled this before is that, you know, we the expect the free cash flow profile this year to look similar to last year. As you mentioned, it was a particularly tough comp from the first quarter of last year, which far outstripped our expectations and outstripped really a typical Q1 profile. The first quarter is usually a slightly softer cash performance and frankly, sometimes in the past it has even been negative. So on balance, I think you look at the year as similar to last year. It will fluctuate a little bit on the timing of some of the remaining progress payments and outflows on the international programs.
Myles Walton: Okay. And then, Phebe thinks for the color on the 650. But I'm curious, is there a level where you think the pre-owned stock becomes more of an obstacle to you selling aircraft or pricing, or maintaining the price?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, let me be clear. We're not going to drop the 650 price, or the 450, 550, based on the use. We don't compete that way. But let's talk about that used market. And it's not a homogeneous market. It's highly differentiated by model types. So let's think about it in two respects. You've got the 450, 550 used market that is mature, it's established, it has demonstrated factors that influence its behavior, and we have watched it now for well over a decade. The 650 is an immature developing market. So let me parse, if it would help a little bit, let me walk through both of those markets. So with respect to the 450, 550, we did lose some G550's to the used inventory because there were a lot of them, the late models, that were available, and there still are to some degree. But this is an active market, it's a very active market, and so it has pretty good throughput. I think in the last 12 months we sold - the market sold 29 used G550's. So this is a market with predictable and understandable transition rates and activity rates. And conversions. I hear less about the 450's used market, but I think the 450 is attractively priced. The bigger problem for those models, frankly, is that some customers are waiting for the G500 and G600. Now, the same has not been true to this point for the G650. I'm not aware of losing a single G650 new airplane ordered to a used airplane. I would also comment that, as I noted before, this pre-owned market is developing, it's a developing market. For example, it's not clear how many dedicated sellers we have. Some folks have been there in there for three years and not lowered the price. And there's not been a transaction there for some time. The early 650's, the early models, N numbers that were available to sellers or are available, are attractive at favorable prices, above the original sale price. Those were earlier on, but, you know, we've got to see how that market develops. By the way, we're very happy to help buyers in the used markets get into our airplanes. But one of these days, the market will be determined. But so far, it's just too speculative to observe outcomes.
Myles Walton: Okay. So you're comfortable with continuing to grow and pricing won't enter the discussion, but you're sold out for the next 24 months. So that's kind of the landscape as we see it right now?
Phebe Novakovic: Very wholesome.
Myles Walton: Okay. Thanks.
Erin Linnihan: And Liz, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolf Research.
Hunter Keay: Hi. Thanks for getting me on. I appreciate it.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Hunter Keay: Good morning. So Phebe, you talked about the difference in time between green deliveries and completions, and as it relates to customer preference. I'm wondering if that sort of implies maybe you shift away from fleet sales and more to sort of individual purposes. And maybe I'm just reading too much into it? And can you confirm that one way or the other? And can you also talk about, generally, how you think about margins versus fleet sales to the individual one off purchases? Thanks very much.
Phebe Novakovic: Okay. So I wouldn't read too much into the timing difference between green deliveries and completed. I mean, there's really nothing there. With respect to fleet and - and individual, let's talk about fleet. You know, fleet can be a fair number of aircraft going into a Corporation to replenish their, and refresh their active fleet. There's another series of fleet buyers that are fractional. We have very little exposure to fractional markets. And then there's another set of fleet buyers that buy for the Airlines. So that's a little bit different as well. And, again, we don't have too many of those. We are very careful on our pricing, very careful. So don't think about those as materially different. Obviously you get some volume discounts. But we have a pretty strict pricing discipline. Okay?
Hunter Keay: Got it. Thanks a lot for the time.
Phebe Novakovic: Great.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3583. Thanks, and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Dynamics Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Abigail, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Erin, and good morning, all. Earlier today we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operation of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we beat analyst consensus by $0.02, which is hard to do this late in the year. Revenue and operating earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by 6.6% and 2.9% respectively. Earnings from continuing operations, however, were up $27 million on the strength of a 50-basis-point improvement in operating margin and a lower tax rate. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.21, almost 10%. By the way, in connection with the comparisons to the year-ago quarter, let's remember that the fourth quarter 2014 was and remains the strongest revenue performance of any quarter in the last four years and by no small measure. So it is a very difficult comparison. And that will be true in the business segments as well. Sequentially, the quarters were very similar. Revenue was down $185 million or 2.3%, but operating earnings were up $2 million on a 40-basis-point improvement in margin rate. So all in all, a solid quarter with particularly good performance in the Aerospace group, which I'll speak about in a little bit more detail. So, for the year, where does that leave us? We had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.08 on revenue of $31.47 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.97 billion. Return on sales was 9.4%. Revenue for the year was up $617 million or 2%. Operating earnings were up $289 million or 7.4% on a 70-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations were up $292 million or 10.9% helped by a 200-basis-point improvement in the effective tax rate. This, together with share repurchases activity led quite naturally to a 16% improvement in earnings per share. So all in all, 2015 was a great year, improving significantly over a very good 2014. It was a year of further progress from an operating perspective and revenue growth consistent with our guidance to you at this time last year. Turning to cash. Free cash flow from operations was $120 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.93 billion, which is 65% of earnings from continuing operations. As we advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to reach 100% of net earnings for three reasons. First, we are working off the very large advanced payments received in 2014 on a major Combat Systems program. Second, we have an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream consistent with building numerous aircraft for test and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 program. And third, we were also working off large advanced payments received in 2014 at NASSCO for commercial shipbuilding programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively, but not until 2017. In 2016, we will continue to have less than our usual robust free cash flow. Let me give you some color on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace, revenue was down modestly over the year-ago quarter. Sales were down $98 million, but earnings were down just $2 million as a result of a 70-basis-point improvement in margin; very nice operating performance. For the year, revenue was $8.85 billion and operating earnings were $1.71 billion with an operating margin of 19.3%. This is a year-over-year improvement of 2.3% on sales, 5.9% on earnings, and 70 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and good order intake. During the quarter, we took down the production rate of the G550 to what will be the sustaining rate through 2016. The G450 will come down modestly in the first quarter of 2016. By the same token, the production rate of the G650 and G650ER were taken up during the second half of 2014 and will be taken up again in 2016 to reflect current demand and our sizable backlog. The production rate on the G650 and G650ER is clearly sustainable for this year and next. So, contrary to what many investors seem to have anticipated, order activity in the quarter was quite good. The book-to-bill at Gulfstream was at least one to one, both dollar base, one to one, and in units of green delivery, 1.1 to 1, with particularly strong demand for the G650 and G650ER. By the way, an interesting data point is that there were more orders for in-production aircraft in 2015 than 2014. All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good. Let me say a few words about the large-cabin business jet market in general. We find demand to be reasonable. We see no evidence at Gulfstream of a cyclical decline. The order activity is good, but not frenetic, and North America is particularly good. More than 50% of our orders for the year were from North America. I should also point out that, despite the hand-wringing by some, our orders from Asia Pacific improved by more than 60% over 2014. In short, this market is not ebullient, but it is steady from our perspective. We also seem to be picking up some share from other OEMs. Combat Systems. Combat revenue was down $90 million, or 5.6%, and earnings were down $37 million, or 13.7%, on a 140-basis-point reduction in operating margin over the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, a 15.4% operating margin was more than respectable and consistent with our expectations for the group. Sequentially, the story begins to foretell the future. Sales were up $179 million and earnings were up $16 million. That is 13.3% and 7.3%, respectively. For the full year, sales were down $92 million, or 1.6%, and earnings were up $20 million, or 2.3%, on a 60-basis-point improvement in operating margin. This margin expansion is the result of restructuring at both our European and Ordnance and Tactical Systems businesses. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. You may recall that we had guided to flat revenue and earnings. Overall, Combat Systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. By the way, in just a moment, Jason's going to give you a little bit more color on this group's revenue performance. This is a business poised for modest growth in 2016 and quite significant growth in the 2017 through 2019 timeframe as we begin delivering on our $19 billion backlog. Now, Marine Systems. The group's revenue of $1.98 billion in the quarter was down $58 million, or 2.8%, compared to the year-ago quarter, and down $105 million, or 5%, sequentially. Revenue for the year, however, was up $701 million, a rather extraordinary 9.6%. And recall that this increase in annual revenue follows a $600 million increase in 2014. Operating earnings were down $21 million, or 10.9%, against the year-ago quarter, and down $9 million, or 5%, sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $25 million, or 3.6%, despite a 50-basis-point decline in operating margin. In the Marine Group, we guided you at this time last year to revenue growth of 2% to 2.5%, which we exceed by a fair measure. We forecasted margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.1%. So the story here was better-than-anticipated revenue, but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively consistent with our guidance for operating earnings. The growth in revenue in the year was driven by Electric Boat on two Virginia-class construction, sub – two Virginia-class submarine construction and increased engineering work for the Ohio Replacement Program. This group's margins are the result of a mix shift; higher engineering work transitioning to Block IV from Block III and increased work on commercial Jones Act ships at NASSCO. IS&T is a business group where, once again, we saw less-than-expected revenue decline coupled with improved operating performance. Several of our major ground and maritime programs were all funded beyond our plan, improving our sales performance. Margin improvement was the result of greater efficiencies than planned in business unit consolidation and continuing operating performance across all the portfolio. Revenue in the quarter was $2.16 billion, down $307 million, or 12.4%, against the year-ago quarter, a very difficult comparator as I had mentioned previously. On the other hand, operating earnings of $230 million in the quarter were 8.5% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $11 million, or 5%, on the strength of 10.6% margins, 70 basis points better than last quarter. For the year, revenue was down $194 million or only 2.1%. Remember, this is dramatically less than the 5.5% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year. For the year, earnings were up $118 million or 15%; very good operating performance in the face of a 2% revenue decline. On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in this – in the 9% range, which we beat by 110 basis points. All-in-all, we beat forecasted revenue and operating margin. When that happens, the result is significant upside to the forecast. On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2015 was to expect revenue of $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.8%, a tax rate of 30.5%, and a return on sales of 8.7%. We wound up the year with revenue at $31.47 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3%, an effective tax rate of 27.7%, and a return on sales of 9.4%. Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10. We wound up at $9.08. About 46% of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.05 from the gain on the sale of a small business, $0.30 from a lower-than-planned tax rate, and the balance from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly a great year by any measure. So let me provide some thoughts about 2016, initially by group and then on a company-wide roll-up. In Aerospace we expect revenue to be approximately $8.9 billion, up very modestly. Margin rate should be down 10 basis points to 20 basis points and operating earnings flat to last year. 2017 should look a lot like 2016 with upside in revenue and earnings if we can deliver the G500 in the fourth quarter. Revenue and earnings growth will resume with full scale production and delivery of the G500 in 2018 (13:59) and the G600 the following year. In Combat, we expect revenue to be up $160 million and the margin rate similar to 2015 with more vigorous growth of both revenue and earnings in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The Marine group is expected to have revenue similar to 2015 but improved operating earnings as a result of operating margins in the mid-9% range. Revenue in 2017 and 2018 will have growth of a couple of hundred million a year, an additional $0.5 billion in 2019 growth. Finally in IS&T we expect a modest improvement in revenue and a 20 basis point to 30 basis point decline in operating margin that remind you again that a gain on the sale of a business was included in 2015's operated earnings and margin rate. This will result in essentially flat operating earnings year-over-year. Once again, we should see more solid revenue growth in 2017 and 2018. All of this rolls up to $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion of revenue, operating margin of around 13.3%, and return on sales of roughly 9.1%. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 29.5% tax rate, and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercise. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of around $9.20 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 at the same time on the same basis. Let me also reconcile this forecast of $9.20 to our 2015 year-end result at $9.08. In 2016 we will not have the operating gain from the sale of a business. That gain was $0.05 of EPS. In 2016, we will have higher interest expense with a $0.02 negative impact to 2016 EPS. We will also have a higher effective tax rate in 2016 that will cost us $0.23 per share. Foreign exchange headwinds at current FX rates will cost another $0.04 of EPS compared to 2015. On a pro forma basis, this suggests 2015 to $8.74 and gives us a 5% adjusted growth in forecasted 2016 EPS before deployment of capital. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it looks like most years. So divide our guidance by four, then take $0.20 off of Q1, $0.10 off Q2, leave Q3 even, and about $0.30 up in Q4. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of capital deployment. With respect to the deployment of capital, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2016 for dividends and share repurchase. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective for the reasons I have previously described, we will use balance sheet cash to some degree to supplement our free cash flow for share repurchase activity. I'll have more to say on this subject at the end of the first quarter as our planning becomes more refined and is approved by our board. I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our Combat Systems group given their increasing international activity. As Phebe pointed out, the group's full-year revenue was down 1.6% compared to 2014. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and to the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have actually increased by 6.4% in 2015. For the company as a whole this would have taken our 2% top line growth over 2014 to almost 4%. As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. This is merely the translation of our various international indigenous businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes, and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening dollar. Given where we see the mix of Combat Systems programs in the years ahead, we expect foreign currency fluctuations to be an ongoing part of the group's story. Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million, consist with the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, interest expense was $83 million, $3 million less than the year before due to the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that occurred in 2015. For 2016 we expect net interest expense of around $95 million. And the increase is due primarily to less interest income as we've deployed cash off the balance sheet. As we've deployed that cash over the year, we've moved from a net cash position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $1 billion at the end of 2014 to a net debt position of $614 million. And I'll walk through those capital deployment activities in just a minute. Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the year, right in the ballpark, slightly lower than the 28% we forecasted at the end of the third quarter. The lower outcome is attributable to favorable contract closeouts with the IRS and Congress' enactment of tax extenders in late December; in particular, the research and experimentation credit. For the year, the research tax credit extension benefited our rate by about 50 basis points, but was offset by some one-time unfavorable effects of other provisions in the extenders law. The combined effect was a 20-basis-point reduction in the 2015 effective rate, or about $0.02 per share. You may recall at this time last year that, given our increasing international presence, we considered the new normal for our effective tax rate to be in the 30% to 30.5% range. For 2016 with the research tax credit now permanent, we expect an effective tax rate in the mid-29% range. Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed about $185 million to our pension plans in 2015, as forecast. And for 2016, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. And finally on the capital deployment front, to summarize our activities for the year, we spent approximately $3.2 billion on share repurchases; and when you combine those share repurchases with our dividend payments, we used $4.1 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2015 or 2.1 times our free cash flow from operations for the year. Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Abigail, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT: Yes. Good afternoon, Phebe and Jason.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon.
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good afternoon.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT: Phebe, maybe this is a good opportunity just since we haven't spoke since the budget deal, and maybe you could just give us your overview how you see that impacting domestically? And also, related to that, are you seeing any changes on the international order front just given what has happened with the oil prices with any of your customers? Thanks, Phebe.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So the budget deal provided us funding in line with – exactly in line with what we anticipated, so no surprises there; and some upside, frankly, in a couple of areas. But that stability is critical and, I think, very helpful as we think through the defense portfolio for the next year or two. So that was, I think, very helpful. But as I said, it was consistent with what we had anticipated. With respect to international orders, we have continued to increase – and particularly on the Combat Systems side, increase our order activity internationally. And so far, we have yet to see any impact from oil prices in the Mid-East. You know, as we've talked a lot in the past, from my perspective, defense spending is completely determined by the threat. And the threat environment in that world has gotten nothing but worse. So we're very sensitive to our customers' needs and requirements. And we work carefully with them to ensure that we can provide them what they need when they want it and terms that are favorable to us and which they can accommodate. I would also remind you, by the way, that most of our orders in that part of the world are government to government, which provides some stability. So that is a benefit to us as well as we look forward.
Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. You had talked a little bit about free cash flow not being that robust this year. And you had talked about last – I guess, in 2015 because of the Aerospace investments. Can you just walk through what kind of expectations and then what changes as you go into 2017 that makes it start to see us return to 100% conversion?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's all three. It's a reversal, an unwinding of all three of the factors that we've talked about impacting 2015 and 2016, but let's take Gulfstream. We're continuing to build demonstration and test aircraft, test aircraft for both the G500 and G600. Our capital deployment – or our CapEx is largely done at Gulfstream, but that buildup in inventory will continue until we begin to take – or deliver the G500 and G600. So that will help unwind that buildup of working capital at Gulfstream. NASSCO will have completed its Jones Act ships in 2017. And then we anticipate a number of orders coming into the Marine group that, of course, carry cash. And in Combat Systems, we will begin to get additional cash as we ramp up to full-rate production on a number of our international orders. So 2015, 2016, lighter than we're used to. But 2017, it'll be above; every expectation we have is it'll be above 100% of net income.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Any way to quantify what percentage of net income you're expecting this year?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: It'd be about similar to last year.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Think about cash similar to last year.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Phebe, on Gulfstream, can you just talk about what you're expecting actually for the actual number of large cabin deliveries you're expecting in 2016? And then can you talk about what the reducing rate on the G450 and G550, what that's done to shrink or to expand the lead time? Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So let me take those in inverse order. We've been reducing the G450 very immaterially for the last about seven or eight quarters, so in line again with what we saw in demand and what we predicted in demand. And as to be expected, we reduced the G550 production rate in the fourth quarter, again, in line with demand. Our wait times are essentially the same, three to fourth quarters in those lines of business. In 2016, you asked about what are our production and delivery – what are our delivery targets in our plan. Large cabin about 104, medium cabin 34. That compares to 2015, large cabin of 112 and medium cabin of about – mid cabin about 35. So down eight large and one medium cabin, with a better mix, I might add. And that's what you would expect, a better mix as we enter this year of transition, more G650s, fewer G450s and G550s.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, Phebe, Jason. I wanted to ask for just a follow-on to David's question just on the pricing environment. Then I had a more technical question on your share authorization. Last year you did this twice and you had one in December and mentioned there might be something coming at the end of Q1. Is twice the norm going forward?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Let me talk about the pricing environment. We have held our prices very consistently, and to the extent that others are having pricing pressure, it hasn't affected us materially. So I think that's the full and short answer to that question. Jason, you want to...
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: ... share repurchases.
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, the share repurchase authorization, so you're right. We did a total of $20 million authorized last year in two tranches. We got $10 million authorized late in the year by the board. Certainly wouldn't want to get out ahead of them in terms of the plans for the coming year but we'll address that as it comes. And as the opportunistic approach to share repurchase works down that current authorization, we'll see where it goes midway through the year.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): But there's no mechanical plan here that continues like this? There's nothing to it? It's just coincidental?
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Exactly. It's coincidental. And as we said, as always, more of an opportunistic approach and we'll see where that takes us.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, George.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Phebe, the usual question I'll ask would go through. You had much better Gulfstream margin in the fourth quarter than the third even though the revenues were down. Maybe if you could explain a little more what happened there. And then going forward with G650s being up, I would think they probably have the highest margin at this point. So why would the margin deteriorate a little bit in 2016? Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So let me talk about revenue. As we noted before, we reduced the G550 rate for the fourth quarter. We had less preowned revenue than anticipated and somewhat less than anticipated service revenue. But Gulfstream was up and their backlog was up. Jet was down 5% in revenue and that was mix driven as we increased our engineering work in anticipation of the production work that we're starting this year. And we had lower FBO revenue because of fuel prices. We also had reduced business jet completions in St. Louis. So that sort of ties the bow on revenue. In margins, it's the same old stuff we always get, right?
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Right.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: From the usual suspects. We had mix shift. We had liquidated damages, launch assistant. And by the way, you quite rightly point out we had improved margins in the G650. So we anticipate roughly comparable margins. Those aren't what we (30:57) leading you to, guiding you to is – are not sufficient or significant material degradations in the margin rate. But what we are focused on and have been laser focused on and have been telling our investors for some time, we are going to keep earnings flat. And that's what we've signed up for and we see the path forward to clearly do that.
Operator: Thank you.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. On IS&T, Phebe, about a year ago or so, I think you were – you sounded pleasantly surprised at how well IS&T was holding up, and it has held up quite well while others in some similar businesses have had a lot of issues. The backlog's down a little bit in this quarter. If you look inside that business and look forward and you separate into Mission Systems and GDIT, how do you see those two outlooks going now over the next couple years?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Let me talk a little bit about the book-to-bill. With the exception of the fourth quarters in 2014 and 2015, our IS&T book-to-bill has been approximately one to one every other quarter in both years. Q4 in those lines of businesses tends to be more of an issue, a timing issue than anything else. And we expect book-to-bill for 2016 about one to one. These are businesses that are performing extremely well and winning more than their fair share based on their ability to increase their operating leverage by decreasing costs, and their performance has been outstanding. So it's more of the same for them going forward. So ruthless dedication to cost cutting, operating performance, must perform on that backlog. And that then quite nicely leads to the kinds of book-to-bill that we've seen in these businesses. So I see that as more goodness to come.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Do you see Mission Systems and GDIT behaving somewhat differently? They have somewhat different drivers.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, they're different margin businesses. Mission Systems tends to be more heavily product oriented in nature, and product tends to carry higher margins. Our IT business is services; services have lower margins. But as I like to tell everybody, they got great cash performance. In fact, by the way, both of those businesses have a great cash performance. And with our services business, terrific return on invested capital. So there's no invested capital. But think about our information – our IT services businesses. When they go to market, they go to market in their core, and they are very competitive in their core both through past performance and cost competitiveness. So I like where they're positioned, and that hasn't changed for us. They continue to win and they're a big dog in the barnyard, not to make too many metaphors.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, or I guess good afternoon now. I wanted to follow up on Gulfstream for a second, and on the G650 in particular. Could you comment on where this skyline currently reaches to? And also a little bit on the pre-owned or, I guess, the available for sale G650s that are in the market and at what point do you see that as being more of a threat to production, because there's always going to be a battle of if the like-new starts to approach price points of your aircraft coming off the line? Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Let me answer that in the inverse order. We have seen and don't anticipate seeing any impact from the planes that are in the used market. It really hasn't impacted us at all, because the guidance of the demand for that airplane has been, and we believe will continue to be, very, very wholesome. Despite taking up our production rates slightly, we are still at first quarter 2018 first available. So that tells you that is a strong, sustainable backlog for a very powerful airplane.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much. I want to turn to Marine for a moment, Phebe. There's a number of dynamics going on there. You have a new agreement at Bath. You've got a couple of new opportunities. And then, at the same time, you've been working through the Jones Act backlog. Could you describe a little bit of the working parts there and what might the Navy also do in terms of service going forward?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, yeah, let me talk about all three of those businesses and give you a little bit of color. We have achieved a very significant agreement with our partners, our workforce in Maine at Bath that will allow Bath to be increasingly competitive going forward in all of its competitions. And we're very proud of our workforce there, and we are very optimistic about our ability to compete on a going-forward basis. So I like what I see at Bath. And by the way, you didn't ask, but on the DDG-1000, the first one is 98% done; so almost out the door. The second one's 84% done; and again, with the kinds of issues that you might expect on the first-of-class ships, but nothing that has been particularly surprising to us. The third ship, I think, is only about 40% done, but it has a deck house that we entirely designed and built, so that reduces the risk going forward. So I see the future for Bath very nice. At NASSCO, we are continuing to work off the backlog of Jones Act ships, as you quite rightly point out. There is, we believe, significant demand going forward because of the age of the fleet that has to be replaced for more Jones Act ships. Our experience in the Jones Act market is it's highly lumpy, but there is demand out there. And because of NASSCO's performance and because of its good cost structure, they have been very competitive in their Jones Act competitions and won a nice backlog; and we continue to believe we're going to add to that backlog. Their service business has been performing very, very nicely. The Navy is, what we believe, quite rightly moving to fixed price service contracts, and we know how to work those and we've been working closely with our Navy customers. So we like what we see in service, particularly out west in San Diego; little bit of lightness in the Norfolk area as the Navy re-jiggers some of its porting of some major ships, but we anticipate service to grow reasonably well on the surface ship side, single digit, low-single digit with a nice operating performance. We also anticipate additional submarine service at Electric Boat. Nothing too significant, but, again, right in our sweet spot. And, again, at Electric Boat, it's a story about Virginia and Ohio. Right?
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Yes.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: But I (39:10) think a once over of that entire portfolio.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much for the rundown.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, Phebe, Jason.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hi.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I didn't know – just a quick clarification and a question. I didn't know if you mentioned the year-over-year impact from pension in that apples-to-apples comparison. If you could give us that, that'd be helpful as well. And then, just really appreciated the commentary on 2017, 2018, 2019. If you look – I know you talked about revenues in Marine and IS&T. And as you think about margins there, obviously, you talked about margins being up as part of the vigorous earnings growth in Combat. But when you look at potential for margins in the defense businesses in aggregate, and mainly IS&T and Marine, what's the outlook for those similar to the comments you made for Combat?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Let me have Jason ask the first part of your question on pension.
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. And Carter, if I understand your question, you're talking about the sort of the walk forward on EPS from 2015 to 2016. And really when you think about our pension plans and our accounting for those plans, especially in the defense businesses, that is a muted effect in EPS. So it really just isolated to the commercial pension side which had a negligible effect.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yep.
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I haven't calculated it, but it's nothing that would be materially...
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Extremely modest positive is what you're saying?
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: There you go.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So let's talk about the businesses. On a going-forward basis, we anticipate the IS&T group to be at around a 10% margin business. That may vary from quarter to quarter, or year to year depending on how much revenue the service business brings in. But for our foreseeable future that's about a 10% business. Combat, we see in the mid-15%, 15.5% pretty steady eddy. We may have, and we do, I believe, have margin expansion opportunity at the platform businesses. But remember, that will be somewhat offset by the short cycle business of OTS which we had terrific margins out of that business after we consolidated two units in 2014. With all things at defense, some of that goodness needs to go back to our customer, quite appropriately so. So that'll cause some margin compression for them. But from right now what we're planning for, for Combat, steady state 15%, 15.5% margin. We will, of course, strive for higher. And then the Marine group will be a 9.5% to 10% margin business depending on mix. As we've talked about before, performance at shipyards is, well performing shipyards, is all about the mix and we've got a number of mix shift issues which we've kind of articulated. But I think that gives you a sense of how we see our business going forward.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Phebe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, Phebe, thanks so much, and good performance.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: So at Gulfstream I guess two issues. One is if you could give us any help in terms of where the R&D and launch aid is in your plan for 2016? And secondly I guess more importantly, you had a 7% layoff you announced in December. Maybe walk us through if there's any severance impact in the fourth quarter and the types of benefits you expect to realize from that in 2016.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Let me talk a little bit about the reduction, then I'll turn it over to Jason. We've been talking for the last year or so about this transition period from moving from the G450, G550 to G500 and G600. Well, we're in it now, and quite appropriately you would expect us to size for that. So our head count reductions were all about sizing appropriately for what we see in terms of revenue and our promise to keep margins, well, keep earnings flat year-over-year. So we did some pruning. Headcount reductions were just a part of our cost cutting effort as we improved our operating performance, took a fair amount of overhead out and touch labor. And we'll continue to do so, on a going-forward basis.
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So on the R&D question, as you can imagine, the pace of that will sort of follow the cadence of the flight test program. So we expect that to pick up modestly in the next year and a little bit more in 2017 as we continue through that program. But I say modestly immaterially, still well within the range of our normal collar that we would normally expect R&D to flow in. Your question around the launch of systems payments, they'll continue to flow. I don't have the exact schedule of that, but it'll cause that quarterly amount to be lumpy as it's always been. And we'll report that to you when it gets out of line. But expect, net-net, a modest immaterial growth in R&D next year and then again the following year.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hello. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Just totally changing gears to the balance sheet. As you well know, right, the balance sheet's extraordinarily strong. Do you have any thoughts on maybe levering it up a little bit? Or what you think about that? Or what do you think the proper capital structure is for General Dynamics?
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So I think consistent with the position we've held in the past is levering up really is not something we're interested in, particularly as it relates to our current capital deployment approach of share repurchase and dividends. Incurring debt for the proper long-term strategic opportunity is certainly out there, but that's something that we'll continue to hold as dry powder until that type of opportunity shows up.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Yeah. Thank you.
Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations: And, Abigail, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much. To follow up actually from what Ron was asking, does this imply that the acquisition pipeline out there is not particularly attractive in your point of view? And maybe in relation to this, there's a little bit of stickiness going on in fed IT at the moment. Do you think this has any implications for you?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So fed IT, I think what you're seeing is – what we anticipate is seeing the same players just with new t-shirts on, new brands. In the pipeline, it is what it has been. And I think to Jason's point, it has always been our view that if we found something attractive and very accretive, we would lever up for it. But we haven't been there, and we don't see that as we stand in the moment. I don't think anything has fundamentally changed in the broader portfolio, defense and Aerospace portfolio. Service, a little bit, but that's – I gave you my view of that.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks, Phebe.
Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations: Great. Well, thank you for joining our call today. If you have any additional questions, Erin can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Dynamics' Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Nicole, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. As is obvious from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.28 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.99 billion and income from continuing operations of $733 million. This is $0.23 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 per share better than consensus. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $243 million, or 3.1%; operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.5% increase; and income from continuing operations is up $39 million, a 5.6% increase. This quarter's operating earnings of $1.034 billion reflects 12.9% operating margin, consistent with the 12.9% operating margin of third quarter 2014. By the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we have had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion. Sequentially, revenue is up $112 million, or 1.4%, operating earnings are down $47 million, and operating margin is down 80 basis points. Recall, however, that last quarter's earnings included a gain on the sale of our Cyber commercial security business. Excluding that gain, the operating earnings for the quarter are rather similar. On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $1.17 billion, a 5.2% increase. Operating earnings are up $320 million, a very strong 11.3% increase. And operating margins are up 80 basis points, once again, reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations. With respect to cash, we had $652 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter; that is 89% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.81 billion year-to-date, 82% of net income from continuing operations. You may recall that we received significant advance payments on international orders last year and on commercial shipbuilding orders the year before. That cash is being deployed this year and next as we have previously advised you. We are also hampered by OWC growth at Gulfstream, which is the natural result of building test articles in pre-production buildup of parts and wings for the G500 and G600. All of the foregoing makes performance at 100% of net income this year and next problematic. In the quarter, we repurchased 7.15 million shares for over $1 billion. We have purchased approximately 19.3 million shares year-to-date for about $2.7 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance to you that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts in excess of this year's free cash flow. To help you size that, we have spent $3.380 billion on share repurchases and dividends year-to-date compared to free cash flow of $1.81 billion. That is a delta of $1.57 billion. That delta is likely to grow in the fourth quarter. As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was a good intake of orders in all segments other than the Marine group where we have received several multi-year orders in prior quarters. The Marine group has the largest backlog of all of our operating segments. We ended the quarter with total backlog for the company of $68.7 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter. Let me say a few words about each of our businesses, business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue, earnings and margin are all up from the year-ago quarter, as well as for the first nine months of the year. The group reported sales of $2.34 billion, up from the third quarter of 2014 by $54 million, or 2.4%. This represents the group's highest-ever revenue quarter. Operating earnings increased $15 million, or 3.6%, to $426 million on an operating margin of 18.2%, a 20-basis point improvement on the year-ago quarter. By the way, this is the fifth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million. On a sequential basis, the group experienced some margin compression from the first half, but was nevertheless better than our expectations in guidance to you. We had good order intake in the group at 0.8 to 1 book-to-bill measured in dollar value of orders and 0.9 to 1 in number of units sold. The distribution of the orders is also attractive with the G650 and G650ER leading the way. Only four of the orders were for models not yet in production. Much like the automobile industry, general business aviation market is increasingly North America-focused with particularly strong interest from Fortune 500 companies. However, the G650 continues to see activity even in areas experiencing political or economic challenges. We had G650 orders from China, Japan, Brazil and Eastern Europe in the quarter. Our pipeline of projects and active sales discussions are good, so we are reasonably optimistic about order intake for the fourth quarter. Next Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter, with revenue of $1.35 billion, operating earnings of $218 million, and a really strong 16.2% operating margin. However, margins are off somewhat against the third quarter 2014, when we enjoyed an operating margin that was 40 basis points higher. Compared to third quarter 2014, revenue was off $50 million and earnings were off $14 million. Importantly, however, year-to-date revenue was flat against 2014; operating earnings are up $57 million, or 9.6%; and operating margin is at 15.7%, up 130 basis points. Combat Systems remains on course for a very strong year. The Marine group's revenue is higher than 2014, both for the third quarter and for the first nine months. Revenue in the quarter is up by $267 million, a 14.7% increase to $2.09 billion. Year-to-date revenue has increased by $759 million, or 14.4%, to over $6 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the group's submarine programs, both construction, repair and engineering, and to a lesser degree, commercial ship construction activity. This is the strongest revenue quarter ever for the Marine group. Operating earnings at $181 million are up modestly compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis points in the quarter and 50 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift and a one-time charge at NASSCO on a warranty item in the quarter. However, margins for the first nine months of the year remain a respectable 9.2% and should improve a bit in the fourth quarter. And finally IS&T. They continue to outperform our revenue expectations. Revenue of $2.2 billion is off $28 million against last year's quarter, but up $113 million, or 1.7% year-to-date. Recall that we had initially expected a 5.5% revenue decline for the year, and instead, we are up almost 2%. Operating earnings of $219 million are up $17 million, or 8.4%, compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 90-basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $100 million, a 17.5% increase on 130-basis point improvement in operating margins. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margin higher than expected. So what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? Well stronger than expected operating results in the quarter, a lower than planned tax rate, and somewhat lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.20. Our guidance goes from a range of $8.70 to $8.80 to a range of $8.90 to $9. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for some more details.
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a couple of things to cover before we start the Q&A period. As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility this year than we have in the past. Still not material in the aggregate, but it's having a negative impact on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue was held steady over the first nine months compared with last year, but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group sales would have been up by 8% year-to-date. As Combat Systems shifts away from a heavy reliance on U.S. military sales to an increasing level of international activity, we'd expect foreign currency fluctuations to continue to be a part of the group's story. Moving onto interest expense, the net expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2014. The slight increase is due to lower interest income as we've deployed over $1 billion this year from the balance sheet towards share repurchases and dividend payments. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $85 million. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net debt position at just about break even, a total of $41 million debt in excess of cash. This compares to a net cash balance of about $660 million at the end of the second quarter. And that change, again, is due to the capital deployment activity in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the quarter, lower than we expected as a result of increased international earnings as well as favorable contract closeouts and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, reflecting our favorable performance to date, we now expect an effective tax rate closer to 28%. We funded our pension plans as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2015 to be approximately $185 million. Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Nicole, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Yes. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, everyone.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jason.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Phebe, thanks for the additional detail and color in your opening remarks. It's very helpful. I just had one quick follow-up question though on some of the comments that you made around the book-to-bill. At Gulfstream, with regard to value versus units, it sounds like the number of units were a little bit better than the value. And then you followed on with some positive commentary about the G650. So wondering if you could dive in a little bit more about the difference between the two and what that might say about the pricing environment that you're seeing today for particularly the G450 and G550.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it was largely the difference between the two book-to-bill calculations is really about mix, and let me give you, let me take this opportunity, I think, to give you a little bit of color and detail and I'll parse for you sort of the demand picture, because I think I want you all to understand the demand signals in their totality. So what I'm going to talk to you about is what we have seen so far this year. And I think this context is important. First, Gulfstream continues to perform well in the market. This was our strongest third order intake in the last four years. And by the way, it follows the strongest second quarter intake that we had in seven years last quarter. Second, our North American sales activity remains good. And this quarter we saw some resurgence in the international market. Interestingly, with about half of our orders coming from ex-U.S., Asia, Pacific Rim, Australia, Latin America, Mideast. So nice broad order interest and order activity. Third our book-to-bill, as you noted, is wholesome. And fourth, and I think this is also important to recall and understand, our firm backlog for this quarter is $13.6 billion. That's right around the median of our backlog total for three years. So what does that mean? It means that the backlog has been remarkably stable. And by the way, recall that our orders come with good deposits and strong contract terms, so they're rather sticky. So let me give you a little bit of color going forward. Our pipeline is good, as it's been all year. And if you're interested in the piece parts constituents of the pipeline, it's heavily North American which is wholesome. Public, private companies, high net worth individuals. And these are sophisticated buyers, who're interested in fleet replacement and augmentation. So I think as context, that gives you a little bit of color on what we're seeing. Now, with all of that said, there are some non-macro headwinds. We had a competitor with white tails in the G450 and G550 space at very low prices. There are also five to six pre-owned G550s on the market that are less than five years old. And these newer planes are still under warranty. And for some customers, they can be competitive with our new offerings. So with all of that said, we remain pretty cautiously optimistic. I think I gave you a little bit more there, but I wanted you to understand how we're seeing the entire market, because I think it's important to see it in its totality.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's very helpful. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Phebe, you talked about the disconnect between cash generation and cash deployment. And consistently in the past it's been 100% of conversion. And you teed up the 2015 and 2016 explanation thereof. So I'm just curious: how much of the deployment this year – I think that you said somewhere around $3.3 billion year-to-date – is deployed and presumably there'd be more of that in the fourth quarter. How much of that is indicative of what you think free cash flow is once you get through this kind of negative headwind you're seeing in 2015 and 2016? Is that the underlying cash generative base of business that you see out in the 2017, 2018 period of time?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, to the extent that I think that can fully understand your question, we will give you more color on 2016, as we always do, in January of that year. But I'll try to give you some context for 2015 and 2016 and not beyond that, what we see in terms of the cash headwinds. We have those international deposits that we're deploying, as you would expect. And we're building our operating working capital, also as you would expect if you think about it at Gulfstream. So that all flushes out at the end of 2016. So if the essence of your question is there any structural cash generation issue at our company, the answer is no (17:37).
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: By 2017 you see it largely resolved back to the kind of the GD of old, the 100% conversion?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just a clarification. Jason, the tax rate contribution of $0.20 was how much of the raise?
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So it was $0.05 impact in the quarter. And as I mentioned, I think we're expecting closer to 28% tax rate for the year. So you can do the math on what that does to the fourth quarter.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a quick one on IS&T. Obviously, the results there have been much better than you expected. I wondered if you might give us some color on where you're seeing the strength and break out the more traditional service-oriented offerings versus the product-oriented offerings. And maybe comment on the cost structure and your efforts there and what impact that's having. Just a little bit more color on the successes you've been having there.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, so this is a good news story for us. And it's across both Mission Systems and Information Technology. They both had a strong quarter, and they're improving their performance year-to-date. And there is no single area that's driving strength, given the number of programs that we have in that portfolio. There is just constant flux in mix and timing. They have been, but because of their decreased cost structure, they've been winning more than their fair share. So that has added nicely to our book-to-bill which I think year-to-date is about 1-to-1. And those short cycle businesses, that's pretty impressive. So I think it's operating excellence, technical ability, and just focus. So we're very pleased with what they've done.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Phebe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I wanted to get back to Gulfstream. And just two things to understand. One, you've talked in the past about potentially moving forward some G650 production, perhaps adding some in the nearer-term which would help the revenue top-line. Can you comment on that? And then also, where does availability stand on the G450 and G550 now in terms of months ahead?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, let me take them in the inverse order. The G450 and G550 are about three to four quarters. So not much of a change there. With respect to the G650, our production is as we anticipated this year. So no changes to that. But going forward, as we prepare our plan for next year, we'll look to feather in a couple of, and I'm talking about one and two, just a handful – onesies and twosies – feather in some G650s to help offset as we make that transition to entering into service on the new airplane. So that's pretty much what we've been seeing all year and saying is exactly what we're continuing to see.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So Phebe, if you could give us some color on how the flight test program is going, because it's kind of hard to follow as an outsider. What milestones are happening? And if you could just kind of paint a picture for that.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. So our flight test program is going very well. On the G550 we have surpassed G500. We've surpassed more than 100 hours of flight, and we've successfully completed about, I think, 45 missions. On the G600, we've begun construction and is well underway on construction on the test aircraft. And we plan to fly that in 2016. And our entry into service remains unchanged. So going very, very well.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just as a quick follow-on, is there any chance that, that entry into service could happen a little earlier if kind of everything just continues to go smooth?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, that's hard to predict since we don't, but I'm not going to get out ahead of Gulfstream. We're sticking right now to what our original entry into service is. And as we go and we mature and get down the test flight program, we'll have a little bit more clarity. But right now that's what we still see.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Arment (22:47) with Sterne Agee. Your line is now open.
Unknown Speaker: Yes. Good morning, Phebe.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Unknown Speaker: Can you give us an update on your general thoughts of the latest talk on the budget deal, if there's any material impact in terms of your overall plan and just regarding, in particular, regarding Combat? It seems like the mix there continues to favor the margin performance. If you could just update how we see the mix going forward. Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, the budget – the prospective budget, agreement would be very welcome news I think from a national security perspective. And certainly for us our programs are fully funded in the President's request and as we understand the proposed budget agreement. So I think that's some very, very good progress made quickly. So we're pleased with that and we would encourage and hope that, that continues since – we're hopeful that, that's all on track. And on Combat, we are continuing. It's between, last year and this year, we've had some mix issues as we came off of mature programs that were in development and at the end of their production runs and started up on a whole series of new programs. But that backlog, and that coupled with the operating excellence of that entire group, positions us quite well for nice earnings growth. And margins should increase over time. If you think about that business as we've got our platform businesses, but we also have our Ordnance and Tactical Systems business. And they had an absolutely terrific quarter. So they are highly focused on their cost structure, operating leverage, and they had a very wholesome book-to-bill in excess of 1-to-1. So for a short cycle business that's very, very good.
Unknown Speaker: Appreciate it. Thank you, Phebe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. I wanted to go back to Marine and the strength there. You talked about it before – submarine driven. Is this a sustainable revenue rate quarterly, Phebe, as we go forward here? It sounds like...
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, think about the submarines in two ways. We're at our – this will be steady state on Virginia Block IV revenues. So what we're seeing now will continue. And we will continue to see and anticipate growth in the Ohio Replacement design work, which has been growing at a very healthy clip. And the growth will slow down but it will continue to grow. So that business is very well positioned for additional revenue increases.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And you see the margins coming back up into the 9%s?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I do.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I wanted to ask Myles' question again maybe from a different direction. The buy-back and the dividends exceeding free cash flow this year, do you think that's something that we should expect again next year? And do you have a sort of leverage target in mind? You've gone back to sort of net debt to cash of basically zero. But do you see it actually moving to a net debt situation going forward?
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So I think one way to think about it is we would never view a net cash position as being optimal and even a break even situation is not optimal. I don't necessarily think we'd characterize as having a target leverage position. So much as we think about having the preservation of the strong balance sheet that allows us to be poised to quickly and readily take a strategic direction when the opportunity presents itself. And as far as capital deployment goes, I'll look at my boss and say I'm not going to speak to our plans for next year and get out ahead of her. But you know where we are today is trying to normalize that deployment of capital to a net income level given that we see free cash flow being somewhat less than net income this year.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And maybe a quick follow up, Jason, as well. On the foreign exchange you mentioned this is something we should watch. What's your hedging situation? Do you have most of these export revenues hedged?
Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So yeah, two parts to answer that question: from the perspective of actual economic exposure in having a foreign currency revenue or expense item in a particular business, we have about 100% hedged and we're totally secure on that front. What I'm referring to strictly is the translation of our indigenous businesses in Spain, in the U.K., in Canada and so on translating those operating results back into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. So it's not an economic loss we're talking about. It's a headwind from a U.S. consolidated reporting perspective. But from an actual economic exposure standpoint we're very comfortably hedged.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So I think some of the wait times, if not all of them by your aircraft platform at Gulfstream actually increased a little bit last quarter including G450 and G550, both the CBs. You've indicated there is some headwinds there in that market right now – call it cross winds, if you will, from obviously a competitor. The question is have you actually scaled back on G450 production at all this year as it relates to the next couple of years of rate? And can you remind us what the wait time is for the G650 right now? Thanks a lot.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So our production for this year is exactly on track. No changes. We're in the process of setting our production rates for next year and we'll give you that color when we report fourth quarter and give you guidance. And the G650 actually, we are one or two slots away from moving to a second quarter of 2018 availability. So that backlog, as wholesome as it is, continues to grow.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I want to go back to the same question I guess in terms of the free cash flow. I guess I'm just trying to think about when you first came in, Phebe, you talked about the M&A organization as being broken and needed to be fixed. And I guess I'm wondering why we haven't seen you make more actions there? Is it the budget outlook? Is it the prices? Is it that you see more value in the stock? Just what would make you change your view towards buyback and start thinking about acquisition?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, so far, we've seen nothing to particular note that's interesting at accretive prices. So I think that's the best way to think about it. We're really not looking because there isn't much out there, from our perspective. So we just continue to keep our powder dry and you'll continue to see us through the course of the year buy back shares as it makes sense tactically.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you. And if I can follow up, is there any way you can size the warranty issue at NASSCO?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. It had to do with a bearing on a drive shaft. And that's to the extent of which I understand the shipbuilding challenge there. But we took the warranty and NASSCO is, we took the charge and NASSCO is all set to, it is poised to recover for next quarter. So that was a one-time event, and it's in our rear view mirror.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Hi, Phebe.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Howard.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: It'll be a little bit like trying to pull teeth here, but we'll see if I can succeed. Your outlook for Gulfstream. They've continued to surprise you, and yet you're being conservative about the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate a little bit more on some of the challenges? Is it higher R&D? Is it mix? Is it something else that causes you some concern about profitability?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So the fourth quarter is going to be lighter than the third quarter. And let me take you back to last quarter when we talked about Jet Aviation and that we were going to see some margin compression in the second half as we began to spend on engineering in the pre-production activities at Basel that we need to do in anticipation of the start of production which begins early next year. That has happened and it will continue into next quarter. So couple that with you've got a higher R&D and lower launch assistance. And that's essentially the story from where we sit right now.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Did you pull any teeth?
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: No, I'm not going to try too hard because you've been pretty consistent and doing a reasonable job there.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Phebe, I'm going to try and follow on to Howard's question. For the margin at Gulfstream to only be 18.5% for the year, it requires the fourth quarter to be down like 16.5% or something. Why would it get that low?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, as I told you, we're seeing a significant margin compression at Jet. And I think that if you back in the math, it's fourth quarter, maybe somewhere around 18%. Yeah. So Jet is a factor. Our R&D spend is going to be higher. There's really nothing other than that. There's nothing structural, if that's what you're getting at.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: What's R&D going be relative to the third quarter?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Up.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay. I'm sure you won't quantify it, but I'll let you go with that. Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Your line is now open.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Phebe, on the G500 could you talk about order interest there, ex the initial fleet buyers that came in for that airplane when you announced it? And then one question about your comments on free cash flow conversion as we head into next year. Are you assuming that advances we see a further draw down on the advances side into 2016? Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, on your latter question. And on the G500 and G600, customer interest has been good. And we expect that interest and demand increase as we progress through the development program and we, frankly, get closer to EIS. So this is an attractive airplane set for our customers.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Phebe, just looking at Combat just given the strong order flow over there the past 18 months or so and the FX pressure that you're seeing this year, what's the growth for that segment look like next year? Some of the international contracts flowing through but just being offset by FX and does that annualize next year?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, as you would expect, we took in a large number of orders into the backlog in 2014 and if you look at the engineering cycle and typically when programs start production, you could reasonably expect that production to begin in 2016 and I think we've been pretty clear about that. But I don't want to get into any more detail on what 2016 looks like until we finish our plan.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much, and good morning. Notwithstanding what you just said about not getting into 2016, I was wondering if you could comment on how the profitability headwind from Jet carries over for – in Aerospace from Jet Aviation – carries over from Q4 into 2016 since you've got some pretty tough margin comps in the first half of the year? The Gulfstream margin was around 20%. And I thought that the cost management in Aerospace was one of the ways to help manage this transition from the G550, G450 to the G500, G600?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, your supposition is right. Cost management is going to be key. The margin compression that we've seen in Jet reverses in the first quarter of 2016 as they begin production. Right now, they're simply in the dueling phase and engineering for these large body and narrow body airline completions. So that's a fair amount of engineering work. We'll get into production then starting in the first quarter of next year.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So that headwind is behind us.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes.
Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations: And Nicole, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey, nice quarter, guys.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey, Phebe, there was some press during the quarter about Bath on the DDG-1000. Could you give us your thoughts on that program? Just how it's going and if there's any financial risk going forward related to that?
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, so let me talk a little bit about DDG-1000. As we've said before this is a highly complex and revolutionary surface combatant. The first of which – we've got three in our backlog and three under construction – the first of which is nearing C trial. So we are continuing to work with the Navy to resolve O&E developmental issues that they see. And I think we all agree that we're working through all of those technical challenges on this first ship. And by the way, I think the bellwether that we used to think about performance on that ship is, you may recall that the complete redesign of the deckhouse on the third ship was reassigned to us, that design is nearly complete and construction is proceeding quite nicely. So that suggests considerable learning and I'm very pleased with at least that performance there. We do have some risks going forward. We'll manage that accordingly. We're working very closely with the Navy and Navy's other subcontractors on this program. But let me give you some sense of magnitude: Bath is 1/32nd of our sales so we are paying quite a bit of attention to what is a complex warship, but I think the context is important here.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Thanks so much.
Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Well, thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, Erin can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Quarter Two 2015 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Matthew and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Erin Linnihan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma’am.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you, Matthew and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Erin and good morning. Well, as you may have observed from our press release, we enjoyed a particularly strong second quarter, with revenue of $7.88 billion and net earnings of $752 million. We reported EPS of $2.27 per diluted share, $0.39 ahead of earnings from continuing operations in the year ago quarter. We were also $0.21 per share better than consensus. Revenue of $7.88 billion is $408 million higher than the year ago quarter. That represents year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5%. Earnings from continuing operations of $752 million is $106 million higher on the strength of 13.7% operating margins, a 100 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. I should note that our earnings include a modest gain on the sale of our commercial cyber products business in the IS&T segment. Excluding that gain, operating margin would be 13.4% and EPS would be $2.22 still substantially better than all comparative quarters and consensus. Sequentially, revenue was up $98 million, or 1.3%, and net earnings are up $36 million on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins. Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2015 and compare it to the first half of 2014. Revenue was up 6.3%. Operating earnings at $2.11 billion are up 15.6%. Net earnings from continuing operations are up over 18%. In short, we are off to a very good start, well ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I will provide some additional color on that guidance shortly. Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and then the half and then I will conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and tie that into our EPS guidance. First, Aerospace, Aerospace had a good quarter with revenue of $2.3 billion, $263 million higher than the year ago quarter and a $55 million improvement in operating earnings. Jet Aviation once again made a strong contribution with double-digit operating margins. For the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of last year, Aerospace revenue was up $246 million or 6%, operating earnings are up $82 million or 10.4% on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margins. Let me spend a moment on the business aviation marketplace. There has been much speculation about it in a lot of what I would call Rumor Intelligence, or RUMINT. From an order perspective, Gulfstream enjoyed its best discrete second quarter since the second quarter of 2008. The end result is an approximate $1 billion increase in the Aerospace group funded backlog, with Gulfstream as the primary reason. The U.S. economy remains strong particularly compared to others in the world. So, it should be no surprise that North America dominated the order book in the quarter. The sales pipeline remained steady across all models. We have seen no decline in the level of interest and a particularly encouraging return of S&P 500 companies as they seek to replenish aging fleets. I should add that the first flight of the G500 occurred in the quarter and the test program is proceeding on schedule. Next, Combat Systems, Combat had a great quarter. Revenue is $1.41 billion, $57 million less than the second quarter last year. However, a 110 basis point improvement in operating margins to 16.1% resulted in a modest increase in operating earnings over the year ago quarter, all-in-all, a very strong performance. For the first half, revenue increased 1.8% against the first half of 2014. Operating earnings are up $71 million or 19.8%, resulting in 230 basis point margin expansion against the first half of last year, pretty impressive. Marine Group revenue of $2 billion is higher than second quarter 2014 by $150 million or 8.1%. Operating earnings are up $13 million or 7.5% against the year ago quarter. Revenue was up nicely on a sequential basis and operating earnings are constant on a 40 basis point reduction in margins. For the first half, Marine Group revenue of $3.94 billion is up $492 million against the first half of 2014. This is a very strong 14.3% growth. Operating earnings are up $35 million, 10.3% on slightly lower margins. Margins were still a very respectable 9.5% for the first half. Marine Systems has been a compelling story for us and will continue to be so. We have a little work to do, however, on margins in the second half. You may recall that IS&T is a place where we expected a 5.5% contraction in revenue for the year. Well, fortunately, we are doing materially better than that. Revenue of $2.2 billion is up $52 million or 2.4% against 2014 second quarter. But the real story is operating earnings. They are up $449 million on a 200 basis point improvement operating margins against the year ago quarter. As I previously noted, the sale of our cyber products business provided some profit in the quarter. On a normalized basis, without that gain, margins would have been 9.7%, an increase of 100 basis points over the year ago quarter. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue is up $141 million or 3.2% and operating earnings are up $83 million over 22% on a 160 basis point improvement. Once again, on a normalized basis, operating margins would have been 9.4%, a 110 basis point improvement over the first half of 2014. This is a very good news story and as you are going to hear in a moment, it will continue. So, let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare this guidance to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance to you in January was to expect revenue of approximately $9.4 billion and operating margins around 18%. We now believe revenue will be off by about $250 million to $300 million. On the other hand, margins are expected to be about 18.5% for the year, resulting in about the same as anticipated operating earnings. The 18.5% margin guidance for the year implies some pressure on margins in the second half due largely to mix shift, increased R&D spending, building airplanes for use in the test program, and a planned reduction in production at Jet Aviation Basel. To that point, we are performing the engineering work at Basel necessary to induct a full complement of airplanes into production in the first quarter next year. For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue similar to 2014 or about $5.7 billion with margins around 15%. We continue to expect revenue consistent with prior guidance. Margins, however, will be in the 40 to 50 basis point higher range resulting in higher-than-predicted operating earnings for the year. In Marine Systems, we previously guided to revenue growth of 2.5% or approximately $7.5 billion and a margin rate in the 9.5% range. We now expect revenue of approximately $7.8 billion, which translates to growth of 6.7% against last year. Margin rates will be about 10 basis points better than previously forecast. The higher revenue and somewhat better margins will once again result in higher operating earnings and earlier forecast. By the way, the operating margin result will be driven by a double-digit fourth quarter. For IS&T, we previously guided to a revenue decline of 5.5% or about $8.7 billion of revenue and a margin rate around 9%. It now appears that revenue will be between $9 billion to $9.1 billion and the margin rate should be about 70 basis points better than guidance. Once again, this will result in higher than previously expected operating earnings for the year. In summary all of this rolls into revenue for the year of $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin around 13% and a return on sales from continuing operations slightly in excess of 9%. So higher than previously anticipated operating earnings, a modestly lower tax rate and a lower share count permit us to increase our EPS guidance for continuing operations to be between $8.70 to $8.80. The progression through the remainder of the year is that we will see a third quarter just weaker than the second and a fourth quarter that looks very much like the second quarter. I would like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I have got just a couple of quick financial items to go over before we start the question-and-answer period. First, I will follow-up on a point we addressed in last quarter’s call and that’s impact we are seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. When you compare our second quarter results to the year ago period, our 2015 revenues and operating earnings would have been higher by $130 million and $20 million respectively, at the exchange rates that prevailed in the second quarter of 2014 remained in effect this year. Combined with the first quarter results, our revenues and operating earnings were reduced by $250 million and $40 million so far this year as a result of the strengthening of the dollar. Stated another way, absent the headwind from the translation of our international business in the U.S. dollars, our revenue growth in the first half would have been 8%. Moving down the income statement, our net interest expense in the quarter was $20 million versus $24 million in the second quarter of 2014. The decline was driven largely by the repayment of $500 million of debt in January. For 2015, we expect interest expense to be approximately $85 million. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position and that’s cash in excess of debt of $690 million. This is down by almost $400 million from the prior quarter due to our capital deployment activities, which I will address in just a minute. Our effective tax rate was 29.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected as we continue to see the benefit of higher international earnings. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the low 29% range. We continue to expect cash contributions to our pension plans for 2015 to be $185 million, and most of that funding is expected to occur in the third quarter. A quick point of color on the cash flow statement is included in our release. One item you will note is cash proceeds from asset sales in the first half of just shy of $260 million. We have mentioned from time-to-time some of the small scaled portfolio shaping we have been doing and that’s what you see there. So that’s primarily the divestitures of our commercial cyber business, which Phebe mentioned just a few minutes ago and AxleTech, which closed earlier in the year. And on the subject of share repurchases. In the quarter, we purchased slightly less than 7.5 million shares for just over $1 billion. We have purchased a little more than 12 million shares in the first half for just shy of $1.7 billion. And in total, when combined with dividends paid, we returned approximately $1.2 billion in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date, well ahead of our free cash flow for the first half. At the end of the second quarter, we have $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet and are well positioned to continue to execute our 2015 capital deployment strategy. Erin that concludes my remarks and I will turn the mic back over to for you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan: Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. Matthew, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: Thanks, Erin. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ronald Epstein: Hi. Yes, good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Jason Aiken: Good morning.
Ronald Epstein: Just maybe a quick question on the biz jet market, the way you characterized it, it sounds great, just – but other suppliers have said maybe not so, so my sense is are you guys picking up share, I mean you have a primary competitor who is kind of wounded out there right now and I am just curious if you are picking up share in the large jet market?
Phebe Novakovic: There has been an awful lot of discussion about reported weakness in that large-cabin market, but not from us. And it’s not automatic that the factors that are impacting others are impacting us. We really don’t think about share. The way we conduct our businesses is that we look at our order which was robust and our pipeline, which remained strong. So I am not in a position to comment what others are seeing, but we are continuing to see interest across all of our product lines.
Ronald Epstein: Okay, great. And then if I can just a quick follow-on, something you didn’t talk about too much on your prepared remarks is how is it going on the Ohio class program now in the ship business and if you can give us an update on that and how the outlook for that looks?
Phebe Novakovic: So Ohio engineering and Virginia construction are really the two main drivers of increased revenue, which is not what you asked but it gives us a certain context. And let me give you some color. We are in the middle of the Ohio replacement design development program and it’s progressing on schedule. We are the prime and we are working on all of the ship arrangement systems, components, development, missile system compartment in order to support the start of the lead ship, which is in 2021. So we are doing very, very well by all indicators in our engineering design efforts.
Ronald Epstein: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Please proceed.
David Strauss: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
David Strauss: Phebe, during the quarter I guess last couple of quarters, we have seen some of your competitors make some moves in terms of M&A, Lockheed with Sikorsky and then Raytheon with Websense, can you talk about how you view M&A today and how you are thinking about capital deployment overall? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So I see M&A today the way I have been seeing it. There is nothing that we are looking at now. Our capital deployment strategy is consistent with what we have been talking to you about. In the absence of accretive and good acquisition candidates in our space, we are going to continue to return cash in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
David Strauss: As a quick follow-up to the Gulfstream order activity in the quarter, could you give us any color in terms of by product line, what you saw maybe on the 650 and what the order activity looks like on the new products, the 500 and 600? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: So, we are not going to dissect for you the demand by product and by airplane, but let’s just – suffice it to say that we had good demand across our entire portfolio and that means our entire portfolio. And when we look at the pipeline, the interest that we see in the pipeline likewise translates to demand signal across our portfolio.
Erin Linnihan: Matthew, can we take the next question please?
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Thanks very much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Phebe, just a point of clarification, did you cut your Aerospace revenue forecast by $350 million versus your previous guidance and if so what has changed that?
Phebe Novakovic: Look, we reduced I think between $250 million and $300 million. And there are an awful lot of moving parts in this business that as we get halfway through the year, we get some additional clarity. It’s really nothing more than across the whole line of our products and services, which is – this is really some moving around among quarters, between fiscal years. But the business is still growing. I don’t particularly see the reduction of the increase in estimates from 8% to 6% particularly its positive for any market factors. It’s simply the management of the business.
Robert Stallard: Is there particular models that have come off more than you originally anticipated, I know you don’t want to give a little detail on this, but is this generally what’s happened?
Phebe Novakovic: No, it’s just as we look – we have got a whole series of moving parts in that business, including building additional airplanes for the test program, mix in our service business and then the mix in any one particular quarter over the fiscal years of deliveries in large cabin and medium cabin. So, we are likely to see some medium cabin, about three or four of them moving to next year, but that’s largely a question of preference on the part of the customers. So, there is nothing material here. It’s simply an update as we get halfway through the year to give you just some more clarity of what we see.
Robert Stallard: Okay, that’s great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Sam Pearlstein: I wanted to go back on the Marine side, I mean, normally a fairly predictable business to go from 2% growth to 6% growth seems unusual. So, I am assuming its Ohio class. And then wouldn’t that cause kind of a negative margin shift rather than a 10 basis point increase? And I don’t know if you can highlight, you said they have a lot of work to do in the second half on the margin front. What needs to happen there?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So, it’s a couple of things that are driving – couple of programs that are driving our revenue. One is increased Virginia class construction. Ohio engineering revenue has increased quite a bit over last year, both of those. And then the commercial ship construction at NASSCO is increasing as our backlog of the ECO tankers and our construction cycles. So, those are the three factors that are increasing our outlook for the year. On margins, we just have some work to do across the portfolio. If you think about what the history has been on blocks of submarines. Block IV is still in its early stages. And so as we continue our reengineering efforts, we expect to realize some cost savings, which will improve performance and margins on Block IV. That’s going to be a longer term proposition. We historically, throughout that program, have recognized higher margins as we progress further into the construction. So, we see some long-term margin expansion opportunities there and we are seeing some – we are seeing very good performance at NASSCO on their ECO tanker construction and on the MLP for the Navy. And then we have got some margin compression at Bath Iron Works that we need to continue to work through on our DDG-1000 program. And I don’t expect that, but often typical of a new class of ships, particularly one that is as powerful and transformational warship as DDG-1000 is. So, we have got a little ways to go on that and we are working with our Navy customer on our vendors and their vendors to get that first ship into sea trials, so more to come.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Phebe, I wondered if we could turn to IS&T or back to IS&T for a minute, talk about what’s driving the strength there? How you look at that business over time? And particularly, on the margins, how much of this is just – is volume driven versus cost reduction as we go forward?
Phebe Novakovic: There is an interesting correlation between volume increases and cost reduction. As you may recall, we have integrated two of our previous standalone businesses in IS&T and Creative Mission Systems and they had a particularly strong quarter across the board. So – and I am continuing to see good continued strength in those areas and I am particularly pleased with their margin improvement, which is driving the higher earnings and frankly allows them to increase their win rate. Their cost-cutting efforts have been exemplary and there is more to come in that business. On our service business, it’s steady year-over-year. And sequentially, they just need to work their margins hard, which is always their challenge in their highly competitive business. But all-in-all, IS&T is doing extremely well and I think will continue to do well. And again, our win rate is better, because our performance operationally is good and our costs are coming down and increasingly pace of which is increasing in cost-cutting, so very impressive.
Robert Spingarn: Yes. And then just as a second question or follow-up, maybe for Jason, on the cash flow conversion for the year, how are you thinking about that relative to before especially now that the forecast is a bit higher from a performance standpoint?
Jason Aiken: I think our expectations for the full year are consistent with what we have said right from the beginning a weaker than – or softer than typical year. Our priority is always to pull cash forward. So, we had a pretty decent performance in the first half. I think we had close to 80% conversion rate free cash flow to net income, but we had predicted before and are still looking at a softer second half as we profile a lot of the supplier payments associated with the advances that we got on some large contracts last year and year before flowing out in the balance of the year. So, I think our expectations are essentially consistent with where we started in the year.
Robert Spingarn: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi.
Myles Walton: Bonus points for using the word axiomatic, Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: I am sure you didn’t have to look it up.
Myles Walton: No, I am engineer. So the one question I have for you was on the backlog in bookings at Gulfstream, in particular. Some other manufacturers have seen the fleet buyers kind of come back and place orders. How much of the strength here is fleet buying? It sounds like it’s not, but I just want to confirm that. And also as it relates to your search for upward bias on the G650 rates, how comfortable are you with where the supply chain can take us?
Phebe Novakovic: So, let’s first define our terms. When we say fleet, what we mean is Fortune 500 companies coming back in and replenishing their entire fleet. And so not surprisingly, the preponderance of our backlog is in public and private companies and high net worth individuals. They comprise a majority of our backlog. I don’t track our – what you can call fractional owners, fractional buyers, but it’s not significant and I don’t really worry about it too much. It’s a very steady backlog when we look at it. We know these people in the backlog. They have been here before and a lot of strengths and consistency.
Myles Walton: And then the supply chain for the 650?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So, the supply chain for the 650, we are thinking about feathering in the 650 over additional ones and two units over time and the supply chain can easily manage that. We have been in discussions with them. And we are not talking about massive changes in the production rate, but simply lot of these [indiscernible] the transition period.
Myles Walton: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Doug.
Doug Harned: Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on the 650 question, because as you have talked about potentially feathering in some earlier, what are you looking for as a trigger to make a decision to bring some 650s forward?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, when we look at our plan for the next couple of years and get some clarity around that, then we will have the ability to ramp up, again not in large order of magnitude numbers, but in ones that are easily manageable. So, that will be largely our planning process that we do in the fall and that will set the guidance that we will give you in the fourth quarter, first quarter of next year. So, there is no catalytic trigger, it’s more our internal planning.
Doug Harned: But when you think about this also in terms of margins, you said recently that the margins had not, on the 650, quite reached the level of the 550. When you look at – how do you look at the margin trajectory now? And how does that tie into potential changes in rate?
Phebe Novakovic: So, the margin potential on the 650, I think we have got another year to 18 months before it eclipses the 550. So, I don’t really think about bringing forward 650s to boost our margins. I am thinking about bringing them forward to just smooth the entire business. And so there are less perturbations as we go through our transition, but we are – we have talked about this quite a bit, the margin performance on the 650 we haven’t seen how good we can get there.
Doug Harned: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: Hi, good morning. It’s actually Jon Raviv on for Jason. A question about – I have question about Jet Aviation and the planned reduction at Basel later in the year, curious what’s driving that and what you are doing to manage that and to what extent that’s driving the lower Aerospace sales outlook?
Phebe Novakovic: That is a – think about it this way. We added significantly to the backlog of Jet Aviation with single aisle and double aisle airplane completions in the first half. So we need to and we are in the process of doing the engineering work, so that we can induct these airplanes in the first quarter and second quarter of next year into the production cycle. So this is a – when you have an inflow of order – orders and the completions on these airplanes require a fair amount of high level engineering on the front end, engineering and design. So to integrate that, get that engineering design done, so we’re ready to move into full rate production at a very efficient rate is I think judicious and was part of our plan all along. You need to do that in order to produce these things that – at a effective margin level and profitability. The Jet Aviation has some impact in the second quarter, if you would imagine, particularly given their double-digit contribution the last few quarters.
Jon Raviv: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi George.
George Shapiro: Phebe if I look at the Aerospace margin for the six months, it’s 19.9. And I would venture for the second quarter if I took out maybe $75 million or $100 million of probably zero margin pre-owned sales, it would have been north of 20%. So what gets the margin down to 17.5% or so on average in the second half or even 17% to get you to average only 18.5% for the year?
Phebe Novakovic: George, for years I have enjoyed your complex questions that are built on a series of assumptions. Let me try to simplify this in the way that we think about it. In the first half, we had a number of factors that contributed to higher margins. One was a fairly significant settlement that we had with a supplier. The second was some R&D tax credit. And then going forward, we are going to increase our R&D spend. Jet Aviation is going to have significantly lower in the half earnings and margin rate as we just discussed. And we have got a whole lot of mix shift issued in the service and when airplanes come into green delivery and final delivery, so it’s awful lot of moving parts, did that help you?
George Shapiro: Yes, that helped some. Just also is it fair to say that revenues in pre-owned were 75 to 100 in this quarter with probably zero profit contribution?
Phebe Novakovic: I don’t really follow that, but that would feel about right. But look, the way to think about this, there is nothing happening in the second half of this year that should cause concern to the underlying structure of the business. It’s simply a matter of different moving parts, it’s a mix in the business, the R&D spend as we build more airplanes into the test program, so I think the way to think about this specifically is there is no underlying systemic issue here, it’s just the normal puts and takes.
George Shapiro: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Cai Von Rumohr: Yes. Phebe terrific numbers.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Cai.
Cai Von Rumohr: So could you give us a little more sense of the low quarterly in Aerospace in the third, in the fourth quarter and maybe, you have two quarters here where you have beaten kind of the cautious guidance you have given us. And maybe the specific variances in the second quarter as to why in that quarter, you were so much better than you kind of indicated you might be? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: Well, we had a wholesome mix on the service side. Service revenue is up and the mix was very wholesome. And Jet Aviation had a terrific quarter. So all in all, that’s helped drive our – what you might think of this outperformance. But look, I think we have tried to talk over the last few years about the futility of attempting to get and predict precise quarterly margin rates at this business that has so many different moving parts different products, different service, mix as an issue, we have got Jet Aviation in there. So it’s – we are comfortable that we are directionally correct. Do we have, with exact precision, what third quarter margins are going to be, they are going to be less and they are going to be significantly less and a little bit better in the fourth quarter. So I think that’s reflecting – that slows down into the overall guidance that we gave you in terms of progression of EPS, which is a lighter third quarter compared to second and a fourth quarter that looks a lot like the second quarter and Gulfstream contributes to that.
Cai Von Rumohr: That’s very helpful. And then on the order front, you have talked about the strength in the U.S. and Fortune 500 companies, you didn’t mention emerging markets, I guess there has been some talk of weakness in China, Russia, Latin America, could you talk about the foreign markets and are you seeing just overall in your Aerospace business, requests for push outs or deferrals or requests for accelerations of plants? Thanks so much.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So we have very carefully controlled and monitored our exposure to the emerging markets because of their great volatility. So we are cautious and I think you have seen that behavior in our dealing and in our interchange with emerging markets. We have some very good reliable customers in each of those markets, but they tend to be hyperbolic in their demand. They are in one quarter, out the next quarter. So there really hasn’t been much activity in the emerging market space for a number of quarters now. I would add that the Mid-East continues to be pretty wholesome for us. And – but the real powerhouse here is North America. And by the way, it’s nice not to have too much exposure to highly volatile markets. You can get yourself down in a boxed can in a big hurry.
Cai Von Rumohr: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you very much.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Howard.
Howard Rubel: Good morning, Phebe. When you became CEO, the agenda was relatively clear, set some standards and if we kind of look back for a moment, the numbers are pretty darn good today and so how do you – I mean we get the bar and the increase right now, but when we looked at sort of the numbers going forward, they are pretty darn good. So how do you raise the bar from here and what are sort of some of the agenda items, because in some cases, this year is well understood and it’s really the challenges beyond that?
Phebe Novakovic: So, let’s give a little bit of retrospective since this management team took over. In 2013, we were largely focused on improving our operations and retiring a considerable amount of risk that we found in the company. We did all of that, so 2014 and continuing into this year was about building that backlog, taking the lower-cost structure that we had invested in and the cost reductions that we have made, along with our strong operating discipline and increasing our backlog very significantly and that worked. And we are not done. You never can take your eye off of operations. Without solid operating performance, everything else becomes ephemeral. So we got to continue to focus on taking costs out, continuous improvement reengineering, efforts aren’t done. And we are – so we take those that low cost basis. And given the backlog, we are poised for growth this year, next year and through my current planning horizon. Our defense companies are growing. We have talked about the transition in Aerospace, but fundamentally, these defense companies across the board, they have the backlog in Combat and Marine and IS&T to continue to grow. So, now it’s about growing earnings, it’s about growing EPS based on increases in revenue and then it’s our productivity. So, I think they are going to see more of the same, focus on the core, blocking and tackling, might not be the sexiest thing, but boy it really makes all the difference in performance.
Howard Rubel: Well, I don’t think you are going to get too many complaints. You have talked about – or Jason talked about the strength of the dollar, but that’s a strength of your European operations, they now become lower costs on the international market and we did see recent order of I think it was out of Denmark. But could you talk for a moment about how that integration has worked? And what kind of aperture that has opened up in terms of opportunities both there and you do a little bit of IS&T also and how that’s being pulled through, please?
Phebe Novakovic: So, when we look ex-U.S. and ex-North America, our efforts in the UK and our European Land Systems have been exemplary and they really are the sort of the parable that describes what the journey the General Dynamics has been on. We take ELS, for example. We always knew that we were going to have to invest in that business, because when we purchased it, it had excess infrastructure. So, we made that investment and their cost structure and the wrap right now is at highly competitive levels. That was the competency of that management team. They are really performing. And all of our expectations were realized, because they did what they needed to do and we supported them in that. So, they have increasingly won every bit that they have been in. And the Denmark win was significant for them. It’s a replacement of the M113 fleet about $500 million. We have been in Denmark for a while, but it was European Land Systems. Both their design excellence, operating performance and their understanding of that very important customer that allowed them to execute and win. In the UK, that’s really been out of the Phoenix, right? I mean, out of the ashes rose the phoenix.
Howard Rubel: Yes.
Phebe Novakovic: We had to dismantle that entire business and turn it over to Land Systems to run the FB program, so the guys you knew how to build Combat vehicles actually were building the Combat vehicle and returned over the remaining IS&T businesses to Mission Systems and both have done a superb job of taking cost out increasing their competitiveness. So, I think you may just have heard, I think it’s earlier this week, maybe even last week, the UK government announced another $630 million service and support contract for the SC program. You don’t get that unless that you demonstrate your performance and we had a very affordable cost structure so that you can support the needs of your customers. So, that to me is as I said it’s a parable of what can go right when you do what you need to do.
Howard Rubel: Thank you.
Erin Linnihan: Matthew, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please proceed.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning Phebe.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Carter.
Carter Copeland: How are you doing? I noted Myles liked the word axiomatic, but I preferred the phrase purported weakness, I thought that was quite concrete.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, well it helps to have been a liberalized measure. I do know the English language and I have known it quite specifically.
Carter Copeland: I like it. I wondered if you might expand a little bit on the brief comment you made around DDG-1000 and the work you have there. Is your plan and the rates, the booking rates there dependent on holding schedule or is there the potential for rework of significance there? Any color you can give us about what remains to be done there in terms of milestones and where the program stands?
Phebe Novakovic: So, the next major milestone for the first ship, cost plus ship is going to sea trials. And the Navy, we have worked very, very closely with. They have, by the way, retained the integration responsibility for this partnership. So, we work very closely with them to work schedule and production so that we have minimized any lever, which is particularly challenging on the first acquired ship, but we are not seeing enormous amounts of rework. This is simply integrating, building and integrating a significantly – this is a huge, huge warship with an array of new technologies. And so that’s some of the challenge. That said the fleet is anxious to get it, because of its clear war fighting capability. So, this is a three class – three-ship class and our close relationship with the Navy has been important in all of us working together to get this war fighting battle start out to the fleet.
Carter Copeland: Thanks a lot.
Erin Linnihan: Okay. Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for joining today’s conference ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter One, 2015 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Emma, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen - only mode. We will conduct a question - and - answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now I’d like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma’am.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you, Emma and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics’ first quarter conference call. As always, any forward - looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Erin. Earlier today we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.14 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.8 billion, operating earnings of slightly over a billion and net earnings of $716 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.20 and were well ahead of analyst expectations on revenue as well. We were also better than our previous guidance and our own expectations. I should point out that we enjoyed an effective tax rate of 29% as opposed to consensus of around 30.5%. This accounted for approximately $0.05 of the outperformance. Jason Aiken will more fully discuss the tax rate a little later. I should further note that the diluted weighted average share count was 334 million for the quarter compared to consensus of approximately 332 million, so none of the outperformance comes from a lower than expected share count. I have asked Jason to give you a little more insight into our share repurchase activity when I conclude my remarks. All in all, this is a truly strong quarter from an operating perspective as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.2% and a return on revenue of 9.2%. It was a good quarter from a cash perspective as well. We had 745 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of 98 million, we had 647 million of free cash flow from operations, about 90% of net income. The general comparisons quarter - over - quarter are pretty compelling compared to the first quarter 2014, revenue was up 519 million or 7.1%. Total defense revenue was up 10.1%, pretty remarkable. Our operating earnings were slightly more than $1 billion, up 17.5% over the prior year’s quarter leading to a 120 basis points improvement in margins. A very strong operating leverage is an important part of the story. Net earnings were up more than operating earnings, primarily due to the previously mentioned lower tax rate. Finally, EPS was up 25.1% over the year ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings , lower tax rate and lower share count. Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of our operating segment. First Aerospace, sales are down by 17 million compared to Q1 2014, less than 1% and down 132 million sequentially against the strong fourth quarter. On the other hand, earnings outpaced the year ago quarter by 27 million, about 6.7% on a 140 basis points expansion in operating margins. Operating earnings were also up 19 million sequentially. The 20.4 operating margin for the group represents the high with both companies contributing. A word of caution here, we are out of the gate fast but this pace is not sustainable from a margin perspective. Orders were not overly strong in the quarter but need to be viewed in the context of a very robust fourth quarter 2024. It was a quarter where the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of the normal cycle after a strong quarter. This is consistent with what we saw on the first quarter 2014 following the strong fourth quarter at 2013. We’re off to a very good start in the Aerospace group. Marine Systems, revenue of 1.94 billion was up 342 million or 21.4% compared to the year ago quarter and down 97 million sequentially as one would expect against the fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings were up 22 million or 13.3% against the year ago quarter and down 5 million sequentially. We have particularly good performance at Electric Boat in NASSCO. Some of the more striking comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, sales were up 105 million or 8.3% and earnings were up 65 million or 46.8% on a 400 basis points improvement in operating margins. Recall that the results in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by a 29 million restructuring charge at European Land Systems as a result of reductions in the Austrian operations which were consolidated in Spain and Switzerland. If we disregard that charge, margins would have been 13.4% on a pro forma basis. Even on that basis, the improvement in this year’s operating margins is a significant 160 basis points. Sequentially, revenue was down 251 million and operating earnings are down 67 million as anticipated in the business to always have a very strong fourth quarter largely related to contract delivery. All up, continued strong performance at Combat Systems. It’s been a long times since we’ve been able to report an increase in revenue in this group. IS&T, the big upside surprise incurred this group. You might recall that our guidance was to expect a revenue decline of 5.5% year - over - year, well that certainly did not happen in the first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was up 89 million or 3.9% against the year ago quarter and off only 98 million against the powerful fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings of 217 million were 34 million more than a year ago quarter, up 18.6% on a 120 basis points improvements in margins. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up 5 million on a 60 basis points improvement in margins once again nice operating leverage. The 9.2% operating margins was the best that this group has achieved in a while and is very encouraging. The trend is in the right direction. So we’re off to a very good start to the year, nicely ahead of our expectations. We do not as a practice change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice and has been for three years to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Sufficed to say that we are ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance is based. We will work to consolidate our improvement and continue to outperform. I’d like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I want to start with the subject that we haven’t talked about a lot in the past and that’s foreign exchange rates. With our increasing international revenue base and the continued strengthening of the dollar we’re seeing an impact in our reported results. Now to be clear this doesn’t involve any economic gain or loss in any of our contracts, what I’m referring to is the translation of our international operating results from their local currencies to US dollars for reporting purposes. Absent the movement of foreign currency translation rates, the growth in our revenues and earnings over the first quarter of 2014 would have been even more robust than the numbers you see. Specifically, our US dollar reported revenues and operating earnings in the quarter were reduced by approximately 120 million and $20 million respectively compared with the exchange rate that prevailed in the first quarter of last year. In addition, our backlog was reduced by 450 million from year end due to the same translation issue. Setting the FX impact aside, our Combat Systems backlog would have been essentially unchanged from year end and our IS&T backlog would have been up slightly more than reported. Moving on to a couple of items on our income statement, net interest expense in the quarter was $21 million versus $22 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we repaid $500 million of maturing fixed rates notes with proceeds from marketable securities on hand. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position that’s cash in excess of debt of $1 billion essentially unchanged from year end. As Phebe mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate was a bit lower than we had forecast and a bit lower than analyst consensus of around 30.5%. The effective rate was 29% for the quarter versus 30.1% a year ago and the primary driver was some R&D tax credit claims that were settled during the quarter. For the year, we are now anticipating an effective tax rate in the ballpark of 29.5%. On the capital deployment front you may recall that in the first quarter of last year we repurchased to a little over 14 million shares including about 11 million shares under an accelerated share repurchase program. Since the end of the first quarter of 2014, our diluted share count is down another 12.5 million shares the result of almost 20 million additional shares repurchased in the past four quarters and that includes approximately 4.7 million shares repurchased in the first quarter of this year. Altogether, we spent $826 million on share repurchases we spent 826 million on share repurchases during the first quarter or 1.3 times of free cash flow from operations. Erin that concludes my remarks, I’ll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Emma, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.
Operator:
. :
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning.
Sam Pearlstein: Could you talk a little bit more about Aerospace and the margin? I mean you said that is was not sustainable but there were a couple of headwinds that you had identified before what might hold the margins back this year and so I guess what of that did we not see in the quarter?
Phebe Novakovic: So as we’ve talked about before Aerospace margins tend to be lumpy and estimating that with precision is kind of like putting the tail on a moving donkey. But that said in the quarter, we had a very favorable service mix high service levels with a good mix. We recognized some tax credits, suppliers’ settlement. So it was really more on the upside than really any headwinds but the risk of getting ahead of our second quarter guidance I’ve already noted to you that our quarter one margins were above our expectations and we’re going to beat the guidance I gave you in January I’m just not sure by what amount. So I want to reserve those commentary to the second quarter.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Raviv: Hi, good morning. It’s actually Jon Raviv in for Jason. Thanks for taking my question.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Jon.
Jonathan Raviv: Phebe, just an notional question or high level question about your net cash position, what are you seeing in terms of deployment opportunities here given your very attractive balance sheet?
Phebe Novakovic: Well we’re in a net cash position at the moment which Jason referred to and we tend to no debt position not trying to say net cash. I think we gave you guidance and our intention in January call we will deploy in the absence of any alternatives if there aren’t any we will deploy all of our free cash flow and then to some to share repurchases and that strategy hasn’t changed.
Operator: Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please proceed.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning Phebe, Jason.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Carter.
Carter Copeland: Phebe, I wondered if you could elaborate a little bit on the big surprise on the top line and IS&T obviously it’s your shorter cycle business quite a big revenue delta from what you had talked about in the prior quarter. Wondered if you could just give us some color on what it was that shifted or came in into the quarter? How should we think about thinking of the impacts on the remainder of the year in terms of performance and just any color you could give would be great.
Phebe Novakovic: So, we had an increased sales activity across both Mission Systems and our GD IT business. our Mission Systems it was driven part by lower cost structure that we anticipated as a result of combined AIS and C4 which made us more competitive and that tends to be a pretty quick turnaround so some of the orders quickly turn into sales. We had good book to bill by the way in that program or in that whole group so that also us well for greater growth. But as we combined those two businesses we’re seeing some additional sales volumes that comes in by the strength of going to market. On the IT business they’ve won most of what they’ve been bidding on. They are a power in the market space. And so look I don’t have a sense of where we’re going to end up in that business in particular given all the puts and takes by the end of the year but we’ll have a real good sense by the end of next quarter. But a solid beat on revenues and we’re very pleased.
Carter Copeland: Thanks, Phebe.
Operator: Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Morning.
Robert Stallard: Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the Aerospace side in terms of the large cabin markets and may be give us a feel of what some of the different regions particularly you’re looking overseas outside the U.S?
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. The activity levels I would call as careful, in other words, we’ve got plenty of pipeline but slow to contract not unlike what we’ve seen in prior quarters. In short, North American and the Mid - East are okay. Russia, Latin America and China are slow at the moment, 650 ER demand is robust so we’re holding our own and then some. I think however, it’s important to understand the of the case behind how we’ve won this business how we have historically and how we will continue to do so. The only decline we worry about is a decline in earnings. So accordingly, we always throw production down in the face of weak orders. We have no intention of doing so this year. Given our large 650 backlog we can, to some degree, feather in more 650s to cover potential downfalls and of course we always take cost out of that business. So I think the way to think about both streams for the next two years is not necessarily as a strong revenue growth story. Gross over turn for the new airports enter into service and this is pretty much in line with what we had anticipated and predictable in a business that continues to refresh its product line with clean sheets design airplanes. So, I thought it would be helpful to give you a little sense of when we see changes in demand how we act but I’d say that the first quarter was cautious coming after a robust fourth quarter and this is pretty much of what we have seen in the first quarter for the last couple of years.
Robert Stallard: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe just may be pick up on the last question I think you said the next couple of years, and just on the G500 entering the service it does seem like you’re certainly ahead of where you could be? But without pulling for the schedule in this conference call, green deliveries will there be a source of good revenue growth in 2017 like the 650 was in 2011?
Phebe Novakovic: So, we’ll start to recognize activity in 2017 in anticipation of entry into service in the first quarter of 2018. It’s really in the next two years and it’s a transition period, I think that’s how you should think about it and we anticipate it that as well. And you could expect that given that we’ve got new airplanes coming on.
Myles Walton: And just which was on the inventory of used aircraft, you sold one in the quarter, did the level of used inventory that you’re holding rise, fall or stayed the same?
Phebe Novakovic: No, it was the same.
Myles Walton: Same. Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Yes, good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Doug.
Doug Harned: Just continuing on with Gulfstream, when you look at the transition period and think about what trajectory might be for 450 and 550 deliveries, could you give us a sense on how you envision that going or sort of what their backlogs are right now for those airplanes? And then when you think about it, as you said before, you have the ability to take 650 up, given a lot of strong demand for that airplane, do you see the potential to increase rates some on 650 within that next two year period?
Phebe Novakovic: So, we haven’t given you the backlog and broken it up by aircraft model, but again let’s just talk about the theory of the case. When you’re bringing in new aircraft, the trick is to feather in that production with the existing plane. So that you have a nice, smooth transition and that’s what we’re striving for and that’s what we will achieve. There’s no reason to think that that isn’t going to happen. The 650 has a quite a significant order book and in fact, the deliveries the next to billable airplanes has actually slipped to the fourth quarter to ‘17. So that healthy and long backlog gives us some flexibility, nice flexibility to feather in some more 650s to offset that transition period the feathering in as we move to the new airplanes. So wouldn’t be all together a bad thing either that would reduce the wait time on those 650s and the 650 ER demand.
Doug Harned: So you are seeing the potential to - the demand out there to do some earlier 650 deliveries if you want to?
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. We’re going to be prudent about it. It’s not wise to eat through your backlog, but to the extent that we can and want to we will feather in some additional 650s if that makes sense.
Doug Harned: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi.
Robert Spingarn: Jason, I’ve got one for you if I could, it’s on the free cash flow which was really quite strong in the quarter. I think Phebe said last quarter that international advanced timing would put some pressure on free cash flow this year and it did in the quarter, but their collections looked very strong. Could you talk about working capital and how we should think about the cadence of free cash flows and go forward through the year?
Jason Aiken: Sure. We were, as you said, off to a strong start in the first quarter and to be quite frank, stronger than even we had expected. As we signaled coming into the year, we’re expecting a bit of a softer cash flow outlook and as you think would expect in response to that our business has turned toward sort of war on operating working capital and went after it hard first quarter. And really that is the story. You could see even despite a pretty big draw down in the customer advances related to some of those international programs otherwise excluding that OWC was down in the quarter. So, really strong performance out of the gate, I would caution you that we don’t necessarily expect the first quarter to be reflective of the full year. We’re still expecting a tough road ahead with some of the headwinds that we’ve talked about. But really our focus is all about that management at OWC and going after the collections as well as the supply side.
Robert Spingarn: Is there any particular timing we should think about where some of this strength reverses? I mean I guess for the year you’ll do about a 100% as you normally do or little better, but is there a weak quarter in here?
Jason Aiken: I would suggest the second half is where most of the pressure is there on that front. So we’ll be managing that through the balance of the year.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you and terrific performance, Phebe. Well done.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Cai.
Cai von Rumohr: So, Aerospace, may be if you could kind of give us the numbers you give us on the lead times on each of those programs and little color. You mentioned the suppliers settlement may be if you could quantify any one - timers that bolstered the numbers in the first quarter at Aerospace? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: Yeah, so as I noted the 650 and 650 ER are out to the fourth quarter ‘17 G550 G450 out in 12 month where they have been, G280 and G150 G280 at the end of this year 150 first quarter next year. So pretty much consistent with what we’ve been reporting all along. As I tried to explain earlier we had a number of moving targets in the Gulfstream margin provided considerable margin improvement service mix we took in some tax credits. We did have that supplier settlement I’m not going to give you any particular numbers on any of these and jet performed well. So couple of those are one timers but I’m not going to quantify them for you I don’t think that’s productive. We’re very particularly with respect to our suppliers we are very proprietary about talking about our relationships with our suppliers.
Cai von Rumohr: Can you quantify the total of all of those without giving any of the granularity?
Phebe Novakovic: Yeah, I mean we’ve led you to about 18% for the year I didn’t give you by quarter - by - quarter as I explained to you before we get real lumpiness in Aerospace margins which we’ve talked about. So I’m not prepared to change the year guidance but you can back in to some of that. As I said, this is - both streams has an awful lot of moving parts and so does Jet Aviation so, we have seen in the last couple of years lot of lumpiness. We’re not going to see that 20% repeated going forward as explained to you we’re going to outperform I just don’t know I have much yet and I can’t discuss that half way through the year.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you very much.
Operator: Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yes. Good morning, Phebe, Jason.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi.
Peter Arment: Phebe, may be just to stay on Aerospace, you mentioned Jet Aviation continues to be a positive contributor. Can you give us little more color on what you’re seeing there and also related to that are you seeing any kind of slowdown in utilization rates in the large cabin tight kind of the energy market just given these sell off the way we see it last six months?
Phebe Novakovic: We continue to build that business. They’ve been a positive contributor on both cash and earnings for the last 2.5, 3 years. We’ve seen no change in demand as a result of - no decrease in demand as a result of the change in oil prices, in fact, we’re seeing higher demand. Backlog, the pipeline is good and we’re adding to the backlog. So, that business is increasingly well positioned.
Peter Arment: Thank you.
Operator: Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel: Thank you very much.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi, Howard.
Howard Rubel: How are you?
Phebe Novakovic: Good.
Howard Rubel: I don’t want to leave Marine alone here.
Phebe Novakovic: Good.
Howard Rubel: I mean you did spend a little time there, so I figure it’s probably a worn off a little on you. So there’s couple things that stand out. One was the backlog growth second was you kind of LHA post shakedown availability which sort of sets you up to do some interesting things. And it looks like NAASCO did pretty well in a world where commercial is hard to do. So, may be you could talk a little bit about some of the variances and is this sustainable rate you’re seeing in Marine or was there some deliveries or some other material items that sort of tweak the numbers?
Phebe Novakovic: I think what you can expect is Marine will replicate its behavior in the past such as steady Eddy. There was no one particular element that drove margin performance. With respect to sales growth, that’s coming from a couple of places. We have increased sales at NAASCO on commercial work, and remember we’re moving into the Block IV which brings with it higher revenue and also we’re seeing increased revenue on the engineering and design for Ohio replacement. So, all of those are long - term programs that will continue to carry revenue and predictable earnings with them.
Howard Rubel: And just to follow up for a moment, how is it that - what have you done there to make sure, for example at NAASCO, that there’s some opportunity to continue the business because I know that’s always challenging from time to time? And then also, making sure that Ohio replacement stays on schedule.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, so with respect to NAASCO, they’ve got a nice backlog commercial and government may be new construction and recall, repair continues to grow for NAASCO. We have a bi - coastal presence back when I was AVP of the Marine Group, we’ve got a couple of East Coast repair yards that have done beautifully. So we’ve really increased our hiring power in repair and we’re performing very nicely. The repair business is moving to and the Navy is moving to from cost plus contracts to fixed pricing repair in selected instances. And that’s a real upside potential for us, we’re really pleased with that. So, the repair business is robust. NAASCO is performing well, they keep their cost bases low for continuous improvement and that is a highly functioning shipyard. So, I like where they stand. They’re competitive in the commercial market space and of course, [indiscernible] as well continues to drive down its cost structure. And we’ll see over time increased margin improvement as we get further into Block IV in a continuous improvement. Every time you start a new Block, we have some questions in margins we’ve given back some of the goodness of the prior Block to the Navy, but we, over the last decade plus, reduced cost structure and continue to improve margin. So, they’re very, very well positioned.
Howard Rubel: Thank you.
Operator: Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
David Strauss: Phebe could you dig in a little bit more into the growth that we saw at Combat, it sounds like it came through ahead of what your expectations were? Was this [indiscernible] you in case starting to ramp up and does it accelerate from here?
Phebe Novakovic: I lost part of your question, it broke up. Could you repeat it for us?
David Strauss: Can you hear me now?
Phebe Novakovic: Yeah. I can hear you now.
David Strauss: I was asking if you could dig a little bit more into the growth at Combat, it sounded like it did come through ahead of your expectations, is that in the UK program starting to ramp and does that actually accelerate from here? And then a separate question, press has report that you pulled out of a couple of programs in the quarter, competitions TX and Manpack if you could just touch on those as well? Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. So look you would expect with the prodigious increase in backlog that we experienced last year that we begin to see that backlog turn into sales and revenue increases and that’s what you’re seeing in that group. But across the portfolio, on our Canadian Middle East contract, we are finishing up our design efforts and the initial variance and we are going to begin production later this year. The delivery is in ‘16 on the UK program, we’re working some small quantities of pre - productions but again, that will begin to ramp up and there is - the army is increasing its capitalization in their wheel and track vehicles, so all of that is upside and that we’ve recognized some of that. So look, that backlog is still flowing into sales and the key there is to perform on that backlog. So let me talk to you, you asked the second question that is kind of interesting that we have pulled out some competitions, let me give you a sort of theory of the case here. We are not going to compete for programs to respond RFPs where we do not believe that we can get a fair and sufficient returns. Chasing revenues that don’t have good earnings doesn’t help us or our shareholders. So this really has more to do with the discipline with how we run our company rather than the response in any particular program. We’re just not going to compete in programs what we think that we can’t make up their return and a good return.
David Strauss: Thank you.
Operator: Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please proceed.
Ronald Epstein: Good morning, Phebe. I just wanted to touch base quickly if you could remind us what you’re thinking about capital allocation, particularly there’s some new properties on the market right? I mean that might be an opportunity for you guys to do some vertical integration? Just what are you thinking about, M&A, vis - à - vis cash return to shareholders?
Phebe Novakovic: Yeah, so Ron I’m not thinking about M&A because I’m not seeing anything. So it’s again not on my radar screen. And our intent with respect to capital deployment remains the same for this year. We’re going to return capital to our shareholders and share repurchases and dividend. So I think that’s pretty much consistent with what we’ve been doing and what we’ve been saying. Okay?
Ronald Epstein: Yeah, that’s great. Can I ask one quick follow on if I may?
Phebe Novakovic: Sure.
Ronald Epstein: Could you give us a quick update on how things are proceeding with the G600 program the development there and the developments on the G500 program?
Phebe Novakovic: So we’re proceeding well on both the near term G500, we had our first flight this quarter and we’re on track with no particular surprises. And the G600 we’re starting to build the first prototype so all’s well. We’re on track and in line with our expectations were.
Ronald Epstein: Okay. Just curious if there’s any chance that the 500 could happen sooner, if certified sooner?
Phebe Novakovic: You mean first flight or entry into service?
Ronald Epstein: Entry into service, yeah.
Phebe Novakovic: That will depend on the FAA’s test program so that’s really - we work really closely with the FAA. They have an important job to do and we’re really working together there of pacing items here.
Ronald Epstein: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Hunter Keay: Good morning. Thanks for the time.
Phebe Novakovic: Hi.
Hunter Keay: Hey Phebe, I want to follow up on the question in your response to David’s question, the comment on TX specifically or just broadly about how you’re not going to invest on. We’re not going to be it on programs that don’t provide fair or decent returns to your shareholders. Was there something about the comment about TX specifically but there was something about the way that particular program was structured that appealed to you or was it more a comment was broadly about investments it would require from you guys given that’s not sort of in your core wheel house to participate in that program with the sort of ambiguous return? The latter?
Phebe Novakovic: To fit in the nutshell. It’s not in our core. We had been thinking about participating on the air front was interested in the off the shelf trainer. Once the climate started to change there isn’t just no way that becomes an attractive program for us. So I think the appropriate response and good discipline what’s the prior that we just politely bow out.
Hunter Keay: Okay, thank you, Phebe. And then quick follow up, can you update the pre - owned delivery expectations this year or you’re still thinking it’s going to be up year over year how should we think about that? Thanks for the time. In Aerospace.
Jason Aiken: Yeah, I think as we look at the year we’re still expecting the numbers to be up a little bit from what we see in the past couple of years so little bit lighter in the first quarter than what we were expecting but balance of the year we’re still seeing that coming.
Hunter Keay: Okay. Thanks everybody.
Operator: Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.
Peter Skibitski: Hey great quarter guys.
Phebe Novakovic: Thank you.
Peter Skibitski: Phebe, I just wanted to go further on capital deployment. I like when I’m hearing about stay away from M&A frankly it kind of begs the question on repurchases because I think you got a new 10 million authority in February. And I’m guessing coming out of the quarter probably only left about 7 million shares, you’re probably going to do 2 billion plus in cash for the rest of the year so I’m wondering do you plan to go back to the board some time may be this summer to increase the authority?
Phebe Novakovic: So look, we came at out of the Gate strong on cash as I told what I told the Street on January is the way you think about 2015 cash is that we’re going to have a lighter cash year than we typically do have. And I’m not prepared to change that. So do not think about the cash generation in terms that we have historical terms. But that said, let Jason give you a little more color on where we are on the share repurchases.
Jason Aiken: Yeah, I think you were pretty close on your estimates there. We had about 2 to 2.5 billion shares remaining by our buyer authorization when we got the additional 10 million in February. And I think we’re sitting with right around 7.7 or so remaining at this point so. So I think that I’ll look at Phebe but anything beyond that at the discretion of our board.
Peter Skibitski: And hey Jason I didn’t hear you object when Rob suggested a onetime free cash conversion for the year?
Jason Aiken: No, I think as Phebe signaled and I apologize if I missed that question or his predicate, as Phebe mentioned we’re not expecting to be quite as strong as their traditional performance this year. So expect something little bit lighter than that little bit lighter than the first quarter.
Peter Skibitski: Okay, thank a lot.
Phebe Novakovic: Emma I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Okay, so your last question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi from Stifel. Please proceed.
Joe DeNardi: Phebe with IS&T and some of the outperformance you’ve seen there really over the past, 12 months at this point is it more a reflection of the budget environment and the procurement behavior being better than expected or is that the win rate has been better?
Phebe Novakovic: We’re seeing a little bit more activity on the budget side but it’s really our win rate has improved as we continue to take cost out of our business we become more competitive. And by the way that’s true in the United States, Canada and the UK which is where Mission Systems placed heavily.
Joe DeNardi: Okay, thank you.
Erin Linnihan: Okay. Well thank you for joining our call today. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703 - 876 - 3583. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This concludes this presentation. You may now disconnect and have a good day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shantelay and I will be your facilitator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Erin Linnihan. Please proceed.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you Shantelay and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Erin. Earlier today we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.19 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.36 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $737 million. It was our strongest revenue performance in the past 12 quarters, the highest operating earnings ever and the highest earnings from continuing operations. For the year we had fully diluted earnings per share of $7.83 on revenue of $30.85 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.7 billion, a return on sales of 8.7%. It was a year of solid achievement from both an operating perspective and the development of significant backlog. As you can see from schedule H to the press release, funded backlog grew from $38.3 billion at year end 2013 to $52.9 billion at the end of last year. The story for total backlog is much the same. We were at $45.9 billion at the end of 2013 and sit at $72.4 billion at the end of 2014. As a result, we are well positioned for growth in 2016 and 2017. Free cash flow from operations was a negative $254 million in the quarter. However for the year we had free cash flow from operations of $3.2 billion or 123% of earnings from continuing operations. This outpaced 2013 by 532 million. Let me give you some detail on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, aerospace. Revenue and earnings were up nicely over the year ago quarter. Sales were up 105 million, 4.9% and earnings were up 64 million, a significant 18.4% on very strong margin improvement. This is particularly impressive when one considers that G&A and net R&D were up $40 million over the year ago quarter.  On a sequential basis, sales were up $49 million but earnings were up 1 million on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins. I should add that Jet remained nicely profitable in the quarter with a better contribution on both a year ago and sequential comparison basis.  The order activity in the quarter was robust as one would expect with the announcement of two new aircraft. As you can observe, on Exhibit H, funded backlog – total backlog and total potential contract value, including options are all up significantly. Even if we were to ignore the orders related to the two new aircraft, total orders from current production aircraft were the highest of the year. All large cabin aircraft had a dollar based book to bill greater than 1 to 1.  For the year, revenues were 8.65 billion in operating earnings or 1.61 billion on an operating margin of 18.6%. This is a year over year improvement of 6.5% on sales, 13.8% on earnings and 120 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at aerospace with strong operating leverage.  At combat systems, sales were up 23 million or 1.4% and earnings were up 21 million or 8.4%, on a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin over the year ago quarter. Sequentially the story is similar. Sales were up 219 million and earnings were up 39 million. For the year sales were down 100 million or 1.7% and earnings were down 46 million or 5.1%. This compares quite favourably to the guidance we provided at this time last year. You may recall that we guided to a 4 to 4.5. Revenue declined as opposed to the 1.7% decline that occurred.  We also guided the operating margins of 14% which we beat by 100 basis points. Overall combat systems is a story of solid additions to backlog, better than anticipated revenue and outstanding cost and margin performance. This is a business group that has clearly stabilized.  Margin group revenue in the quarter exceeded $2 billion for the first time ever. Operating earnings of 193 million were the second highest ever recorded. Revenue was up 410 million or 25.2% compared to the year ago quarter and up 220 million or 12.1% sequentially.  Revenues for the year were up 600 million, almost 9%, very nice growth. Operating earnings were up 34 million or 21.4% against the year ago quarter and up 23 million or 13.5% sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up 37 million or 5.6% on a 30 basis point decline in operating margins, attributable to mix shift which was consistent with our guidance to you.  In the marine group, we guided you at this time last year to a revenue increase of 2.5% which we obviously exceeded. We forecasted margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.6%, all in all a very good year for the marine group.  IS&T is a business group where we saw less than expected revenue decline and improved operating performance. Revenue in the quarter was 2.47 billion, down 223 million or 8.3% against the year ago quarter. Revenue was up 9.8% sequentially and down 1.1 billion or 10.8% for the year. Remember that this is dramatically less than the 20% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year.  Operating earnings of 212 million in the quarter were 8.2% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up 10 million or 5%. For the year, earnings were down only 10 million or 1.3%, which is very good performance in the face of a 10.8% revenue decline. On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in the 8.2% range which we beat by 40 basis points. All in all, we beat forecasted revenue by $1 billion and operating margins by 40 basis points. When that happens, the result is a very pleasant upside surprise.  So company wide, on this call a year ago, our guidance for 2014 was to expect revenues of 30 billion, operating margin rate of 12%, a tax rate of 31% and the return on sales of 8%. We wound up the year with revenues of 30.85 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.6%, an effective tax rate of 29.7% and a return on sales of 8.7%.  We provided EPS guidance of $6.80 to $6.85. We wound up at $7.83. About $0.62 of the improvement came from better than planned operating performance, $0.13 from slightly lower than planned tax rate and the balance from share count as a result of share repurchases.  So let me provide you some thoughts about 2015, initially by business group and then on a company wide roll-up. In aerospace, we expect revenues to be approximately 9.4 billion, up about 8.3%. Margin rate should be approximately 18%, somewhat down from 2014 attributable in part to less favorability at Jet. Nonetheless up about 4.5% in earnings.  In combat systems, we expect both revenue and earnings to be essentially flat with growth resuming in 2016 and beyond. The marine group is expected to have revenue growth of 2% to 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range, resulting in a very modest improvement to operating earnings.  Finally, in IS&T, we expect a revenue decline of about 5.5% but improved margin rate of slightly more than 9%. This will result in improved operating earnings year over year. We expect the last year to be our low watermark for revenue. In part, we are seeing some of the decline we anticipated last year being delayed into this year. Once again we should see revenue growth in 2016 and 2017.  All of this rolls up to an operating plan of about $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion of revenue, EBIT rate around 12.8% and a return on sales of roughly 8.7%. This plan is purely from operations, assumes a 30.5% tax rate, assumes we buy enough shares to hold the share count steady with year end figures so as not to permit dilution from option exercise. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year’s guidance of $6.80 to $6.85 at the same time on the same basis.  So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from out-performing the operating plan and the effect of share repurchases.  So how should one think about the quarterly progression of EPS? Whatever your model is for the year, divide by 4. And the first and the second quarters will be light by about $0.10, the third quarter about right on and the fourth quarter about $0.20 better. By the way, quarterly progression is notoriously difficult. With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2015 for dividends and share repurchases. While we don’t anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective, in light of the advance payments on international orders that we have received last year, we intend to treat the free cash available for dividends and share repurchases on some normalized basis. In short, we will use balance sheet as necessary to normalize the year.  I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer Jason Aiken.
Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I will take just a minute and cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the question and answer period.  Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. And for the year interest expense was $86 million, consistent with the year before. For 2015, we expect net interest expense of around $82 million, a decline from 2014 resulting from the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that matured last week.  At the end of the year, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, that’s cash in excess of debt of $477 million. This was down by about $1 billion from the end of 2013, reflecting the cash we used from the balance sheet for capital deployment activities which I will address in just a minute.  Our effective tax rate was 29.5% for the quarter and 29.7% for the year, and that’s a bit lower than we had been forecasting. As you will recall our most recent projections were in the neighborhood of 30% to 30.5%. Lower outcome is attributable to the R&D tax credit extension in late December. For 2015, as Phebe mentioned, we expect an effective tax rate of around 30.5%.  And finally, on the income statement, you will notice we took a charge in the quarter in discontinued operations. This is related to the sale of our AxleTech business which we first reported in the second quarter when we made the decision to sell that business. The charge we took at the time was predicated on the 2014 closing of the sale. The regulatory review process for the transaction delayed the closing until the 5th of January and as a result we were not able to take advantage of some tax benefits we’d anticipated. So we adjusted the loss on the sale in the fourth quarter. Switching gears, we contributed $515 million to our pension plan in 2014 and for 2015 we expect that amount to decline to approximately $185 million as a result of the interest rate relief from the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014.  On the capital deployment front, to summarize our activities for the year. We delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In total we expended approximately $3.4 billion on share repurchases in 2014 and when you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $4.2 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2014 or 1.3 times our free cash flow from operations for the year. Erin, that concludes my remarks and I will turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan: Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question, so that everyone has the chance to participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. Shantelay, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS.
David Strauss : Phebe, could you give us a little bit more detail on the free cash flow outlook? It sounds like it’s going to be lower. Could you maybe peg it as a percent of net income in 2015 and what exactly – how much of that is in advance drawdown in terms of the pressure on free cash flow?
Phebe Novakovic: So we tend not to give you specifics as a percentage of net income on our free cash flow. But suffice it to say it’s going to be less robust as a result of our drawdown in our deposits. But we will intend to normalize our free cash flow using our cash on the balance sheet to effect any capital deployment. I think that’s about as much color as we yearly give you and as much as we are prepared to give you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ron Epstein : Just a quick question for you on Gulfstream. How do you expect I guess the sales profile for the business to go when you are leading into the ramp up of the new models, right, so maybe a better way to say, the transition between kind of the old models and the new models, would you expect the profile of the business to continue to grow?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. We do expect the profile to continue to grow in the near years, but at less of a rate than it will grow when we introduced an entry into service of the new airplane. So we have growth between now and entry into service of the G500 and we’d expect accelerated growth going forward from there. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn : Hi. Wanted to talk a little bit about marine and the strength you talked about there, your very strong fourth quarter and how things do trend as we go through ’15 especially on some of the development work you’re doing on upcoming programs? 
Phebe Novakovic: Okay. 2014 growth was driven by higher than expected volume on Block IV electric boat, more unplanned repair work in addition of commercial volume, and we anticipate that those growth elements to continue into next year albeit at a less of a rate of increase. Our developmental work primarily on Ohio replacement ballistic missile submarine continues at pace for the sole source on that, on track and we’re year over year increasing work on that contract. And it’s going very well. So we like where we are positioned there. 
Robert Spingarn : And what you said, the fourth quarter itself – you said, I think the strongest quarterly revenues you’ve seen, how do we think about just the timing there?
Phebe Novakovic: Well we have continued to see growth this year at about 2% to 2.5%, which is, I think, very good in this environment, and that growth will continue into the outyears as we get more volume on Block IV – now we continue to do additional work on our commercial volume, repair work fluctuates but has year over year been growing and we began work on the fourth MLP. So we’ve got growth engines for marine group. We did obviously last year, we do into this year, and we do in the future. We have been telling a growth story for the last two years at marine group and you saw it manifest itself in 2014. It’s going to continue to 2015 and into the foreseeable future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr : Yes, so I guess I am a little confused at GulfStream, if your sales go up to 9.4, a nice sales gain, and we’re getting improving profitability on the 650, why are the margins down? I mean Jet just isn’t that big a part of the business and what’s – maybe give us a little more color on the delivery mix if you could?
Phebe Novakovic: Sure. So we have a slightly – so there are couple of things that are compressing margins slightly in 2015. We have a slightly unfavorable mix shift in green production between large cabin and mid cabin. We are keeping large cabin production about the same rate as we did last year, at about 115 units. We are increasing mid-cabin by 10 units. And so there is a somewhat unfavorable mix shift between large and mid-sized green. It’s got less of a contribution at Jet primarily and exclusively driven by mix shift. We’ve got higher R&D in this upcoming year. Remember that we are building multiple test aircraft to carry with them no revenue and earnings.  And in the final – the final issue that’s impacting margins somewhat in 2015 is we have higher pre-owned. So those are the four components that are driving the margin variability.
Cai von Rumohr : But the R&D, I mean, is that up as a percent of sales because -- is the G650 still improving in profitability or is the profitability declining on the 450 and 550?
Phebe Novakovic: No, so that’s a kind of two-part question. Net R&D is up slightly. The 650 profitability continues to increase. And the 450 and 550 profitability being exactly where it has been, we have a greater mix shift this year – of mid-cabin which carries with it lower earnings – lower margins. I think you need to think about it that way.  We’ve talked before about the variability of margins at GulfStream, and this is an example of it. There’s nothing unexpected from our point of view. There is nothing systemic. It’s just simply the ebb and flow of production, R&D and pre-owned. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton : You mentioned that all of the large cabin programs had book to bill above 1. And the question is really two fold. One is where are the demands you are seeing the biggest part of the strength and whether you are seeing any dilution of strength in the oil-rich countries or Russia in particular? And the other piece of it is, is 2015 a year where you are delivering more G650s than the 450 and 550s in the mix?
Phebe Novakovic: So let me talk a little bit about demand and give you a little bit of color there. The demand for our in product – in production airplanes was quite handsome for the last quarter. The 650 and 280s increased, and interestingly but not surprisingly, when we got inside the demand curve for the 650 inside the 3-year delivery window, Q4 orders were particularly strong. 280 was again strong. The 450 and 550 demand has slowed slightly; it’s okay. Not super heated but good enough. And we continue to see strong demand primarily in North America and somewhat in Asia and also in the Mid-East. Heretofore we have seen no impact on oil prices on our backlog, or frankly in our demand.  If you are asking what percentage of our backlog may have some exposure to energy related or have some energy related exposures, it’s about 5% but we haven’t seen any impact yet. I would add, we are seeing historically low operating cost which is -- usually drive increased flight hours, and that’s a potential upside for our service business. So we tend not to give you delivery with any more specificity than we already have with respect to models, when you break it up by large cabin and mid cabin. And I don’t intend to change that in a moment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Harned : Hi, I wanted to just follow up on that. On the G450 – excuse me, on the G550, when you look forward here, where are you today in terms of months of backlog, something that you’ve given us in the past, and how are you thinking about pricing as you approach the G500 and G600 coming into operation?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So I think you know that we don’t talk about pricing, that’s competitively sensitive. But let me give you a sense of where we are and first available. In general, for new customers, for the G650 and G650ER first available is fourth quarter 2017, that moved to the right a quarter from third quarter of last year as a result of our good order activity. The G550 is about 12 months out, the G450 late this year, so that moved a couple of months – a few months into the left. The G280 is also available – first available late this year and not that anybody asked, but the G150 is first quarter 2016. So it’s important to recall that deals are often in the works that move customers around in the backlog for earlier squad [ph] but the above is about approximate window for new buyers. So I hope that helps you.
Doug Harned : And you can’t really comment on the trajectory on pricing with the model change I guess, is that – 
Phebe Novakovic: No, look, we have continued to hold price on products and you could expect that over time there is some price variability but we are not about to get into any specifics. That’s just not good a competitive place to be in a highly competitive market. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard : Phebe, on IS&T you’ve guided down 5.5% for this year. Can you give us an idea of how much of that is already in the backlog and sort of level of conservatism you might have based into that given the fluctuating situation with the DoD budget?
Phebe Novakovic: Given the what situation?
Robert Stallard : Fluctuating?
Phebe Novakovic: So we have about three quarters of our guidance for IS&T in our backlog. That’s exactly where we have been historically including recently. We’ve got good – we’ve got a high level of RFP – request for proposal activity and are bidding on a number of contracts. So we are pretty comfortable that we can hit our revenue guidance. And from our point of view, we’ve seen less fluctuation in the DoD budget with respect to our IS&T units recently than we had a couple of years ago. So we think that, that’s somewhat stabilized and as I told you, we anticipated 2014 would be our low watermark – it was better than we thought it was going to be, and I think some of that decrease bled into 2015. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. 
Sam Pearlstein : Hi. Can you talk I guess – I am going to try and put two things in there – but first on marine, I am somewhat that you are not seeing more margin pressure given what I would think would be more Bloc IV work and more Ohio replacement work in the year just in terms of the mix, so I guess what are you doing to offset that? And then just related to combat, you talked about growth resuming in 2016. Is this a business that we should now expect to see kind of growth in this still 15% kind of margin runway far into the future?
Phebe Novakovic: Let me address your questions in the order that they were asked. We’ve talked frequently about margin variability at the marine group. There is really a mix shift and you quite accurately point out that we are experiencing a mix shift really frankly across our portfolio, more Block IV, less Block III, more commercial work coming off of the MLP program and first of class ships on the DDG1000 and DDG51 restart. That said, these businesses have continued to perform very very well on cost cutting, efficiency and their performance have been quite good, and I frankly expect to see margin expansion which is primarily driven by Block IV, we have increased margin potential and earnings potential from our profitability and efficiency as we move down our learning curve. So marine group continues to function very very well and I like their growth story.  Combat systems growth, we have that significant backlog and now for us it’s all a question of performing on that backlog and I think this group has demonstrated its operational excellence and will continue to do so. So I expect – I have given you my guidance for 2015 but as I project out into the future and think about the business, it’s just going to be – we are going to see some growth in combat and I would expect to fully anticipate given the operational excellence of this group to see margin expansion but I am not going to bake any of that in now, on some of these programs. We are still in fairly new starts and low rate production but everything we see, this is a group that will continue to cut costs and improve its efficiency. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay : Phebe, can you talk a little bit about the variables that drive the decision to take up rate, as you look here across the global landscape, questions about global economic growth possibly decelerating particularly in emerging markets, a very strong US dollar right now that might be having an impact on some of your operating expenses. And sort of as that filters into potential cannibalization within the product lines, more of a G650 question anything else, but can you talk about maybe at a higher level for what factors you guys look at when deciding how to think about taking up production rates?
Phebe Novakovic: So we have historically and as we talked about before, we’ve historically set our production rates and we’ve continued that practice based on what we see in demand, and to optimize around our economic efficiency, our supplier base and we’ve been very judicious year over year in setting our production rates and deliveries. So as I mentioned, we continue to see a very strong demand, particularly for the 650 – as our pipeline on the 650 is very good, the 280 also. So we really haven’t seen much impact on emerging markets, certainly not this year. North America remains very strong with us, Asia Pacific and we are also seeing some increased demand in the Middle East. I would also tell you that about 60% of our backlog is with public and private companies including Fortune 500, they may tend to be very stable and reliable and predictable. And as I said our pipeline continues to show interest on their part. So I hope that kind of addressed it, if you look at a complex number of factors, what our demand is, what our goals are for our operating efficiency, our supply chain, we manage prudently. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne, Agee.
Peter Arment : Phebe, quick question on just the international demand, I know you gave us some good color on GulfStream’s impact, particularly tied to the energy end markets. You won a lot of orders in terms of combat this past year. How are we thinking about the international demand first under the defense business, I think that you have, and any risk tied to see some of the lower price of oil on that?
Phebe Novakovic: The lower price of oil. I have been a big believer and I think history has demonstrated that demand for defense products is driven by threat and perceived threat, and you just have to open up the paper to see that the world isn’t increasingly unsafe place. So we see it in increased level of interest in parts of Europe and the Middle East, just as you might anticipate. Governments begin to rethink their spending priorities in light of some of the threats that they see both actualized and potential. So we have a pretty robust pipeline that’s continuing, in our IS&T unit and for combat now, I will tell you that the marine group has almost no and never had much international exposure. Just the nature of our Navy shipbuilding program. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro : I want to pursue the margin at GulfStream a little bit more. This quarter effectively you had 60% incrementals and if I add back the 40 million higher R&D and G&A, you would have had a 100% conversion. So can you tell me what was so strong this quarter that all of next year’s probably going to decline if your numbers are right to 15% kind of incremental margins? And also, you had no pre-owned this quarter, you had three for the year versus 11 in ’13. So why does ‘15 pre-owned go up?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, that’s a compound question, George. So let me see if I can at least address what I think the essence is. The same, having less pre-owned this year clearly wasn’t upper to our margins. Pre-owned tends to carry no revenue. And we forecast pre-owned demand based on what we see in our backlog and sometimes that comes to fruition and sometimes not. So this has been a pretty sustained pattern over time with respect to pre-owned, it tends to be lumpy and we won’t know until the quarter of execution whether in fact anticipated pre-owneds come into our market or they are sold before they get to GulfStream. So that makes pre-owned a little bit tougher to articulate. We had the performance at GulfStream this year was extremely strong and we had a favorable completion mix in the fourth quarter that we are reversing somewhat going into next year. So we’ve talked multiple times about the fallacy of being able to predict with great specificity the GulfStream or aerospace margins and I will tell you Jet had a very strong year this year. And that contribution will be less next year primarily driven by a mix shift as they move into the additional completion work and they come down their learning curve. So all of these factors are planned at GulfStream and aerospace margins. 
George Shapiro : Could you point to some unique things in the fourth quarter that caused such an extraordinarily high conversion that won’t repeat?
Phebe Novakovic: Well I think again gosh, George, I have tried, we’ve got less contribution from Jet and we had a favorable delivery mix on large cabin to mid cab and that’s a pretty – those are pretty big movers. So – and less pre-owned and that’s a big one. Pre-owned tends to carry very little with no or negative margins. So that in my mind explains. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies.
Howard Rubel : Rather than be too granular here, I wanted to take a step back. As you look at your outlook and what you’ve asked your senior executives to do, where – as you look at the various risks might you see either challenges or opportunities and I use two examples and then hopefully you can add to that. One is some of your operations have European or Canadian based costs and you sell in dollars, so there may be some upside there, although I know you had some. And then also you embarked on a very aggressive research and development campaign at GulfStream and how have you assessed the risks and where have you felt like you’ve made progress? So it’s a bit of specifics and then wrapped in a little bit of the 805 to 810 is a nice start for the year but I am sure we won’t end there.
Phebe Novakovic: So just to reiterate, we have given you guidance based on the same assumptions that we used last year, and our ability to do better is simply going to be as a result of share repurchases and outperforming our plan. If you look at our outlook, it’s informed by the last two years, where we focused on operations, reduced our costs and results, built our backlog. So we are poised for growth as a result of that backlog for several years to come. It’s a very nice position to be. We are going to see some good growth in ’16 and ’17 and the business is poised for that. We’ve been focusing on operations and what we basically call the back to basic which is blocking and tackling. That work is never done. So we’re going to continue to attack our costs through a relentless focus on our cost performance and re-engineering our business, that will make us more competitive, reduces our cost mix, more competitive and that two will help growth. So we have positioned ourselves nicely and I think we will continue to do so going forward.  Our opportunities are because of our improved competitiveness, increased growth primarily both overseas and we’ve talked about that before. We’ve got another opportunity as margin expansion going forward as we focus on our continuous improvement. We’ve got – when I think about risks, you implicitly asked about foreign currency risk. We are less exposed to foreign currency variability than companies in other sectors for example and 60% of our business is with the US government and GulfStream’s exposures to the US economy. We have – there’s some translation difficulty year over year with respect to currency fluctuations, we’ve embedded those in our plan. We also have some nice natural hedges both in Europe and in Canada. So has the strong dollar affected any of our demand? Not really. And we certainly haven’t seen it in our backlog. We had a translation we had to adjust our combat backlog as a result of a negative translation but that’s on work, that’s many years out. So but in terms of sales, we are not just seeing any particular impact. It’s a potential sure but not affecting us.  So – oh, you asked about R&D as a risk. So the key, when you introduce I think you invest in a business and a new product development. And you introduce new product, is that you have managed that R&D and the engineering and development and design effectively, and GulfStream has a proven history of doing that and we are continuing to see that same kind of excellent execution in our design and engineering effort at GulfStream. So we don’t see any risk outside what we have always seen in the past with respect to R&D but we manage R&D at GulfStream and their design and engineering activities very very closely and we’ve really – we set the expectations accordingly and we’ve got a great team there. It’s all about the execution and so far so good. So I hope that answers where you were ahead. 
Howard Rubel : No, I actually meant the currency because of where you are building things is actually an advantage either in Europe or in Canada, that was a – 
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, in some instances, it is but we haven’t seen either up, nor down any particular impact in the moment. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.
Joe Nadol : So I have a couple but they are easy. One, once more, just on the clarification, on the combat side, you are seeing flat, you had these big orders obviously in your backlog that were from international customers last year. Can you give us some help with how much you expect international if it’s a case to be up and then US down in 2015? And the second one is just more broadly speaking, looking at the whole company, can you speak a little bit, whatever you feel comfortable, about the bookings that you are expecting across the company this year? I am particularly interested is, are there any of these larger combat opportunities that are still out there that might hit kind of $1 billion plus opportunities? And then also particularly interested in the 500 and 600 and what the tempo you expect on bookings there might be?
Phebe Novakovic: Okay. Complex questions. But let me address them in the order in which you asked them. We are seeing stabilization in our US land forces exposure at combat systems, directly in line with our expectations. And so we don’t really see any at least surprises that we can see in the near term. International orders are or international sales this year are comprised about in excess of 55% of combat sales, and we will increase to 60 over time not at the expense of our domestic activity but just as a revenue expansion. So we do – we still have a lot of I’d say number of international orders in our pipeline that are of decent size, that is our – it is our expectation that given our competitiveness in our cost structure we are going to be having some competitive in the competition. So we have additional upside in building our backlog at combat but I am not prepared to give you any specifics on whether that makes it a book to bill of 1 to 1 in any one given year, that will depend on a lot of things on when these competitions are decided but we’ve got a lot of proposal activity out there. And with respect to 550 or 500 and 600 tempo, both of those R&D programs are proceeding at pace, and no major changes since the last time we talked to about it. Our pipeline is very robust and I expect sales to increase as we orders to increase as we get closer and closer to the entry into service as a 500 and then the 600. So there is no – there have been no stumbling blocks heretofore and our profiles on R&D and production of the test airplanes remain right on plan. So we are very pleased with that and we are pleased with the interest that both of these models have generated. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi.
Jason Gursky : Similar to Joe, one clarification question and then one, on the growth for combat systems out into ’16 and ’17, can you offer a little bit of more insight on the type of growth that you might be expecting there? And then if you wouldn’t mind, just driving down into IS&T, where are you seeing relative areas of strength in ’15 and weakness in ’15, just what’s the mix doing there?
Phebe Novakovic: I don’t want to get into specifics about ’16 and ’17 other than we are – at combat, other than we have the backlog and are poised for reasonable growth, growth that we will manage according to our terms and conditions of our contract and also our supply chain. So I would expect growth but not of a double digit nature. We don’t think it that way. We are not going to burn off that backlog that quickly. It’s not efficient and it’s not in accordance with the terms and conditions of our contracts.  The second part of your question – 
Jason Gursky : The mix at IS&T where you’re seeing – 
Phebe Novakovic: Mix in IS&T. So we have – as you know, over the last few years, our IT services business has composed a larger percentage of our revenues, that is somewhat changing as a percent of revenue. We, you may know, combined two of our non-IT businesses and AIS and C4 systems into mission systems. And over time there it is our anticipation that they will grow as a larger percentage of our IS&T sales than IT. But both of those businesses are poised very very well for – again no single digit growth but still growth and I would add that I am very pleased with their margin performance. It’s particularly interesting that’s a year that we had some revenue decline, considerable revenue decline, we outperformed on margins and this year we expect revenue decline and again higher margins and this time bring it with higher earnings than last year. So that’s a pretty wholesome story from my perspective.
Jason Gursky : Phebe, on that, just point of clarification, do you anticipate then at the end of 2015 to be kind of in a flat revenue environment year over year or creeping into a positive territory on IS&T?
Phebe Novakovic: We are projecting a positive territory, positive growth. In fact, with every single one of our businesses. 
Operator: Question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. 
Carter Copeland : Just I will stick to one and I want to switch gears and go back to the cash flow and capital deployment discussion. And the question is, is there an upper bound to how much balance sheet you might use to normalize your free cash flow deployment, should we think of this as whatever the gap to 100% conversion is, is what you use in the balance sheet or could it be more extensive than that? 
Phebe Novakovic: Every year we provided the same kind of guidance with respect to capital deployment and that is that, we at least in the two years and again this year, have anticipated deploying all of our free cash flow in share repurchases and dividends and we anticipate doing that again this year. But as with every other year, we give you the overall strategy and then the execution – the tactical execution comes during the course of the year. So think about in general terms that we will use our balance sheet to – and you quite I think accurately put it, normalize our cash flow for share repurchases. But I see no fundamental reason or a benefit from tapping into our balance sheet beyond that for share repurchases. Some of you have requested that we just – not necessarily you all but some out in the environment had requested that we go into our balance sheet early on and buy a significant number of shares. And I argued them and I will continue to argue now, I don’t think that’s judicious nor prudent, and I think that this year is a perfect example of why you don’t want to have expended all your bullets in prior years. Think about us as telling you what we are going to do at the beginning of the year and doing it and having very very reliable results and execution of our capital deployment in the year. So this year outlook very similar with respect to what our capital deployment intent is. Free cash flow and little bit or and some of the balance sheet depending again on where we are on free cash flow. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi of Stifel. 
Joe DeNardi : Phebe, maybe another one on the balance sheet, I appreciate your comments about not wanting to expend all of your bullets. But maybe longer term once the defense budget environment were to improve, would that change the way that you thought about using your balance sheet relative to some of your peers?
Phebe Novakovic: The way I think about the balance sheet is we have a strong balance sheet that gives us flexibility and agility and opportunity both in the year of execution and going forward. And I intend to preserve that flexibility and I intend to preserve the strength of that balance sheet with some variability in any given year, but not taken up cash off that balance sheet to change our overall firepower. So as I sit here today, that is our strategy and we will adapt accordingly in the future as circumstances may change. 
Joe DeNardi : And then in terms of the fourth quarter guidance, the big fourth quarter, is there any particular segment that’s especially lumpy, are you waiting for any big awards to come in later in the year to hit that guidance?
Phebe Novakovic: No. The quarterly distribution of EPS that I gave you in my remarks is typical of our performance that we tend to start out light, build throughout the year and have a strong fourth quarter. So that’s very consistent with that ebb and flow of our business.  End of Q&A

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tihisha and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Erin Linnihan, Director of IR, Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you Tihisha and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic:  Good morning. As you can observe from our earnings report, we enjoyed a particularly compelling quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.05 per fully diluted share on revenues of 7.75 billion, and income from continuing operations of 694 million, this is $0.21 per share better than the year ago quarter and $0.14 per share better than consensus. Revenue was up 60 million against the year ago quarter, operating earnings were up 38 million or 4%, and income from continuing operations was $42 million higher. Operating earnings of 999 million reflect 12.9% operating margins, a 50 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2013. Sequentially the news is much the same, revenue was up 277 million, 3.7%. Operating earnings were up 50 million on a 20 basis point improvement in operating margins and earnings from continuing operations were up 48 million. Finally, EPS was $0.17 better than last quarter. In short, we experienced the highest revenues so far this year, had the highest operating earnings in four years, the highest margins in six years, and the highest earnings from continuing operations on my watch. This led quite naturally to the strongest quarterly EPS we have ever had, all pretty powerful and the strong indication that our focus on operations is paying dividends. With respect to cash, we had 2.33 billion of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 330% of net income from continuing operations. We have 3.46 billion year-to-date, 179% of net income from continuing operations. However a word of caution here, some of this cash is from advanced payments on international orders and will be deployed in future quarter for pragmatic purposes and leans the balance sheet. That having been said, it was still a very powerful quarter from a cash perspective. With respect to share repurchases, in the quarter we repurchased slightly less than 3.8 million shares for approximately 468.5 million. We have purchased somewhat in excess of 28.8 million year-to-date for about 3.2 billion. We plan for modest share repurchase activity in the final quarter of the year with a resumption of increased activity early next year. As you can see from the backlog charts that we attached to the press release, this quarter is also a story of continuing growth in the backlog. Once again there was a substantial intake of orders resulting in significant increases to backlog. We ended the quarter with the total backlog at an all-time APEX of 74.4 billion up from 71.1 billion at the end of the last quarter. All of this growth occurred in Combat Systems Group largely the result of international orders. You may recall that at the end of the third quarter of 2013 Combat Systems had a backlog of almost 7.8 billion. It now stands at 21.6 billion, more than a three-fold increase. If we look back over the last year for the entire Company, you will see a similar story. Our backlog has grown from 47.8 billion a year ago to 74.4 billion today, from my perspective, pretty impressive. Looking forward towards the fourth quarter, we would expect the Aerospace Group to enjoy very strong order intake as the result of the introduction of the two new aircraft announced this month, along with a growing interest in existing products, impart precipitated by the new product announcements. In other words, customers can now choose between the near-term availability of G450 and G550 and no longer wait for new products, with different speeds, ranges and price points. The clarity of these options for customers is helping drive decision-making. Before I turn this cal over to Jason Aiken to give you some segment details, I will note that I was particularly pleased by the revenue and earnings growth of the Aerospace Group, the continued excellent margin performance of Combat Systems, the revenue growth in the Marine Group, and the steadily improving margins at IS&T. We’re not where we want to be at IS&T but we’re improving. Jason?
Jason Aiken:  Thank you, Phebe. As Phebe indicated, the quarter was marked by very strong operating results from each of our business groups. I’ll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenues, earnings and margins were all up from the year ago quarter, as well as for the first nine months of the year. The Group reported sales just shy of $2.3 billion up from the third quarter of 2013 by 6.4%. Operating earnings increased 11.4% over 2013 to $411 million, the highest level of quarterly earnings the Aerospace Group has ever seen. Operating margins were up 90 basis points to 18% on improved performance in G650 and G280 manufacturing and outfitting, as well as another good contribution from Jet Aviation. On a sequential basis, the Group experienced some margin compression from the first half consistent with our expectations. This is attributable to a variety of factors but primarily to the mix of aircraft deliveries and an increase in pre-owned aircraft activity. Of course the aircraft’s mix is more than just large versus mid cabin, keep in mind it includes the variety of models within those categories. Next, Combat Systems. Combat Systems revenues and operating earnings were also up compared with third quarter 2013. In the quarter, sales were up 6.8% to $1.4 billion, while earnings were up 1.8% to $232 million. Taking with the second quarter that was essentially flat year-over-year, it would appear that we found the bottom with respect to sales for the Group. As expected the Group’s margin rate while exceptionally strong was down from a year ago when the Group posted its highest margins in its history. In fact barring the third quarter of last year the Group’s margin this quarter were the highest they’ve ever been. So far this year the Combat Systems Group has experienced very strong performance with an operating margin rate of 14.4% year-to-date. When we look sequentially, revenues were down $70 million from the second quarter, but operating earnings and operating margins were both up, $12 million and 160 basis points respectively. This reflects the impact of the various restructuring actions taken in the past 18 months across the Group’s businesses, including a significant reduction in our European cost base and last year’s combination of two of our U.S.-based businesses. With the last of the European restructuring charges taken in the first quarter of this year, the Group’s margins have expanded significantly from the first quarter to the second, to the third. The cost reduction efforts position the Group well to execute on their strong backlog. Moving onto Marine Systems. The Marine Group’s revenues were higher than 2013 both in the third quarter and the first nine months. Revenues in the quarter were up by 7.2% to over $1.8 billion, while year-to-date revenues increased by 3.7% to nearly $5.3 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the Group’s submarine programs and commercial ship construction activities. The Group has started construction on the fourth block of Virginia-class submarines which was awarded in the second quarter and is continuing development activities on the Ohio-class submarine replacement program. Construction is also underway on the first three of 10 Jones Act ships under contract at our NASSCO shipyard. Operating earnings were steady compared with this point last year to $170 million and the Group’s operating margins were down 70 basis points in the quarter and 30 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift. The Group is transitioning from Block-3 to Block-4 of the Virginia-class program and from the Mobile Landing Platform program to the new commercial ship contracts at NASSCO. However, margins for the first nine months of the year remained very respectable 9.7%. And finally IS&T. You may recall that we had expected a 20% decline in revenues this year for IS&T, but based on the strength of the first half of the year we adjusted that expectation on last quarter’s call to a 15% decline. The Group continues to outperform our top-line expectation through nine months, with operating earnings following suite. Revenue of $2.25 billion in the quarter was off by about 13% compared to the prior year’s third quarter. And on the other hand, operating earnings declined just 6.5%, roughly half the decline in sales to $202 million. As a result, operating margins increased by 60 basis points to 9% in the quarter. This is the Group’s highest margin rate in the last three years, and marks the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion. All three of the Group’s businesses contributed to this improved performance in the quarter. The story for the first nine months is similar. Revenues were approximately $6.7 billion down only 11.7% versus the expected 15%. However, operating earnings were down only 4.3% resulting in 70 basis points of margin improvement. When we look sequentially, revenues and earnings were both up $84 million and $14 million respectively. And as I noted earlier, the Group has expanded margins sequentially since the fourth quarter of last year demonstrating good operating leverage and the Group’s ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business. On that front during the quarter, we announced the decision to combine Advanced Information Systems and C4 systems effective January 1, 2015. We expect this combination in resulting restructuring efforts to make the combined organization General Dynamics Mission Systems more efficient, profitable and responsive to our customers. I’d like to cover just a few miscellaneous financial items before I turn it back over to Phebe to wrap it up and begin the question-and-answer period. The net interest expense in the quarter was $21 million versus $22 million in the third quarter of 2013. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million. At the end of the quarter our balance sheet reflects a cash balance of $5.1 billion and the net cash position that’s cash and equivalence in excess of debt of $1.7 billion. In this regard you should reflect on the cautionary note Phebe introduced on this subject in her earlier comments. Our effective tax rate was 29.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected due to the resolution of some open matters related to our 2013 tax returns. For the full year now reflecting on our experience to-date in the tax rate of 29.8% for the first nine months, we now expect an effective tax rate around 30%. We funded our pension plans in the quarter as anticipated bringing our contributions through the first nine months to just over $500 million. And I’ll turn it back over now to Phebe to give you some wrap-up thoughts.
Phebe Novakovic: All right. As we turn to guidance, I will be brief. Somewhat higher revenue, higher than anticipated operating earnings and a modestly lower tax rate combined to permit us to increase our guidance for EPS from continuing operations to $7.60 to $7.70, approximately $0.25 up from our last discussion with you. Now, let’s get on to your questions. Erin?
Erin Linnihan: Thanks Phebe. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question, so that everyone has the chance to participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. Tihisha, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.
Question:
and:
Operator: No problem. (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please proceed.
Jason Gursky : Good morning everyone. Phebe I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about this backlog at Combat Systems and what it pertains for margins out in the future, would you just offer your view on how profitable that increased book of business might be and the sustainability of margins in Combat Systems?
 Citigroup: Good morning everyone. Phebe I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about this backlog at Combat Systems and what it pertains for margins out in the future, would you just offer your view on how profitable that increased book of business might be and the sustainability of margins in Combat Systems?
Phebe Novakovic: If we look into next year margins ought to look about the same as they do this year, because we really expect the ramp-ups in ’16 and ’17 and beyond. As we go through come down our learning curves, we’re going to improve our operating earnings and margins. These will be very profitable programs because they’re in our core we know how to produce them. And so we have strong expectations for Combat Systems’ margin performance.
Jason Gursky : Okay, great. And then at IS&T, can you talk a little bit about the contracting environment that’s going on there today? And whether you feel like things are getting markedly better, staying the same on the margin, getting a little worst just kind of contract terms as well as the cadence of bookings and the size of bookings?
 Citigroup: Okay, great. And then at IS&T, can you talk a little bit about the contracting environment that’s going on there today? And whether you feel like things are getting markedly better, staying the same on the margin, getting a little worst just kind of contract terms as well as the cadence of bookings and the size of bookings?
Phebe Novakovic: We’re not seeing much of a change in our contract terms and conditions. And still as a result for us margin expansion is all about performance. And we’ve seen some of that improved operating performance throughout that Group. Just give you an example we had a book-to-bill of one for the quarter in IS&T so nice order activity. And I really haven’t seen any material change in the contracting.
Jason Gursky : Okay, great. Thank you.
 Citigroup: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne, Agee. Please proceed.
Peter Arment : Thank you. Good morning Phebe. Just a question is on IS&T, you’ve talked about the combination here creating this Mission Systems business, and you just mentioned the contracting environment. Do you think this business ultimately can continue to see margin expansion or is there something structural that keeps it below 10% for the long-term?
 Sterne, Agee: Thank you. Good morning Phebe. Just a question is on IS&T, you’ve talked about the combination here creating this Mission Systems business, and you just mentioned the contracting environment. Do you think this business ultimately can continue to see margin expansion or is there something structural that keeps it below 10% for the long-term?
Phebe Novakovic: I see no reason why this business can’t get into the double-digits. We undertook this consolidation but the markets are changing so it was an opportune time for us to take a fresh look at our entire portfolio. And it became pretty clear to us that we were going to benefit from a consolidation. So from my perspective, the consolidation is going to result in additional cost savings going forward. So that is margin expansion opportunity.
Peter Arment : Okay, I’ll stick to the one. Thank you.
 Sterne, Agee: Okay, I’ll stick to the one. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Sam Pearlstein : Good morning. Phebe can you talk a little bit about the $0.25 improvement in terms of the guidance, in terms of where that’s changing, which are the different segments? Because I know, like as an example, IS&T, down 15%, is certainly down a lot less than that year-to-date so we’d imply a pretty weak fourth quarter unless there is some changes amongst those?
 Wells Fargo Securities: Good morning. Phebe can you talk a little bit about the $0.25 improvement in terms of the guidance, in terms of where that’s changing, which are the different segments? Because I know, like as an example, IS&T, down 15%, is certainly down a lot less than that year-to-date so we’d imply a pretty weak fourth quarter unless there is some changes amongst those?
Phebe Novakovic: No, I think our guidance reflects our year-to-date performance and the fourth quarter is going to look very much like what we are leading, we’re guiding to on the overall Company. So Marine will be a little bit up. And everybody -- all the other Groups are pretty much steady. There is some margin compression in IS&T but not much. So, I think when we’ve increased our guidance really to reflect where we’ve been and where we see going forward for the remainder of the year. So this is uncomfortable with our guidance.
Sam Pearlstein : But in terms at least for the four segments, did the outlook changed relative to what you talked about? I am trying to just understand where you’re moving that increase of $0.25 from?
 Wells Fargo Securities: But in terms at least for the four segments, did the outlook changed relative to what you talked about? I am trying to just understand where you’re moving that increase of $0.25 from?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, it’s really kind of across the board. We’ve got higher earnings and we anticipate higher earnings in Aerospace, higher earnings in the Marine Systems and well and higher earnings in Combat. So a little bit margin compression as I said in IS&T in the fourth quarter. But when you roll it all up where we’ve been and what we see for the fourth quarter 7.60 to 7.70 is we’re very comfortable with that.
Sam Pearlstein :   Okay. Thank you.
 Wells Fargo Securities:   Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.
Robert Stallard :  Thanks so much. Good morning. Just a couple of things on cash, and Phebe mentioned that the conversion rate would obviously be above average of the first nine months, where do you expect us to go in the future, are we going to get back to 100% or below that as you burn through these advances?
 Royal Bank of Canada:  Thanks so much. Good morning. Just a couple of things on cash, and Phebe mentioned that the conversion rate would obviously be above average of the first nine months, where do you expect us to go in the future, are we going to get back to 100% or below that as you burn through these advances?
Phebe Novakovic:  We’ll be at about at 100% as we begin to take that cash of the balance sheet and send it upon its way to our suppliers. So, we’ve target about 100%.
Robert Stallard : Okay. And…
 Royal Bank of Canada: Okay. And…
Phebe Novakovic: Still very good cash generation.
Robert Stallard : Yes, on the [buying] is there any reason why you are easing off in the fourth quarter?
 Royal Bank of Canada: Yes, on the [buying] is there any reason why you are easing off in the fourth quarter?
Phebe Novakovic: We’ve told you all and our investors that we would deploy all of, most if not all of our free cash flow to share repurchases and dividends and we’re about at that point. So, we’ll go a little bit slower in the fourth quarter, but I expect to pick that activity back up in the beginning of the year.
Robert Stallard : Great, thanks so much.
 Royal Bank of Canada: Great, thanks so much.
Operator:  Your next question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned :  Yes, good morning. When you talked earlier about the G500 and G600 and then the G450 and G550 and how this gives customers the opportunity for a lot of different decisions. But when you look forward on the 450 and the 550, what’s the level of backlog that in terms of months that you’re comfortable with to make sure that you can continue to keep production at the levels you’re at today until the 500 and 600 come out. I am just curious where you stand today in terms of that and how you get confidence that you’re going to be in a good position?
 Sanford Bernstein:  Yes, good morning. When you talked earlier about the G500 and G600 and then the G450 and G550 and how this gives customers the opportunity for a lot of different decisions. But when you look forward on the 450 and the 550, what’s the level of backlog that in terms of months that you’re comfortable with to make sure that you can continue to keep production at the levels you’re at today until the 500 and 600 come out. I am just curious where you stand today in terms of that and how you get confidence that you’re going to be in a good position?
Phebe Novakovic: Let me give you a little bit of color on that. In the quarter our backlog increased by a quarter for almost all of our models 650, 650/ER third quarter of ’17, 550 first quarter of ’16, 450 about the same, 280 third quarter of ’15 and the 150 frankly the largest increase at the first quarter of 2016. So that provides us pretty steady production rate as we go forward to plan for the next at least 12 month period. And you recall we set our production rates at the end of the prior year and then we’ll give you some details about those rates as we go forward. But it’s too soon to predict, I think it's just too soon to project when we have any material changes in productions as a result of the new airplane. And when we get to that, get closer to that point we’ll give you a little bit more clarity.
Doug Harned : So is it fair to say you are looking at having some flexibility there as you see how demand rolls out for each of the different models overtime?
 Sanford Bernstein: So is it fair to say you are looking at having some flexibility there as you see how demand rolls out for each of the different models overtime?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, we always have flexibility. I think that agility helps us keep our profitability high and as we balance resources against demand. So, I am comfortable that as we stand here today we’ve got an executable plan going forward and as I said as we get closer to the entry into service of the 500 and then the 600, we’ll give you a little bit more color on to, into the relative production rates.
Doug Harned : Okay, very good, thank you.
 Sanford Bernstein: Okay, very good, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please proceed.  
Joe Nadol :  Thanks. Good morning, good results. Phebe, just on Marine, the margins have come down a little bit the last couple of quarters and you have indicated that it’s transitioning on the multi-years for Virginia-class plus the MLP over to the new commercial ships. How are the ships coming, I mean this is your, this was your business before with your current position and so as you look at the early stages of the curves in the ships, how are they coming and where do you think the margins kind of bottom out before we start seeing an uptick as they mature?
 JPMorgan:  Thanks. Good morning, good results. Phebe, just on Marine, the margins have come down a little bit the last couple of quarters and you have indicated that it’s transitioning on the multi-years for Virginia-class plus the MLP over to the new commercial ships. How are the ships coming, I mean this is your, this was your business before with your current position and so as you look at the early stages of the curves in the ships, how are they coming and where do you think the margins kind of bottom out before we start seeing an uptick as they mature?
Phebe Novakovic: You pretty much got it right on the mix shift, we’ve got mix shift from Block-3 to Block-4 and then the transition from the MLP to the Jones Act ships. It's an interesting, when you think about what NASSCO has been able to do, they have demonstrated that they can build these ships and meet the customer’s needs competitively and profitably while they are continuing to deliver Navy ships. So the current work we have in-house at NASSCO provides us nice revenue and earnings for the foreseeable future. We’ve got three ships in production they are all performing on or above plan. So I would -- now one thing one caution here is that think about commercial ship building as providing nice strong earnings but the margin are going to be a touch lumpier as we move from one ship class to the next ship class because these are shorter cycles and maybe ship building. So I suspect we’ll see continued margin improvement at NASSCO and have elected photos as we work through some of these mix shifts. And I would suspect to see some of that next year and certainly going into ’16 and beyond.
Joe Nadol : Just to be specific, so, next year you expect to see margins start to perk up?
 JPMorgan: Just to be specific, so, next year you expect to see margins start to perk up?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, they ought to be, it ought to -- I expect we haven’t done our detailed planning yet but I anticipate that they will somewhat near this year.
Joe Nadol : Okay, thank you.
 JPMorgan: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thanks so much Phebe. So if you could give us maybe a little bit more color on Gulfstream, are the 650 margins kind of above, you said they’re above the 450. Where are they relative to the 550? And in terms of cash, when do you expect to get initial signed contracts for the G500 and what kind of impact is that going to have? That should have a positive impact on cash. Thanks.
 Cowen and Company: Yes, thanks so much Phebe. So if you could give us maybe a little bit more color on Gulfstream, are the 650 margins kind of above, you said they’re above the 450. Where are they relative to the 550? And in terms of cash, when do you expect to get initial signed contracts for the G500 and what kind of impact is that going to have? That should have a positive impact on cash. Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, so the 650, and 650/ER margins are beginning to approach the 550 and I suspect sometime next year we may have the crossing point on that. We haven’t yet planned out our cash in any detail with respect to the 500s and 600s. We expect to see some this year but more going into next year. And by the way, we’ll give you a lot of color in the fourth quarter call in January about the order activity on both of those airplanes.
Cai von Rumohr : Can you give us some additional color on that, on that order activity, or just the reception? And, whether you…
 Cowen and Company: Can you give us some additional color on that, on that order activity, or just the reception? And, whether you…
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So we announced at the rollout that we had several orders, large orders. And the order activity has been very positive since then. But I don’t really want to give you a battlefield update and we’re just barely end of this quarter. So we’ll be able to give you some confirm color and details in the fourth quarter call.
Cai von Rumohr : Okay, thank you.
 Cowen and Company: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Hunter Keay : Thank you very much. Phebe, can you give us a couple of updates on a couple of ground vehicle programs, I think we are in a bit of a state of flux for you guys; one is AMPV and the other is JLTV. On JLTV, could you confirm, have you guys excluded yourself from bidding on the LRIP contract next year? Are you officially going to, are you officially out of that program at this point? And on…
 Wolfe Research: Thank you very much. Phebe, can you give us a couple of updates on a couple of ground vehicle programs, I think we are in a bit of a state of flux for you guys; one is AMPV and the other is JLTV. On JLTV, could you confirm, have you guys excluded yourself from bidding on the LRIP contract next year? Are you officially going to, are you officially out of that program at this point? And on…
Phebe Novakovic: Yes.
Hunter Keay : Yes, I was going to also ask on AMPV. So if you give me an update on that, that’d be great. Thank you.
 Wolfe Research: Yes, I was going to also ask on AMPV. So if you give me an update on that, that’d be great. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, we haven’t played in the JLTV market and on AMPV. We’re continuing to work with our customer on options for where our vehicles may make some sense. But our mature programs and our tanks and strikers are doing exactly what we thought they did would do and very good margin performance and good earnings. So, we have a lot of stability on those as of today on our Ground Systems’ domestic markets.
Hunter Keay : Okay, and just one quick follow-up. I missed it. How long was the wait for G650 right now? Thank you.
 Wolfe Research: Okay, and just one quick follow-up. I missed it. How long was the wait for G650 right now? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic: It is just for 650 the third quarter of ’17.
Hunter Keay : Thank you.
 Wolfe Research: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn : Good morning. Phebe I was going to ask for some more help on Aerospace backlog, and just reconciling the book-to-bill with the extension of the backlogs for the models you talked about earlier. I suspect a lot of what’s happening is you’ve been working off a very strong 650 bookings back in 2011. So there is distortion. Is there a point at which we start to get current on bookings and deliveries’ orders, the introduction of these two new aircraft create new distortion in the next couple of quarters as these orders come in?
 Credit Suisse: Good morning. Phebe I was going to ask for some more help on Aerospace backlog, and just reconciling the book-to-bill with the extension of the backlogs for the models you talked about earlier. I suspect a lot of what’s happening is you’ve been working off a very strong 650 bookings back in 2011. So there is distortion. Is there a point at which we start to get current on bookings and deliveries’ orders, the introduction of these two new aircraft create new distortion in the next couple of quarters as these orders come in?
Phebe Novakovic: So, you would aptly and correctly pointed out the, for the 650 order book. And given the length of time between order today and a delivery of that aircraft, is has some distortion in our book-to-bill. And we’ve talked about that I think for the last five or six quarters. As we move into the new airplane orders, we expect something very similar. So, I think that we used to watch book-to-bill with great, in the Aerospace Group, with great, I wouldn’t say consternation but detail. And I think that’s what’s apt now. So what we watch for is the mix of the airplanes and so far our in-service models are doing very-very well.
Robert Spingarn :   Okay. And then just switching topics a quick one if I could on a potential additional striker bridge, could you talk about any upside there in timing?
 Credit Suisse:   Okay. And then just switching topics a quick one if I could on a potential additional striker bridge, could you talk about any upside there in timing?
Phebe Novakovic:  That kind of depends on when we get an appropriations bill passed. As we’ve got money in 2015 appropriations for the striker bridge, the customer is very anxious to get those vehicles. So, it was pretty much inline of what we planned for in ’15 and ’16. But as I said we don’t have our detailed plans done, but there were no surprises.
Phebe Novakovic:   Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Your next question will come from the line of John Gordon from General Dynamics. Please proceed.  
John Gordon :  It's John Gordon from Morgan Stanley, but thank you for taking my question.
 Morgan Stanley:  It's John Gordon from Morgan Stanley, but thank you for taking my question.
Phebe Novakovic: So you got a battlefield promotion here.
John Gordon : That is right, Phebe, I wanted to follow-up on Aerospace margins a bit. When I think about sort of the progression throughout the year, I think it's safe to say that they have exceeded expectations. Earlier in the year you had highlighted a number of puts and takes, so when we think about your full year guidance now it seems like those aren’t I guess the downside risk isn’t coming to, I was hoping if you could just kind of give us a bit of color and maybe a play-by-play on what exactly drove the beats versus earlier concerns in the year and what that means as we look out into 2015 at risks and opportunities to improve margins from here?
 Morgan Stanley: That is right, Phebe, I wanted to follow-up on Aerospace margins a bit. When I think about sort of the progression throughout the year, I think it's safe to say that they have exceeded expectations. Earlier in the year you had highlighted a number of puts and takes, so when we think about your full year guidance now it seems like those aren’t I guess the downside risk isn’t coming to, I was hoping if you could just kind of give us a bit of color and maybe a play-by-play on what exactly drove the beats versus earlier concerns in the year and what that means as we look out into 2015 at risks and opportunities to improve margins from here?
Phebe Novakovic: So, the single largest factor particularly for this quarter in margins was pre-owned and we’ve talked I think for the last couple of quarters about with a business of this level of complexity there are a lot of puts and takes, aircraft mix, the mix of service both in terms of volume and types of service, what, some service jobs come in with a lot more high content work, R&D is lumpy, G&A can be lumpy, the pre-owned in this quarter was significant and we didn’t have much pre-owned in the first couple of quarters of this in fact zero in the first half of this year and we had three this quarter. So that is sort of I think well that is what affected our margins this year or this quarter. And then for the fourth quarter we’re looking for a pretty much the same, unless some margin compression but not a whole lot, again we anticipate a couple of pre-owned that carry no margin with it. Going forward, we believe that we’re going to see some margin expansions particularly as the 650 comes down its learning curve or not done improvement from the 650 in fact and production in fact are never really done. And then in the out years when we start to ramp-up 550 or 500 and 600 production we’ll see some compression in margin as we come down our learning curves. But again nothing that is remarkable or particularly out there.
John Gordon : Got it, thanks.
 Morgan Stanley: Got it, thanks.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Myles Walton :  Maybe first a clarification, the cash conversion that you expect in the fourth quarter and then usually it's seasonally strong you just don’t know how much of an influence this pull forward will have and if you’ll extend supplier’s cash here from the events in the fourth quarter. But the real question Phebe is given the breadth of growth in the defense backlogs I mean it seems like you would in a place to I don’t want to say declare a bottom for your defense business, but certainly look toward a potential for growth in 2015 is that across the defense portfolio in aggregate, is that an accurate statement?
 Deutsche Bank:  Maybe first a clarification, the cash conversion that you expect in the fourth quarter and then usually it's seasonally strong you just don’t know how much of an influence this pull forward will have and if you’ll extend supplier’s cash here from the events in the fourth quarter. But the real question Phebe is given the breadth of growth in the defense backlogs I mean it seems like you would in a place to I don’t want to say declare a bottom for your defense business, but certainly look toward a potential for growth in 2015 is that across the defense portfolio in aggregate, is that an accurate statement?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, let me talk about growth and let’s go by Groups in the Marine Group you ought to see steady low single-digit growth year-over-year and we’ve been predicting that and that’s in fact what has happened. Combat Systems given the considerable backlog it has when we start ramping up production and that is largely going to be in’16 and ’17, and I think you’re going to see good bottom-line and top-line growth. And IS&T, we believe we’re at the bottom and we do at least had a good order book in this last quarter. So, we see some good potential there. So on cash conversion thus far fourth quarter will be lighter obviously because we’re beginning to disperse some of that cash to our suppliers.
Myles Walton : Will it be positive free cash flow?
 Deutsche Bank: Will it be positive free cash flow?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes.
Myles Walton : Okay. Thanks.
 Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thanks.
Operator:  Your next question will come from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
George Shapiro :   Yes, good morning. Phebe I wanted to explore a little bit the Aerospace margins in a different way. And if you just look at the incremental margin, this quarter it was 31%. The second quarter you couldn’t calculate because the margin was up on down revenues. And the first quarter was also close to 30%. So I know you’ll say there is a lot of moving parts in everything in there. But it does seem like the incrementals still come out to around 30%. Now, is there any reason why that shouldn’t continue as we going forward? And then also if you could just update us on what your expected large cabin deliveries are for the year, if that’s changed any from the second quarter?
 Shapiro Research:   Yes, good morning. Phebe I wanted to explore a little bit the Aerospace margins in a different way. And if you just look at the incremental margin, this quarter it was 31%. The second quarter you couldn’t calculate because the margin was up on down revenues. And the first quarter was also close to 30%.

Now, is there any reason why that shouldn’t continue as we going forward? And then also if you could just update us on what your expected large cabin deliveries are for the year, if that’s changed any from the second quarter?
Phebe Novakovic: No, we’re at 116 large cabin and 32 mid cabin and that’s on green deliveries.
George Shapiro : Okay.
 Shapiro Research: Okay.
Phebe Novakovic: And basically the same for completions, so, look margins are going to be, and I think you’ve seen, they are somewhat lumpy. They will -- earnings are going to follow revenue growth. But we will have lumpy margins for a whole series of reasons that we’ve talked about at some length. R&D will fluctuate, net R&D will fluctuate, G&A will fluctuate, mix is going to fluctuate, pre-owned. It’s a complex business with a lot of moving parts that you’ve got a lot of puts and takes, right.
George Shapiro : Right, and that’s why to me it’s still surprising that when you look at the incremental margins. They don’t seem to vary all that much. It seems to be up around that 30% level.
 Shapiro Research: Right, and that’s why to me it’s still surprising that when you look at the incremental margins. They don’t seem to vary all that much. It seems to be up around that 30% level.
Phebe Novakovic: Well, our performance continues to pay if it’s just that you’ve got in any given quarter there are things that are affecting it and activities that are affecting it. So we have on our gross margins on our airplanes continue to be very-very strong and we see improvement across the board, quarter-over-quarter. So, go ahead…
George Shapiro : Okay, but -- one quick one maybe for Jason. How much were the revenues in the quarter associated with the three pre-owned aircraft?
 Shapiro Research: Okay, but -- one quick one maybe for Jason. How much were the revenues in the quarter associated with the three pre-owned aircraft?
Jason Aiken: Yes, one second. That…
Phebe Novakovic: I think it’s over 100 million.
Jason Aiken: Yes, it’s -- it’s actually closer to about 70 million, or so.
George Shapiro : Okay, thanks very much Phebe and good performance.
 Shapiro Research: Okay, thanks very much Phebe and good performance.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.
Pete Skibitski : Good morning guys, nice quarter. And Phebe I was just wondering if you could give us some color on what’s going on with Russia and China with the sanction, but I think the corruption crackdown in China. Are any of those issues particularly the sanctions holding up any Gulfstream deliveries? And overall for both countries, are you seeing any orders being deferred or just slowing in general because of what’s going on in those regions?
 Drexel Hamilton: Good morning guys, nice quarter. And Phebe I was just wondering if you could give us some color on what’s going on with Russia and China with the sanction, but I think the corruption crackdown in China. Are any of those issues particularly the sanctions holding up any Gulfstream deliveries? And overall for both countries, are you seeing any orders being deferred or just slowing in general because of what’s going on in those regions?
Phebe Novakovic: Not yet. The sanctions have only impacted us at very-very far margin, and more at Jet Aviation than in Gulfstream. And China, China has a history of variability in its order activity. So, I don’t see anything abnormal there.
Pete Skibitski : Okay, got it. And then just you touched on pre-owned market a little bit. Can you talk about the pricing that pre-owned market maybe by mid cabins and large cabins? Is it fairly stable year-over-year, not really improving? Or can you shed some color there?
 Drexel Hamilton: Okay, got it. And then just you touched on pre-owned market a little bit. Can you talk about the pricing that pre-owned market maybe by mid cabins and large cabins? Is it fairly stable year-over-year, not really improving? Or can you shed some color there?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes, it’s stable. And we’re seeing some improvements, particularly in the larger cabins. Price is affirming up in the pre-owned.
Pete Skibitski : Thank you.
 Drexel Hamilton: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel : Thank you very much. Phebe it seems as if you’re continuing to go through the businesses and find opportunities for either sell things or reposition them. And obviously you’ve done one in Combat and then you have a small sale to MDA. Could you elaborate a little bit on some of the longer term objectives that you’re looking for, for each of the businesses? I mean, you’ve sort hinted at some of them and in the earlier questions. Could you provide a little granularity please?
 Jefferies: Thank you very much. Phebe it seems as if you’re continuing to go through the businesses and find opportunities for either sell things or reposition them. And obviously you’ve done one in Combat and then you have a small sale to MDA. Could you elaborate a little bit on some of the longer term objectives that you’re looking for, for each of the businesses? I mean, you’ve sort hinted at some of them and in the earlier questions. Could you provide a little granularity please?
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So, in the case of Combat Systems, and by the way all of our internal reorganizations have been in response to changes in our market. So, as we looked at last year, our ATP and OTS business, it made eminent sense to go ahead and combine those two. Primarily some for scale but primarily to our cost reduction and that has executed beautifully. So, we’ve got nice-nice margin activity at now the new OTS. The IS&T was something we’ve thought about for a while. But again as our markets have contracted, it made sense now to integrate those two businesses primarily again for cost reductions. And we ought to see that, the margin benefit from that starting next year and going into the future. But also it provides us some scale which is helpful too in this down market. Look what we want to do in the down market is manage what you can manage and keep our margins as high as possible. So, we’ve had a long road of recovery on IS&T margins, but I anticipate that they will continue to improve.
Howard Rubel : And then just I don’t know, you said the other thing that you’ve done is you currently took work in-house for Gulfstream and you've hinted at some exciting manufacturing changes, could you just elaborate a little bit more on what you’ve done there to sort of take productivity and to a new level and what does that sort of imply for, what you are sort of setting a standard for other parts of the organization to look at these options?
 Jefferies: And then just I don’t know, you said the other thing that you’ve done is you currently took work in-house for Gulfstream and you've hinted at some exciting manufacturing changes, could you just elaborate a little bit more on what you’ve done there to sort of take productivity and to a new level and what does that sort of imply for, what you are sort of setting a standard for other parts of the organization to look at these options?
Phebe Novakovic: Well, it’s an interesting question now let’s go to the, what we have done in anticipation of the new airplane. We learned a very important lesson with the 650 that a purpose build facility provides much greater margin expansion overtime, that plus the way these airplanes were designed if they were designed for producibility. So fewer parts and cleaner and clear build paper, work paper that get’s out on the shop floor, so given that we have these purpose build facilities and the way these planes were manufactured or designed, I think we’ve got very-very good earnings potential in the future. We’ve taken some work in-house that we previously had outsourced so largely just as a matter of control and efficiency for some of these parts that we are now manufacturing at Gulfstream, the transportation costs are significantly less when you move it from one building right over to the next building. So that was a factor and how we thought about optimizing earnings potential going forward for these new airplanes. I don’t believe that this is necessarily a model for the defense businesses, not something that they look at. The Marine Group is not a vertically integrated Group neither is our Land Systems. So they have a very robust and disciplined supply chain network and I don’t see them bringing more work in-house.
Howard Rubel : Thank you very much.
 Jefferies: Thank you very much.
Operator:  Your next question will come from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Please proceed.
David Strauss :  Good morning. Phebe where are you in the process of selling AxleTech?
 UBS:  Good morning. Phebe where are you in the process of selling AxleTech?
Phebe Novakovic: As you know we moved AxleTech into discontinued operations and we are selling at and I think it’s not appropriate to comment any further than that.
David Strauss : Okay. As a follow-up Jason, on the pension legislation half the legislation I know you guys deal with cash differently than everyone else, but how does that impact you from a mandatory contribution standpoint going forward does that help you?
 UBS: Okay. As a follow-up Jason, on the pension legislation half the legislation I know you guys deal with cash differently than everyone else, but how does that impact you from a mandatory contribution standpoint going forward does that help you?
Jason Aiken:  It does, I think like just about everybody else it brings down pretty meaningfully the mandatory contributions that we’re projecting. That said, I think as you are aware of those contributions that we had in the past and are forecasting aren’t necessarily potentially as significant to us as it maybe to others. So the reduction isn’t something that we material, focused on as a material item that will change our cash flow outlook or anything else like that in a significant way.
David Strauss : Okay, great. Thank you.
 UBS: Okay, great. Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic:  Tihisha, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator:
 :
Carter Copeland :  Good morning, Phebe, Jason and Erin and good quarter. Just a couple of quick clarifications, Jason you said that the contribution from Jet was good in the quarter, I wondered if you could characterize whether that was better than what you have seen in maybe the past couple of quarters? And then with respect to the Mission Systems’ creation, I wondered if there were any restructuring or other expenses associated with the combination that are non-repeating for next year and if you could help us think about what that might contribute to next year’s margin? Thank you very much.
 Barclays Capital:  Good morning, Phebe, Jason and Erin and good quarter. Just a couple of quick clarifications, Jason you said that the contribution from Jet was good in the quarter, I wondered if you could characterize whether that was better than what you have seen in maybe the past couple of quarters? And then with respect to the Mission Systems’ creation, I wondered if there were any restructuring or other expenses associated with the combination that are non-repeating for next year and if you could help us think about what that might contribute to next year’s margin? Thank you very much.
Jason Aiken: I think with respect to the Jet Aviation question, we continue to see steady improvement in the business and year-over-year each quarter we’re seeing improvement, second quarter to second, third quarter to third and so on. So we expect to continue to see that slowly and steadily improve in our operations.
Phebe Novakovic: Any charges with respect to restructuring will be taken in the quarter in which they are incurred and more than offset by the cost saving. So we don’t see any material headwinds as a result.
Carter Copeland : Okay, great. Thanks for the color.
 Barclays Capital: Okay, great. Thanks for the color.
Erin Linnihan:  Thank you for joining our call today. If you have any additional questions I can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator:  Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the second quarter 2014 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Glen and I will be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions).   I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Erin Linnihan. Please proceed.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you Glen and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' second quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe Novakovic: Good morning. I’m pleased to report that we had a very strong quarter at General Dynamics with revenues of 7.47 billion, an income from continuing operations of 646 million. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $1.88 per diluted share, $0.07 ahead of the year ago quarter and $0.11 per share better than consensus. While revenue was 360 million lower, 4.6% than the year ago quarter income from continuing operations was 6 million higher on the strength of 12.7 operating margins, a 40 basis point improvement. Sequentially revenue was up 209 million in earnings from continuing operations were up 50 million on a 70 basis improvement in operating margins. You will note in this quarter that we took a 105 million after tax charge and discontinued operations for the planned sale of our axle business.   Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2014, revenues were down modestly 2.7% against 2013 however earnings from continuing operations were up over 2.6% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.17 or 5%. In short we’re off to a good start ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations leading to an improved outlook for the year. With respect to cash we had 791 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter about a 122% of net income from continuing operations. We had 1.132 billion for the first half, 91% of income from continuing operations and we fully expect a very strong third quarter. With respect to share repurchases in the quarter we repurchased slightly less than 10.7 million shares for approximately 1.2 billion. We have purchased somewhat in excess of 25 million shares in the first half however do not expect share repurchase activity at this level in the second half of the year. We have frontend loaded the share repurchase program, we will in the market but at a more moderate pace. An important part of the story in the quarter and for that matter in the previous quarter as well with the substantial intake of orders resulting in significant increases to backlog. We ended the quarter with the total backlog of 71.1 billion up from 55.9 billion at the end of the last quarter. Most of the growth occurred in the Marine Group, with the award of the Block-4 of the Virginia Class submarines. The IS&T Group also enjoyed a $468 million increase in total backlog. You may recall that the story in the first quarter was the tremendous growth in backlog and combat systems. In short the company’s the backlog and total potential contract value is at it's highest point in the last four years. This provides a solid bedrock upon which growth will be built. Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and the for the half. I will then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and give you our updated EPS guidance for 2014. First Aerospace, Aerospace had a good quarter with modestly lower revenue 2.8% on mix shift. Timing of deliveries and absence of preowned sales. However stronger than anticipated margins at 19.2%, 30 basis points better than the year ago quarter kept operating earnings down only 5 million or 1.3%. Let me provide you with some complexion on the quarter. Gulfstream enjoyed continued improvement in 650 green manufacturing and completion margin that more than offset continued mix shift. Jet Aviation again made a good contribution with double digit operating margins. For the first half of 2014 Aerospace revenues were up 289 million or 7.5%, operating earnings were up 89 million, 12.7% a further manifestation of Jet Aviation’s contribution and the continued performance improvement at Gulfstream. This is all reflected in a 90 basis improvement and operating margins for the first half of the year versus the first half of 2013, all-in-all a really superb first half with a very nice order take in the second quarter. There was particularly strong interest in the G550 in the quarter. Combat systems once again demonstrated disciplined performance reporting 15% margin on revenue only a half a percent less than a year ago resulting in modest increase in operating earnings over the year ago quarter. Our domestic businesses have particularly strong margin on cost reduction initiatives and program performance. ELS which had been impacted in the first quarter by additional restructuring charges returned to profitability with double-digit operating margins that we expect to improve on an accelerating basis through the remainder of the year. All-in-all a strong performance in a tough market environment. For the first half revenues are up 7.2% against the first half of 2013, operating earnings are down 16.5% principally as a result of the restructuring charge at ELS in Q1. However we expect operating earnings to be very strong in the second half. More in that subject when I provide guidance. Marine Group revenues were higher than in Q2, 2013 by 92 million, 5.2% but operating earnings and operating margins were down 2.2% and 70 basis points respectively entirely as a result of mix shift in the quarter. Nevertheless, both revenues and operating earnings were up nicely on a sequential basis. For the first half Marine Group revenues were up 67 million or 2% and operating earnings are up 3 million or 1% on slightly lower margins. Margins were still a very respectable 9.8 for the first half. IS&T, IS&T is the place where we expect tremendous revenues pressure for the year. You may recall that our initial guidance was a 20% decline in revenue year-over-year. Fortunately we’re doing somewhat better than expected. Revenue was off by 387 million or 15.2% compared to the prior year second quarter and also down somewhat sequentially. On the other hand operating earnings were down only 10 million or 5.1%, a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. The story for the first half is even better, revenues were down 553 million, 11.1% but operating earnings were down only 12 million, 3.1% on improved margins. This was very good operating leverage. Let me provide you some guidance for the year for each segment, compare this guidance to what we told you in January and then wrap it up with our EPS guidance for the year. For Aeroscape our guidance to you in January was to expect revenue of approximately 9 billion and operating margins around 17%. We now believe revenue will be offset that figure by about 250 million, the largest single driver of which is lower than anticipated preowned activity. On the other hand margins are expected to be about 18% for the year resulting in higher than anticipating operating earnings. The 18% margin guidance for the year implies some pressure on margins in the second half largely due to mix shift and increased R&D spending. For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenues to be off on unadjusted 2013 revenue by 4% to 4.5% with margins around 14%. We now expect revenue to off 2.8% from adjusted 2013 revenue or about 5.7 billion. Margins will be higher around 15% resulting in higher and predicted operating earnings. In Marine Systems we previously guided to revenue growth of 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range. We now expect revenue growth over 2013 a 4.5% and a margin rate of about 20 basis points better than previously forecast, once again resulting in higher operating earnings. For IS&T we previously guided to a revenue decline of 20% and a margin rate of 8.2%. It now appears that revenue will be down 15% and the margin rate should be about the same as our previous guidance, once again this will result in higher than previously expected operating earnings for the year. In summary all of this rolls into revenue for the year around 30.2 billion and operating margin of 12.5% and a return on sales from continuing operations of 8.5%. So higher than previously anticipated operating earnings, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count permit us to increase our EPS guidance for continuing operations between $7.40 and $7.45. The progression through the remainder of the year is -- of the third quarter will look a lot like the second with a very strong fourth quarter to finish. And now I would like to turn the mike over to Jason Aiken to give you additional detail.
Jason Aiken:  Thank you Phebe. Good morning. I will touch on just a few miscellaneous financial items before the question and answer period. As Phebe mentioned the results for the quarter include a charge of a $105 million in discontinued operations. In the quarter we engaged in the plan to sell the axle business in our Combat Systems Group. This action requires that we assess whether the price we expect to receive for this business is sufficient to cover the carrying value of it's net assets including an allocation of goodwill. This assessment resulted in the charge you see in the quarter in discontinued operations. The estimate will be trued up when the sale is completed which we expect to occur by the end of the year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $24 million versus $18 million in the second quarter of 2013. We had additional interest income in 2013 that reduced the net interest expense in that period and for 2014 we expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million. At the end of the quarter we’re in a net debt position that’s debt in excess of cash of $69 million. This reflects a $450 million swing from a net cash position in the prior quarter due to our activities on the capital deployment front which I will address just in a minute. As a reminder we have $500 million of notes maturing in January of next year and we will make a decision as we get closer to the end of this year as to whether to repay or refinance those notes. Our effective tax rate was 30.2% for the quarter slightly lower than expected as a result of higher international earnings which carry a lower tax rate. Based on our experience so far this year and the growing impact of international earnings we’re now expecting the full year effective tax rate to be at the low end of our previous guidance of 30.5% to 31%. We continue to expect cash contributions to our pension plans for 2014 to be around $550 million, as a reminder most of that funding is scheduled to occur in the third quarter of the year. With respect to capital deployment in the quarter we continued our commitment to deploy capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Phebe gave you the details of our share repurchases a few minutes ago and in total we expended almost $1.5 billion on share repurchases and dividend payments in the quarter. And over the past 18 months we returned over a 115% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. At the end of the second quarter we have $3.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet and are well-positioned to continue to execute our strategy and achieve the objectives that Phebe has articulated for 2014. Erin that concludes my remarks and I will turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan: Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you’ve additional questions please get back into the queue. Glen could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse:  I wanted to ask you Phebe on the Aerospace. You’ve done so well with the margins here and you’re guiding down a little bit on mix and R&D I think in the second half of the year but given that you’ve traditionally level loaded your R&D even if you should come out with a new program in the fall, might we expect that this guidance continues to be a bit conservative especially with continued improvement at Jet.
Phebe Novakovic: Let me walk you through that a bit, as you quite rightly point out we anticipate seeing some margin compression from mix shift and higher R&D and that’s net R&D because we do not anticipate the same level of launch assistance so that is -- we level it low at our R&D but launch assistance drives some variability. Say fewer jet contributions going forward. But I think it's a good opportunity to spend a moment on Aerospace margins a bit and to give you a little bit additional color on what drives the variability quarter-over-quarter in these lines of business. The fundamental principle that I think we have to keep in mind the underlying operating performance of each of these businesses is getting better quarter-over-quarter and if it weren’t I would tell you. So what does that mean? Well this means that there are other factors in these very complex businesses that impact margin, not one of which is necessarily material but in combination they can have some impact on a quarter-by-quarter basis. You know we have got mix shift between large cabin and mid cabin and service mix that mix. Also on volume by the way and it depends on the kind of service volume. The more complex service work, you get the higher margins you carry and for Gulf and this is true both at Gulfstream and Jet.  For Gulfstream as an OEM the more parts that they sell out of warranty, the higher the margin. So there is even within the inter-service business some various margin variability. With respect of Jet Aviation you get margins that are quarter-over-quarter, somewhat driven by where we’re in contracts. Think about Jet as a construction contract and what they do particularly with respect to completions. With newer contracts we start off with lower margin and then build as we come down our learning curve. So again that drive some variability. Sales expenses of both business has changed and as I noted launch assistance is lumpy and of course as you all well know preowned is almost always a zero margin business. So I think -- I thought it was worth just spending a little bit of time talking about why it is that we see some variability. I emphasize again though that the operating the fundamental operating performance remains improving quarter-over-quarter.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: I wanted to ask if also with the 650 are we at the point where that’s margin accretive and you mentioned better order flow there, obviously you’ve been sold out for long time. Is the order renewal or the -- what I would consider new momentum maybe it's not. Is this a function of a change in the end market or is it because the other guy is now probably fairly sold out so availability is no longer a differentiator.
Phebe Novakovic: Well availability is a differentiator to the extent that you actually have product. I think the way to think about, you had a couple of questions here but let me answer your last one first. I think the way to think about 650 demand is that we continue to see demand for that airplane, new demand and we have added not in large quantities as you would expect when there was a four year wait. But we have added almost every single quarter 650 orders. So that continues, there is a lot of interest in that business and by the way as we have worked through on that line of business in that airplane, as we work through the backlog we have accelerated the availability dates by about two quarters. So that’s a benefit to our customers as well.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: So that’s higher rate?
Phebe Novakovic : It's a higher rate and you would expect that as we have come down our learning curve and as we continue to move green airplanes through the manufacturing line and then into the completion centers. With respect to margins I believe that 650 margins, I believe that I told you -- I told the Street maybe last quarter that we have exceeded the 450 and are working our way up to the 550 but that’s probably several quarters away.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
David Strauss - UBS: Phebe on IS&T you did revise the revenue guidance off now down 15% but still calls for a pretty significant larger decline in the second half of the year, can you just talk about what’s driving that? And then on combat margins, it looks -- if I got it right, it's 15% margin guidance? It looks like it's implying a pretty big pick up in the back half of the year if you can just comment on that as well. Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic: Yes. So let me address your last question first, I told you all in the first quarter that combat margins was significantly and quickly recovered and they did and they were even more. I mentioned in my remarks that we took a $29 million restructuring charge in Q1 at ELS and with that behind and that business hits 10% margins this quarter and we expect them to continue to improve over the course of the year and both of our businesses continue their strong performance. So it's pretty much in-line with what we had anticipated. Going forward they are just doing better than we had thought and that’s why we’re raising our margin guidance for the year. With respect to sales on IS&T we had believed that the frontend would be, the first half of the year would be somewhat frontloaded and it does imply some sales slowdown in the second half and that’s consistent with what we had anticipated. We were pleased that the sales decline was less intense than we had thought and by the way that was across an entire spectrum of the businesses in both our IT business and Intel Business and coms business. So that was a nice sales performance in the first half and then some of the decline in sales that we anticipated that I think I told you guys before that this was -- we were risk adjusting our plan for army exposure and then that has happened but I would note that some of those we’re seeing indications that some of those lines of business are beginning to stabilize. For example in our tactical ISR comps, computing, modeling and simulation were all -- we took our decline but they are holding up pretty well. IT services worked for the army is also holding up nicely. What continues to be a weakness and a weakness that there isn't a whole lot that we can do anything about is in the sustainment and repair business. The army is taking all their work into the public depots [ph]. So as a result we’re doing almost nothing for the army in that line. So I think that addresses both of your questions.
Operator: Your next call comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research:  Two quick questions, mix was worse in Q2 than Q1 but the margin was a little higher in Q2 to -- versus Q1 in Aero. So I was just wondering what your explanation for that was and then the other one is I assume the book to bill would have been above one if I took out the fact that it was probably below one for the 650 and you are still expecting a 118 large deliveries for the year. Thanks.
Phebe Novakovic : I had a little trouble following the puts and takes on the first part of your question but let me address the orders because I think that’s kind of what you were getting at a little bit. We had a book to bill of about nine times and it was really a good, good strong order quarter for us. We had said that -- what we’re seeing is a lot of interest in the pipeline. It's just taking longer to close and so we have found that we have some variability in our order intake quarter-over-quarter and that’s what has happened. This quarter a lot of those orders came to fruition. So it was a nice quarter. By the way I have been tracking for you all the 450 and 550 which is where we look for these, where we would like to see in the moment. The order activity and once again for 450 and 550 they were 75% of the order book. The 280 was also strong. With respect to our green deliveries, we set a target every year that is right at the plan around how many green deliveries that we intend to have in the quarter or in the year and it's primarily driven by a host of factors. We have frequently taken it upon ourselves to sometimes rephase those deliveries. So you noted that we had slightly fewer deliveries in the second quarter than the first quarter but that we were -- we anticipate upticks in particularly the large cabin orders in the deliveries in the second half of the year. So all of that is meant to say that some of the timing -- some of the deliveries on green has been a question of timing and we have rephased that. So I think we’re looking at the moment which could change in about a 116 versus a 118 and again simply driven by timing. You would be surprised how frequently customers ask for flipping the green delivery or the completions delivery into the next quarter subsequent quarter or the subsequent year. So again it's nothing but timing.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research:  On the first quarter what I was getting at was you had 29 large and six mid-sized versus this quarter, 26 and seven. So I figured the mix was worse this quarter yet the margin this quarter was 19.2% versus 19% in the first quarter so you kind of overcame the mix maybe because of 650 productivity.
Phebe Novakovic: You got it. That’s it. Improvement on the 650 and also on the 280 but you got it, 650 did very well.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Okay so why won't that continue in the second half?
Phebe Novakovic : Well because of all the reasons I have just explained. We have got a mix shift among those three kinds of categories, large cabin, mid cabin and service and we have got higher R&D and Jet’s contribution while good, is going to be less. So those three factors are a compression on margins.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Could we shift to NASSCO, maybe tell us a little bit about the commercial ship building business, how it's doing and the prospect you’ve for new orders.
Phebe Novakovic:  For a number of years we talked about the impending return of the Jones Act market and it came and since that market has picked we have contracted for 10 Jones Act ship. It remains a very attractive market to us and the pipeline remains fairly robust and we’re in constantly communication and dialogue negotiations with potential customers. It's a good market, it's a price competitive market as you might imagine but I would note that this is not a place and not a market in which compete solely on price and are willing to use price as a differentiator, it's just too much risk in our profitability. So, we’re in the midst right now of ramping up a member of our new commercial orders and that has some -- you didn’t ask this question but it's implied, margin compression in the group but again that’s simply a question of moving from mature MLP and coming up the learning curve down the learning curve on commercial. So it's a nice market, it fills out NASSCO work flows very, very well. We have learned to build these ships efficiently. So I like it.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Given that basically you’re building essentially the same ship, should we expect the margins there to improve so this becomes a mix process as opposed to currently a mix negative?
Phebe Novakovic : Overtime absolutely but you would expect that from the shipyards, right?
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Yes, okay. And I mean --
Phebe Novakovic : By the way these are not exactly the same ship, so don’t think about it as a serial production on exactly the same specs. But there are differences but that said this yard will perform -- better and better performance as the programs mature.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Joe Nadol – JPMorgan: Phebe on the AxleTech divestiture, this is I think one of the first portfolio decisions you’ve made after -- you mentioned last year you were overhauling the M&A procedures internally. So I was wondering if you could comment on the process you went through in deciding to divest why you’re doing it and whether you’re looking at further divestitures, if this sort of opens the gates to lot of more portfolio activity.
Phebe Novakovic:  Sure. Just to give you a little bit of retrospective, AxleTech was for many years a very, very good business, as we were the merchant supplier for almost all of the variances of MRAP. We made a lot of money on that acquisition years ago. As the war wound down and the government decided not to initiate a program to repair or retrofit MRAPs the fundamentals of that axle market changed dramatically and now the -- what we see is think about it this way, a complete inversion of the demand curve on commercial with the demand curve of defense work. So that told us that and we believe by the way that’s a systemic change. So that told us that the value proposition really no longer obtained for us and that we believed and I still do that a commercial facing owner could be could be a better steward of the company. So I think you can expect us to respond as a market when we believe that there have been systemic changes and reacting according to our shareholders best interest. We have done a number of little pruning through like very small lines of business really limited in products just as again we changes in the market. But when we put together ATP and OTS we did a strategic analysis of every single one of our lines of business and what was core and where we thought that we could add value and this was one of those businesses that we felt could do better with a different parent and a different home. So I think you would expect us to react to our market. I don’t see any major divestitures on the horizon. We have tinkered within the IS&T portfolio but nothing that changes the nature of that portfolio. So these will be opportunistic as we proceed and make these decisions fairly deliberatively and we have a very disciplined process for executing the sales. So I think this was a wise move and it's good for all.
Joe Nadol – JPMorgan: Can you provide us with the expected level of proceeds from the divestiture?
Phebe Novakovic : Well not yet, everybody who is a perspective buyer would be listening. So, we will disclose how we do after we finish the transaction.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: You’re in a position at Gulfstream where you’ve got G650, a unique position in the market. You’ve said that the 550 has strong interest yet right now you’re at the lowest level of backlog in aerospace in one in five years and I’m just trying to understand how to fit that level of backlog with the program strengthens you’ve?
Phebe Novakovic : So Doug, I’ve tried to articulate this before. Think about our backlog as driven primarily by and predominantly by the 650 order book that we took in 5 or 6 years ago. That backlog provided for five or six years of sales activity on the 650. We’re drawing that down and I think that’s indicative as we would expect and totally wholesome and I believe that that’s an implied from the acceleration in the availability times by about two quarters which I just told -- we just discussed a few minutes ago. So we had a book to bill of 0.9. I don’t worry about the level of the backlog given the duration of that large program. I think it's very wholesome. There was nothing that we see in the order activity that causes us concern. Our pipeline is very robust, it's robust on the 650 as well. I think the customers and potential customers will be happy that they don’t have wait for quite such a long time for their airplanes. So I don’t worry about this. This is not some harbinger of a market issue at least with respect to us that I think we need to be worried about or our shareholders need to be worried about.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Well do you see a point here as you start to -- as you increase that availability take rate up. Should we expect the backlog to eventually turn up the other way as you start to increase rate or is this something where you see this kind of level as sort of the right level going forward?
Phebe Novakovic : Well look a lot of depend on a number of factors, all right? Including how we think about new airplanes that we may bring into the market. So you know the right level of backlog is the backlog that you can that sustains reasonable sales growth and allows us to continue to be a very profitable company and I think that we have got that now and I don’t see any sign that that’s going to be particularly troubling. I don’t have a target backlog. That ebbs and flows. The 650 was such a large order that you have to think about it more like some of the big ship orders. It was big and it was binary, that’s unusual in the business Jet Aviation market, right? So it is pervaded [ph] that backlog but if you look prior to the 650 announcement our backlog was pretty consistent driven by the economic environment and as we have added more airplane models we have increased that backlog and then the 650 just changed the nature of that backlog. So I think we have all gotten used to seeing it but it was an anomaly, because rarely do you ever see I don’t think ever has anybody ever seen that kind of big and binary change, more like the ships right?
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: I understand, it's just that when I look at the numbers today and you think of sort of backlog to revenues the numbers are actually even lower today than they were prior to the 650 launch in terms of that ratio. So I just wanted to understand if you saw an issue there but it sounds like you’re seeing things as pretty much where you want them to be in terms of demand.
Phebe Novakovic : Yes and absolutely and let me just also say that I think the entire industry right around the run-up to the great recession. The market was unhealthily overheated. I look to see -- I look at backlog to ensure that we have enough in our order book to sustain a growth in sales and a growth in profitability. I’m very comfortable where we’re now and I see no signs in our market that it's superheated or that we’re experienced any particular anomaly or something that we should be concerned. That’s why I have been reporting to you all where we look every quarter in our backlog as a 450-550 orders because you can’t add materially to the 650. That dynamic with respect to the 650 will change as we shorten the availability times, right?
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: That absolutely makes sense and certainly that’s one of the things that we have looked for is that you’ve this upward pressure to see when you can take those rates up and even get more availability.
Phebe Novakovic: And there you’ve it. But we’re not about pre-announce that, we make our rate decisions based on very disciplined analysis those of factoring a whole lot of independent variables right? So that’s within our I think in our to-do list, right?
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies: First I actually want to ask Jason a question, I figured you didn’t want him to be there or neglected and it looks like the way you bought back stock it was very much backend loaded when we look at the share count so that we should expect to fairly sharp decline sequentially in shares outstanding in the third quarter versus where you were in the second. Is that correct?
Jason Aiken: When you say at the end of the third quarter or is it at the end of the second quarter?
Howard Rubel - Jefferies: Excuse me, I apologize. It appears as if you have bought most of the shares towards the end of the second quarter because the difference between the weighted share count in the period and the share end number is fairly significant.
Jason Aiken: I wouldn’t necessarily go to that conclusion. The activity was spread right throughout the quarter and what you maybe seeing as the offsetting impact of stock option exercise activity and other factors that go into the weighted average calculation but no anomaly driving the share count or the repurchase activity towards the end of the quarter.
Phebe Novakovic:  We did an accelerated share repurchase in the first quarter but the second quarter was just steady eddy throughout the quarter.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies: And then second Phebe, you’ve focused a lot on making a difference cost as an effective competitive tool. Could you address a little bit of how that’s helped you either win some business or positioned you to win some business both at combat systems and at IS&T?
Phebe Novakovic: Absolutely. One of my favorite subjects. Let me give you the easiest and the most glaring frankly example. At ELS we had a cost structure going into 2013 that was so high it made them anti-competitive, just couldn’t win any orders. So we needed to get after that cost structure and we did it quickly, in a disciplined fashion. We did the same thing at GDUK and the results we’re seeing is in GDUK we actually had a C4 [ph] owns GDUK. We actually had a contract that we had been disqualified from because of high cost. We opened for us to go back into the competition because we had lowered our cost so dramatically and in a head to head competition with multiple other suppliers we won. I mean that is a simple and I think powerful example of what right sizing your business can do. It's a right thing to do for your shareholders, for your customer so that we can provide the services at competition rates and the same thing is happening in European Land Systems. So those were the two obvious examples but we’re seeing that throughout as C4 Systems has reduced it's business and restructured it's business dramatically since the fourth quarter of 2013. They have increased their order activity particularly in their overseas market, Canada and the Mid-East and to the extent that they are going in head to head competition. We have been doing very, very well in our capture rate. The same thing is true with our Intel business and the same thing is true with our IT business. So I’m very pleased with the performance of the company as we have focused getting back to the basics of operating excellence and they have got more to go but they have made progress. Combat Systems has had a long track record of disciplined response to their market and anticipating changes in their market and getting after their fixed cost quickly. There is no such thing as we say as fixed cost, they will ultimately turn into variable. So they have right sized their business even in advance of the change in their market conditions and I think you can see the result of that in their margin improvement, and in their margin performance.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies: Just to follow-up on land systems or combat, I’m still sort of looking at sort of the market color for opportunities. Can you either geographically or product line or some way characterize how there has been very specific interest?
Phebe Novakovic : So we continue to see within our land force as U.S. Land Forces line of business. Interest in terms of sustainment levels right? So we anticipated that and we see that, it's not a lot of -- I don’t believe new opportunities on that front. We’re however engaged in a number of international opportunities with all of the three businesses in our combat systems. The timing of the clarity around timing of international orders has been a little elusive, so I’m not about to speculate but our negotiation on several potential contracts and we will see how those turn out but there is still a lot of interest. The world hasn’t gotten any safer.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Just wanted to follow back up on the AxleTech discussion. Can you just size that business and I’m trying to just think about how much of the original sales decline was because of that business and then the absence of it how that’s playing into the combat outlook for the year?
Phebe Novakovic : You can sort of infer that from the restated sales number but that business has for the last really year undergone a precipitous decline in sales and the inversion of demand. So, I’m not going to parse out exactly the size but you can -- when we get around to selling it we will in disposing of it and finalizing the contract will give you a little bit more clarity but it was responsible for some of the decline clearly, you can see that.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities:  And then you had mentioned about risk adjusting for the U.S. Army business. If I remember right going into the year, you implied kind of a 40% reduction year-over-year, can you talk about where you stand year-to-date and what you’re expecting now from U.S. Army business?
Phebe Novakovic : Yes, so that business is consistent other than the sustainment of that line of business which really hits the IS&T business units more than it does the combat systems business units. We’re down to around 20% and declining.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.
Carter Copeland - Barclays: Just question regarding announcements made by peers yesterday on two fronts the first obviously you’re partner on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program took a pretty sizeable charge with the completion of that and renegotiation with the customer and they have lengthened out the entry in the service dates on some of those aircraft. I wondered if you could speak to the impacts that you may see from that and how you will go about evaluating that and then secondly, Lockheed who is a set contractor on the scout vehicle to you, he was talking about a pretty sizeable award they were excited about from a potential standpoint from the UK and I wondered if you could speak to timing and size or just general color about that opportunity and what it could mean for GDUK? Thank you.
Phebe Novakovic :  Yes let me talk about MHP. For the first time in many years this program has a stable way forward and has upside opportunity. We did not take charge on that program, we don’t intend to take a charge as a result of the renegotiation. We’re the supplier for Sikorsky. We have developed over the years a very good relationship with our supplier. We have been very supportive with our prime. We have been very supportive of them and this was a very significant risk reduction result for us and we have stabilized it and going forward there will be some upside. So that was very, very good move. On the SV vehicle -- Lockheed may have more information than we do but I have, this is one of the many, many markets that we continue to investigation and we’re there. We’re at the prime and on the SV [ph] - the development of the SV and how the British government and the Ministry of Defense chooses on a going forward basis to think about the production contract, it's something we start to work out with them but they are going to make that call.
Carter Copeland - Barclays: How would you think about the significance of that order relative to some of the other big orders you’ve talked about in combat in the past?
Phebe Novakovic:  Well it would be a nice order and again that is entirely driven by the druthers of that customer and what they want to see in near term production. So, the developmental program went from a very risky position to one that we have stabilized that and we have gotten it back on track technically scheduled wise and we’re -- we have done a good job and land systems team did a very good job. I’m a big believe that if you don’t build the platform you can’t integrate it. So they build those platforms, they know them, it's our core competency that’s probably one of the best in the world if not the best in the world at that and they were able to turn around a very broad program. So it's an opportunity going forward but that will be dictated in its entirety by our customer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Ron Epstein - Bank of America: On Gulfstream just to maybe follow-up on some of the previous questions. The increase in activity that you’ve seen, you’ve mentioned in your prepared remarks about the G550. Can you speak about regionally where you’ve seen it? Is it out of the emerging world? Is it out of Europe? Is it out of the U.S.? Where are you seeing maybe the tick up in demand?
Phebe Novakovic:  In each one of our airplane models what we have seen is North America is the 50% of the orders for the last 18 months. So pretty consistent North America involvement and activity in ordering. Sometimes that small fleet, corporate fleet replacement or individuals but I got to tell you the vast majority of the orders are from Fortune 500 and both primarily North America, public and private companies but also international public and private companies.
Ron Epstein - Bank of America: Okay. And in the midsized market have you seen much of the pickup there yet or is that still kind bouncing along?
Phebe Novakovic:  The 280 had a nice quarter and that airplane gets overshadowed by the 650 but it is a terrific plane in it's space and it's in niche and it's doing well. It's fits a discernible need with great capabilities.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.
Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada : Phebe, also related to your peers it does seem that a couple of them have been picking up their M&A activity since the start of the year. Are you in any way tempted to get back involved in this game?
Phebe Novakovic : We have seen -- look I’m not going to speculate on that we have seen a bit of a trickle but a trickle is not a trend mix so it's hard to know the maturity of the M&A market but so far we’re not there.
Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada : And then as a second question, really a follow-up to Ron’s question. Have you seen any changes in the pricing dynamics for new aircraft?
Phebe Novakovic: No our prices are holding up nicely. But the corollary to your question is we’re not winning these airplane orders on price, it's factor but it's one of many.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank : Maybe talk about the capital deployment for just a second. I know you have made a mention of the $500 million note coming due in January and your decision has been made to refi or repay yet. And I just wonder that in any way going to play into how you’re going to deploy free cash flow for repurchase. It looks like it's about a $1 billion after dividends of free cash flow you will have in the second half of the year to maintain this neutral position you have now on net debts. I think about that as your repo target unless I’ve to think about the refinance or repayment of the note as well. So if you can maybe -- are those two connected? 
Phebe Novakovic :  Well I think if you think about it that note is due in January. We really haven't gotten -- we really haven't put our -- focused our attention on 2015 capital deployment but you can rest assured we intend to be shareholder friendly as we have in this year.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank:  And then clarification are you still holding 40 midsized deliveries in ‘14 or is it just picked up in the midsize in terms of demand or maybe it's a little bit less.
Phebe Novakovic : We have had a couple of move around so nothing particularly material.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
Jason Gursky – Citi: Phebe just a quick question on margins. I wonder if you can just give us some updated thoughts on what you think normalized margins at Jet Aviation are going to be over the longer term and then same for combat systems. Just long term structural margins in that business over the next several years is, you look at all the cost activities that you’ve taken over the past couple of years and make the business going forward.
Phebe Novakovic:  Jet Aviation has been a story all about walking out of the shadow of the valley of death and they -- their margin performance has been increasingly positive quarter-over-quarter. They have some variability but on a quarter-to-quarter basis but the underlying operations have done very, very well and will continue to do well in every indication we see all of the metrics we watch, the EACs we built. Everything I see is on the upper trajectory and I think it's too soon to have for me to give you a definitive where out there sustaining margin to be. I have an aspiration that I’m fully confident that Jet will make but that’s an internal discussion that we have to have but they are on the right path. Now combat, I think combat -- you know combat is all going to be about their orders which they have stabilized their order and then their performance on those orders and these lines of businesses have demonstrated that they are very good operators. So I don’t want to get ahead of myself for 2016 but we ought to see some nice margin improvement in combat. There is nothing structurally that’s keeping them from not continuing to build their operating efficiency and add to it. And operator I think we have time for one more call.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.
Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton : Phebe, I just want to ask you about 2014 guidance overall especially the defense revenues you’re forecasting. It looks like all the congressional appropriations committees have reported out but it looks like maybe won't create a bill until after the November election. I was just wondering if you feel like there is any risk to your guidance from a CR [ph] that goes to November - December?
Phebe Novakovic : Not anything we can materially see. Most of what we have got is in our backlog upon which we have projected our guidance to you.
Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton :  Okay. Thank you. 
Phebe Novakovic: All right. I think that’s it for today. Thank you so much for joining our call. If you’ve additional questions I can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1, 2014 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Adrienne, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.
Erin Linnihan : Thank you, Adrienne and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' first quarter conference call.  As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic:  Thanks, Erin. I will keep my remarks relatively brief today. I think the numbers are pretty straight forward and largely speak for themselves. Earlier today we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $1.71 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.3 billion, operating earnings of $871 million and net earnings of $595 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.07 and were ahead of analyst expectations on revenue as well. We were also somewhat better than our previous guidance and ahead of our own expectations. I should point out that the diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $347.2 million for the quarter, $7.4 million shares below the fourth quarter of last year. I’ll ask Jason Aiken to give you a little more insight into our share repurchase activity when I complete my remarks.  Free cash flow for operations was $341 million, approximately 57% of net income. This is typical to the first quarter. But I should add that we expected particularly robust second quarter from a free cash flow perspective driven in part by advance payments on international orders. In many respect the story for the quarter is about the order book, particularly in defense. We ended the quarter with the total backlog of $56 billion, up approximately $10 billion over the last quarter with particularly impressive growth in combat systems backlog. Marine systems backlog grew and IS&T had a modest gain after adjusting for some of the backlog in the UK that was transferred to combat systems.  Interestingly we have more funded backlog at the end of this quarter than we've had any time in the last three years, the same is true for total backlog. We also look forward to a strong second quarter intake, particularly marine system with the anticipated booking of the Block IV Virginia class multi-year contract, the underpinnings of our defense businesses are clearly solidifying.  Compared to the first quarter 2013 revenue was down less than expected $80 million or 1.1%. On the other hand operating earnings were up $24 million or 2.8%. Our operating cost and expenses were $104 million less than the year ago quarter leading to a 50 basis point improvement in margins at 11.9%, this is very strong operating leverage.  Net earnings were up even more than operating earnings, 4.2% versus 2.8% primarily due to lower tax rate. EPS was up 5.6% over the year ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings, lower tax rate and lower share count.  Let me provide some commentary and a little bit of perspective around the results of our operating segments, first Aerospace. Sales are up over Q1, 2013 by $347 million, 19.5% and essentially flat sequentially. Earnings outpaced the year-ago quarter by $94 million about 30%. Compared to Q4, 2013 operating earnings are up $56 million or 16% principally due to mix shift and continuous improvement on 650 production and completion efficiency.  This resulted in 19% margin for the group. Again Jet Aviation's continuing profitability made a nice contribution. Orders were not strong in the quarter but need to be viewed in the context of a very robust fourth quarter 2013 order book. We are off to a very good start in the Aerospace group  Marine systems, revenue was off 1.5%, $25 million compared to the year ago quarter. The sequential story is similar with respect to revenue. However, operating earnings were up $7 million 4.4% against the year ago and the same sequentially.  The real story in the quarter is a 10.4% margin rate which is really top notch and better than expected. All of the shipyards performed well in the quarter. Backlog grew $837 million in the quarter with significantly more to come in the second quarter, as I mentioned a few minutes ago.  At Combat Systems, compared to the first quarter of 2013 sales were down $236 million or 15.2% and earnings were down $79 million or 36.7% on a margin of 10.3. It is important to note however that these results were impacted by a $29 million restructuring charge at ELF as a result of reduction in our Austrian operations which were consolidated into Spain and Switzerland.  If we disregard that charge margins would be 12.5%. Despite the restructuring charge ELF is expected to have operating margins around 10% for the year. The big story here is the large international order that finally came through. Total backlog is up $10.2 billion over the year-end number. Each of the combat systems businesses filled backlog in the quarter. You should see steady revenue, earnings and margin rate performance improvement throughout the year in this group.  IS&T, The revenue in this business group is holding up well in this difficult environment. You might recall that our guidance to you was to expect a revenue decline of 20% year-over-year but it didn't happen in first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was up $166 million or 6.8% against a year ago quarter. It was off 15.2% sequentially. Operating earnings of $183 million in the quarter were only $2 million less than the year ago quarter on a 40 basis point improvement in margins.  On a sequential basis operating earnings were $13 million lower or 66.6% on a 70 basis point improvement in margins, once again exhibiting nice operating leverage. Total backlog for the Group was down $43 million from year-end but that includes a $248 million transfer of backlog from our UK business to combat system. Absent that transfer IS&T backlog actually grew. So once again IS&T is off to a good start. And thinking about the rest of the year we are increasing our EPS guidance to $7.05 to $7.10 from our initial expectation of $6.80 to $6.85. The increase assumes currently anticipated operating performance and the share count reduction realized in the first quarter. Think about the quarterly performance is lower in the second, flat in the third quarter with a strong Q4 finish. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken. 
Jason W. Aiken : Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I will take just a few minutes to review some financial items with you before we start the question-and-answer period. Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $23 million in the first quarter of 2013. For 2014 we expect net interest expense to be approximately $90 million.  At the end of the quarter our balance sheet reflects the net cash position, that’s cash in excess of debt of $385 million, a decrease of $1 billion from the end of 2013. This decrease is due in large part to our activities on the capital deployment front which I will address in just a minute. We don't have any scheduled debt repayment until January of next year when $500 million of fixed rate notes will mature.  Our effective tax rate of 30.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected, primarily as a result of the close out of the 2012 tax year. For the full year we still expect our effective tax rate to fall between 30.5% and 31%. We expect cash contribution to our pension plan 2014 to be around $550 million to fund our obligation. The bulk of funding is scheduled to occur in second half of the year, specifically during the third quarter.  As an update to our capital deployment plan I would like to address our activities in the first quarter. As you will recall we entered into an accelerated share repurchase plan in late January to repurchase 11.4 million of our shares. This exhausted our remaining repurchase authorization and in early February our Board authorized repurchase of an additional 20 million shares. Since then we repurchased 3 million more shares during the quarter. In total we deployed approximately $1.7 billion on share repurchases and divided payments in the quarter.  In March our Board declared a dividend increase of more than 10%, that's the 17th consecutive annual increase. Our intent in 2014 is to return essentially all of our free cash flow to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter we have $4.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet and are well positioned to execute our capital deployment strategy during the coming quarters and achieve the objective of [inaudible] 2014.  Erin, that concludes my remarks. I will turn it back over to you for the Q&A. 
Erin Linnihan:  Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. Adrienne, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And the first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi Group. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup:  Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. Good morning. Just a quick question on Gulfstream. You mentioned the bookings there being down quarter-on-quarter after a really nice finish to last year. I am just wondering if you can remind us of the seasonality that we typically should expect with bookings at Gulfstream just to kind of help everybody get prepared for the rest of the year kind of based on what you see in your pipeline at this point. What do bookings look like on a quarter-to-quarter basis throughout the rest of the year?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So the new aircraft sales opportunities continue to look very good and we got strong customer interest but we are still seeing extended negotiation periods in order to get that order closed and what that drives is some difficulty in being very specific and precise about the quarterly progression. So our orders have intended to be a little lumpier like in the first quarter building with a strong fourth quarter finish. That’s the pattern that we have been looking at for a while and this year looks about the same with no material difference. But the order interest, the activity is very-very strong. It’s just when we get to closure and that’s what makes it difficult for us to be real clear and specific on quarter timing.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: And the mix that you are seeing at this point, is it still favoring the large cabins versus the mid cabins?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. We talk the last couple of call about understanding our mix and our order activity and when you have got a four year backlog on the 650s, you are not likely to see and in fact it's somewhat impossible to get a one-to-one book-to-bill. So what we follow very carefully is the order activity and sign-ups for large cabin, mature aircraft, 450 and 550 and 60% of the orders in the quarter were for those two models. So again, very, very strong for the 450 and 550.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: Phebe, I have just a follow-up on that. I was wondering if you could comment on the sort of pricing. You are saying in the new and used jet market and also if you have seen any impact from the recent activity over in Ukraine and Russia?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So, pricing is holding up nicely in the pre-owned market and looks to be stabilizing in the large cabin market, particularly on the 550. In the mid-cabin, we see a little bit more pricing pressure but that is nothing new. This is consistent with what we have seen in the past. And so far the activities in Ukraine and Russia have not affected our operations. Our Moscow operations are continuing and Gulfstream hasn't seen any material activity.
Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada: Great, thanks so much.
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank:  Thanks. Good morning, good quarter. Phebe, if I could go through one-by-one but may be the segments and your outlooks have been revised, much particularly on the margin if you want to extricate the kind of the margin guidance you are looking for as well as aero guidance for margins and maybe IS&T sales?
Phebe N. Novakovic:  Yes. So we didn't give specific update for the segment guidance and we are holding to it at the moment. We will update it in the second quarter when we've got more clarity about where exactly the puts and takes are across the business, but we are confident enough to increase our overall guidance. So we are very comfortable with that. With respect -- and I will just tell you, with respect to combat in particular we are still holding to our low to mid 14% range in aerospace we are still looking at the 17% margin range. So nothing has changed and we are very confident in both of those numbers.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And the upper IS&T sales? Phebe N. Novakovic IS&T sales were stronger in first quarter then we had anticipated and we have good order activity. But again, IS&T sales are pretty lumpy, driven in large measure by our healthcare business, which is highly seasonal and we usually only get about a quarter advance notice when it comes to the customers interest and increasing the sales volume.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Okay, good luck. Good quarter. Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic:  Thanks.
Operator:  Next question come from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Phebe N. Novakovic:  Hi, Joe.
Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan:  Thanks. Good morning Phebe. Just wanted to dig into the aerospace margin a little bit. I hear you on maintaining the guidance for now since it's early but you beat December by a couple of basis points, last year obviously Q1 was a very strong start. May be if you could give us a couple of reasons why we shouldn't get too far in front of you on aerospace margin side.
Phebe N. Novakovic:  Let me talk a little bit about margins in quarter versus our budget and they are attributable to two primary factors, lower than anticipated pre-owned sales and better than expected G650 cost performance. So going forward we don't see that margin performance repeating for a whole host of reasons mix shift, supplier cost, timing of other expenses. So when we factor all of those into our thinking at the moment we don’t see that kind of upside to margins over our guidance. 
Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein - Bank of America: Good morning, Phebe.
Phebe N. Novakovic : Hi. Ron.
Ronald Epstein- Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Big picture question for you. If you stand back and observe the operating profit of the company in the quarter, nearly about 46% of it was from [inaudible]. So General Dynamics now looks like it’s almost a half a commercial aerospace company and half a defense contractor. How do you think about that strategically about the positioning of the company? And when you think about deploying capital and that sort of mix?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So we like our strategic positioning. I like that balance between aerospace and defense, and that our defense business is as I pointed out and we’ve seen now quarter-over-quarter through the last year are holding up very, very nicely. With implicit growth in the marine group, which we don’t talk of a whole lot about, it doesn’t get a lot of attention but in addition to block IV we’ve got considerable suitable revenue upside for the next several years as we move increasingly into a higher replacement and we gear up even more on the two year of Virginia class construction. So there is some upside in our first of our current sort of sales profile on the defense side driven primarily by marine group but not exclusively. So stabilized combat and IS&T is continuing to hold the trend.  So I like where we are with respect to our balance between our commercial aerospace and business jet market and defense. When you think about capital deployment I think clearly we need to -- we will and we do make investments where we believe we are likely to get a good return and you will see over the last, frankly almost decade now, we’ve been heavily investing in Gulfstream and that investment is beginning to pay-off with very purposeful our capital deployment strategy at Gulfstream, because we believe and history has proven us correct that it was a business jet market and our place in that market was a good market to invest in.  So I think that the rectitude of that, the series of positions many years ago that we're continuing to follow makes it an awful lot of sense. So I think going forward you can expect the same kind of behavior for us so we see an opportunity to grow very accretively and profitably we will.
Ronald Epstein- Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned- Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Thank you, good morning. I am interested in the Minsheng order which was just announced. And I think it’s a very interesting situation but I am trying to understand the majority of the airplanes in your previous, the 2011 order those have still not been delivered. And I am curious what your expectations are regarding the timing of the deliveries in this very large order in the next several years. 
Phebe N. Novakovic:  So I think the underlying assumptions in your -- in the beginning of your questions on Minsheng we have delivered a number of those airplanes. Going forward we have conservatively booked that order, the order was for 60 aircraft and another 20 options and we were very conservative in our bookings of those firm orders. So as we go forward and we like -- that’s a terrific business for us Minsheng is a close partner. We have a very good relationship with them and we see that as steady. It will come in episodic orders, speed orders but so far we like where we are.
Doug Harned- Sanford C. Bernstein & Co: I am assuming that this is something. This is really a long term situation that’s very tied to what happens in China in terms of demand, is that fair?
Phebe N. Novakovic:  Yes, it is fair. But we have a history with Minsheng that when they place an order they mean it. And when we declare it when we move it from estimated potential contract value in to firm orders we have got a lot of deposits and we have a slot and a delivery profile. So, so, that's again we are -- this isn't a big pop with no substance. When we announced these orders with Minsheng the full intension is to execute and with -- you know our commercial exposure right, it's going to be driven by macroeconomic factors but so far there's considerable demand for these airplanes in China.
Doug Harned- Sanford C. Bernstein & Co: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment - Sterne Agee:  Yes, good morning and nice quarter Phebe. Phebe, can I just ask kind of a back to kind of Ron's question, more of a big picture now that the budgets out the green book out, could you maybe give us a little, how do you think GD is positioned domestically here both combat and marine on some of those core programs? You touched upon it on the Virginia-class and the Ohio class replacement but maybe just how you are thinking about given the DoD outlook.
Phebe N. Novakovic: So a couple of things. Absent a significant change in the threat environment, or a return to the sort of self-destructive government behavior across the board spending type, we believe that we have crossed at least in our programs and I would point you to the strong backlog as a harbinger of our sales performance. The majority of our programs are programs of record and as we talked before they tend to fare better in a funding constrained environment. So combat, combat's going forward profile is, is heavily dependent and tied to international orders. We have seen those orders begin to come in. There are more out there in our pipeline, frankly fairly robust. The investments spending on both army and the marine core is at sustainment levels and we factored back into our plan and we are comfortable with that those programs that we have on our plan are executable and that the funding is available.  And to marine I touched on the two big drivers of Ohio replacement and the Virginia-class through the year. We also see continued interest in commercial containership and tanker market. So those again, those orders for the commercial during that ship building tend to be a little bit more of the products but we still have a healthy pipeline that we are continuing to explore with our customers. So if I step back in IS&T, IS&T has again largely we believe stabilized itself. It's a growth engine there being GVIT, not surprisingly. Our ISR business is stable with long standing programs of record. And our networking and communication business has downsized itself in response to the revenue decline and again has programs of record that they are continuing to execute on.  So across the board I think that we are on the defense side very well positioned. Again I point you to our backlog. 
Peter Arment - Sterne Agee: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities:  Good morning. 
Phebe N. Novakovic: Hi, Sam.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Hi. I wanted to see if you can talk a little bit more about combat systems and I am just trying to understand a couple of things. One is you know an order of magnitude in terms of the advances benefit you expect to get in Q2. And then trying to just think about how do you go from a 10% margin now to a 14% margin for the year. You mentioned the EOS restructuring charge even if you take that out, you still have to have some high teens type of margins and I am not sure what drives that.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Sure. So let me talk a little bit more about the Q1 margins. I mentioned our $29 million charge. We also have some contract mix, changes across the group that will normalize as we go through the year quarter-over-quarter. And you will recall that we moved the specialty vehicle to UK Vehicle program out of the backlog in IS&T and in to combat and that is a conservatively booked program given the state that it was in at the beginning of 2013.  So those were some of the margin pressures we saw in the first quarter. With respect to going forward I think that this group has amply demonstrated their ability to reduce costs faster than revenues declined. So we've seen quite a bit of operating leverage from them. As you think about Combat Systems at the height of their revenue and in 2009 kind of crowding 10 billion we've seen a 40% decline in margins and yet last year we had -- in revenue last year we had 15% margins and this year we are looking at 14% and I don't see anything in our backlog or in our performance year-to-date that would suggest that we're going to have headwinds on margins.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. And any sense in terms of the advanced benefit you mentioned in the second quarter? 
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes so it's going to be in excess of $1 billion and but again much of that will be deployed quickly obviously to our subcontractors. 
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Good morning Phebe and Jason. Quick question Phebe about your comment on the 650. You noted you had better cost performance there in the quarter, I wondered if you might give us some color on whether that was recurring or non-recurring in nature. How should we think about the implications there for the learning curve relative to your prior comment? 
Phebe N. Novakovic: So we are continuing to come down that learning curve. And our 650 margin performance on both the green airplanes and outfitted the airplanes is improving quarter-over-quarter. So very nice operating performance on the 650, and we expect that to continue. Certainly we're going to -- the learning curve will flatten out as we go forward but so far we expect to see additional margin improvement on both green and outfitted airplane.
Phebe N. Novakovic: But there wasn't anything in the quarter, specifically that the benefit is…
Phebe N. Novakovic: These are repeatable. 
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Okay, thank you. 
Phebe N. Novakovic: Margins are repeatable. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Phebe, if we could just dig into IS&T a little bit more obviously you did outperform the expectations and the guidance here in the quarter. How much of that is -- it sounds like you think that's potentially sustainable or is it just the army pressure is somewhat delayed and may be not even fully a 2014 event and I guess I am speaking more to the C4 side. 
Phebe N. Novakovic: So C4 saw the largest decline in the quarter in-line with our plan and as you'll recall we talked quite a bit at the end of last year and beginning of this year about our attempt to de-risk our army exposures C4 has done that. So what we see right now going forward to C4 is they've got almost everything in all their revenue in their backlog.  So I think that they can see some stability from a revenue perspective based on our expectations going forward. And again their programs of records particularly when TR are really doing quite nicely. Each one of those businesses had a book-to-bill of 0.9 or greater. So that also tells me that there is support for our products. So they've got C4 so let's recall has exposure to the UK and Canada and fairly robust exposure in both markets. So that helped offset some of the uncertainty we've had in the past about army spending. 
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: So the 33% reduction in sales you talked about in January, is that off the table or you're simply saying you are observing it well enough with strength elsewhere?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yeah, I thought I gave you around a 20% decline.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Well 20% overall for the unit, right?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yeah. It too soon for us to walk back from that decline. We had a good first quarter, a good book to bill but I don't want to get out ahead of that because as I mentioned earlier one of the big drivers is that the largest driver in IS&T revenue is going to be our healthcare business and that is very, very seasonal and we usually -- what our experience has been over the last year and half we only get a quarter worth of notice, the warning that we are going to have to up our activity. 
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Right. Well maybe another way to ask the same question is was the President’s budget with the drawdown in army down to the mid-400,000 level, is that already contemplated in your guidance, does that match up with what you are planning for?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yeah.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic: No surprises there and no reason to adjust. 
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Right, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company:  Yes, thanks so much, Phebe. So if we can maybe get a little more color to help us reconcile the downtick in margins at Gulfstream from 19% to like 17% plus, 17.6% for the year. I mean if in fact you are doing well on G650 with more learning curve improvement to come I would think that would be in margin plus as we move forward and you also have mentioned used biz jet sales being weak, I mean is there higher, I mean I assume they are not hugely -- the volume looked so good in that quarter. I still have a little trouble understanding how you know your guide for the year isn't quite a bit low. 
Phebe N. Novakovic: So the pre-armed and let me give you a little bit more color on this. The pre-armed sales activity was lower in the quarter that we had anticipated but we still expect to take pre-armed and remainder of the year that obviously has margin headwind. We also going to have some mix shift that we are anticipating. Timing and other expenses and we thought supplier cost that we are factoring into our thinking. So it is 650 performance continues to be good but as we go out to produce more mid cabins we are going to see those are lower margins particularly on both of those 280 and the 150 and that provides you know that causes some headwind in margin activity.  So it’s really the big shift, supplier cost and timing that make us properly cautious about the margin expectations for the year.
Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company: Okay but it looks like you know your guide, as I take it of large cabin deliveries you did 25 and aren't we looking for something like 118 for the year and so well yes we do have an uptick coming in terms of the mid-size. You know you also have on the larger planes in the mid-size you know are considerably less revenue. So I guess I am still is it something at jet or services, you know that is changing the mix because I think you explained just on the surface the mix doesn’t look like it’s that much worse. 
Phebe N. Novakovic: You know the 450 is a lower margin airplane than the 550, in fact 650 margins have now exceeded the 450 margins largely because of the supplier cost that we talked about before and those increases in supplier cost hit the 450 pretty robustly. So the service activity we anticipate continued a good strong level of service activity. It’s very, very strong in the quarter and going forward jet continues to be profitable.  So I really go back to mix our shift on 450’s and mid-cabins and higher pre-owned, our supplier cost and then the timing of some other expenses. So it really is premature from us to get out there and project -- I don’t see at it at the moment, 19% or 18% margins doesn’t mean we also….
Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company: So your information is basically that within the large cabin the mix is shifting pretty sharply toward the 450 which is the lower margin product?
Phebe N. Novakovic: That’s right. Well not pretty sharply but it is shifting. And those margins have been compressed for the reasons we…
Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company:   Okay. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Please go ahead.
David Strauss – UBS: Good morning, Phebe?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Hi, David.
David Strauss – UBS: Want to ask you about the balance sheet, even with the big quarter in terms of share repo you sit on net cash position I know you committed to returning 100% of free cash flow this year but would still be in a net cash position. So can you just talk about thoughts from the balance sheet any kind of leverage levels you are thinking about just utilizing looking to utilize balance sheet little bit more? Thanks.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Let me give you sort of overarching view and then I’ll let Jason give you some more color. But we used our balance sheet when we believe that there's an appropriate opportunity to make accretive investments. We have sufficient cash flow for this year to support the kind of share repurchases and dividends that we anticipate. So I frankly like where we are, and we like our credit rating we want to retain it. We don’t see any reason to leverage the balance sheet to get a quick path in share repurchases that aren’t necessarily repeatable in the next year. And this is too much of your future flexibility, not what we want to be.
Jason W. Aiken: Yeah and just to add to that maybe in the quarter you saw that we did essentially "use the balance sheet to the tune of a billion dollars" that was really the effect of the ASR and fulfilling the commitments that we made last year which earned free cash flow to shareholders. So that was in effect our use of the balance sheet for this year and it really articulated both the plans just want to get efficient free cash flow forecasted and find that try to return that to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. 
David Strauss – UBS: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Good morning. 
Phebe N. Novakovic: Hi George.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Phebe since you are not changing any guidance at this point on the sectors is it fair to assume that the increase in your EPS is coming primarily from the share buybacks because you historically don’t ever factor that into your guidance?
Phebe N. Novakovic:  It comes from three things. The maintaining or at least anticipating the EPS-based on our current share count. We see operating improvements that are driving about half of our current increase in our estimates on EPS. And but that we are not in a position to parse that, those operating improvements with any details among the four units. That’s why I think I am far more comfortable in giving you that kind of color on the second quarter when we’ve got more clarity about where we’ve been through the half of the year and how the rest of the year shapes up.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Okay and one follow-up. The 650 it's been lots of discussion in the paper is it used planes are commanding like a $10 million premium to what you are selling them for. I mean what’s your plan as far as increasing the rate on that 650?
Phebe N. Novakovic: You mean the -- what you mean the production rate?
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Increase in your production rate given that demand seems to be so strong.
Phebe N. Novakovic: So we want to as you know our past behavior will influence us going forward. We raise our production rates when we are confident that we can execute efficiently, green deliveries and profitable, green deliveries and outfitting. You will recall on the 650 we spent a majority of last year working through the -- what we call the dis-equilibrium on the retrofit. So that's -- we're mindful that we had a pretty detailed plan that we effectively put behind us. But it seems to me a bit -- I guess imprudent to get up there and begun to pump up the production rate until we have got more experience on a quarter-by-quarter basis on both the green deliveries and outfitting. So we are properly balanced at the moment. We will consider increases in rates. We do that at the end of every year and then that's how we set our guidance for you in the following year.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question comes from line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company:  Good morning.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Hi.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Phebe, I think last year you might have termed 2013 as a back-to-basics year.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: And so, what's 2014 going to be about?
Phebe N. Novakovic:  More back-to-basics. I don't think you can ever get away from absolute requirement to improve your operating performance quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. You never got enough, you're never done. So that is going to be a strategic focus and tactical execution of this management team going forward. In addition we are -- I think that's been clear from our behavior heretofore in the year that we anticipate the deployment of all if -- most if not all of our free cash flow in dividend and share repurchases.  So that's something we were not able to accomplish last year that we will. So increased focus on the shareholder friendly cash deployment and more blocking and tackling on operation, return in invested capital, expanding margin and managing for cash. It's just never done.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Just a follow-up on that and I agree that makes a lot of sense, but somewhere in here, you need to make that there is the right investment for the future of each of the businesses. So you don't want to harvest too much to, and you clearly talk about whether it -- ships or Ohio class or this new opportunity internationally. But could you be -- could you give us a couple of other examples where in the couple of other business units where you are seeing new product that also going to provide some of this basic or organic growth?
Phebe N. Novakovic:  Yes. So you quite rightly pointed out that in the marine group we have organic growth potential and therefore as you would expect we have invested in the marine group, largely in infrastructure and capital structure since those are capital intensive businesses. In combat, what we have really our raise on that the last year and for this year as well is to size that business accordingly. But we make investments as we go along in those lines of business where we see a profitable return. So I think you can see that and our expectations on ELS.  We have invested by fairly significant investments in restructuring, why to make that business more competitive and we're beginning to see fruits of that labor. That's also true in the UK. You have had significant restructuring charges in the UK to make us more competitive, and position ourselves for again organic growth and that's in the IS&T business. Our Intel and ISR business, we continue to invest in appropriate with the returns we expect in the market. Our IT Services business is a low investment business by definition. So I don't really see an organic requirement to invest in the IS&T business in C4. We invest appropriately Canada and the UK and right size the business in the United States with the demand. 
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Thank you very much. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John Godyn, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley:  Hey thank you for taking my question. We heard a lot of questions on the Aerospace segment but I wanted to ask one more. Phebe last quarter you mentioned that there would be a dramatic rise in fourth quarter margins as you thought about the cadence throughout the year. Just given with the performance in the first quarter and what we've heard about your guidance for the full year, I am not sure if that is still valid. 
Phebe N. Novakovic: I think I will anticipate where you are headed in this quarter. We pulled some of the margin performance into the first quarter so I expect the fourth quarter to be lighter than the first quarter. That is different than we anticipated when we gave the guidance which was light in the first quarter and then building with the strong fourth quarter. We still expect a strong fourth quarter but not at the same level for all the reasons that we've articulated this morning. 
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley: And perhaps the more important kind of takeaway from this is I think that had given some investors confidence that as we thought about 2015, the exit rate was robust and we would be set up for continued margin expansion in Aerospace. Is that framework still right?  [Technical Difficulty]
Phebe N. Novakovic: Do we still have an analyst with a question? 
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley: Hi, this is John can you hear me? 
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes it's a good thing our communications products are more reliable than this thing, who knows what happened. 
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley: Glad to have you back. What I had asked was I think the comment about fourth quarter seeing a ramp has given some confidence on continued margin expansion in aerospace in 2015. Is that still the right framework to use today with the new guidance?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So I think as we think about 2015 it's obviously too soon to tell and we'll -- there are lot of factors that will emerge during the course of the year that will influence and inform our margin guidance but we anticipate that aerospace will continue to have very strong margin performance, both at Gulfstream, both this year and but equally important in ’15 at Gulfstream as the 650 continues to come down its learning curve, and also at Jet Aviation which is increasingly profitable. So nice performance at jet and they are positioned to increase their order book. They solved their operating challenges and so I expect more upside margin ignition from jet. 
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Just thoughts about the future.
Erin Linnihan: Adrienne, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator:  The next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.
Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton:  Yes, good morning. I just want to ask one on Marine and maybe a follow-up. Phebe It looks like marine repair that business has been a real great growth driver for you over the last four or five years. I know you got done some deals there. But I am just wondering you know with the navy fleet staying at a pretty low level and being kind of tasked increasingly around the world. Is repair kind of an ongoing growth story for you from that perspective?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yeah, so you know I think somebody asked that question earlier about investments. Kind of this was the place where we made an investment, I was EDP at the marine group and I felt very strongly at the time that we needed to expand our repair footprint and we did that, so that we are now bi-coastal. In fact we are heavily represented in four of the five maybe home ports and we did that purposely with the expectation that as the fleet ages repair workflow increase. I frankly like repair work in general. It’s steady, it’s fairly predictable performance and very predictable performance if you know what you are doing and we do. So it’s been a nice on the surface side, it’s been a nice growth engine for us. We also just recently won up in the Pacific North West a very large repair contract for CVM. So that again expands our footprint b-coastally.  On the submarine side, submarine repair work tends to come from two sources, one excess workflow from the public yards and second emerging demand that as the fleet experiences issues well under sea, so in both of those instances we have seen fairly lumpy but when we get it pretty profitable submarine repair work.
Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton: Got it.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Your assumption is quite correct that we have liked those investments, the return on those investments that we made in surface repair business.
Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton: Got it, thank you. And just one follow up on marine, I am just wondering as you ramp in commercial volumes you guys won a lot of orders there, if there’s going to be any negative impact to marine margin and then a similar issue on marine margin, similar question about this recent Virginia sub marine pay load marginal issue, if that would be any impact to margin rate. 
Phebe N. Novakovic: So for very high performing shipyards, which our three shipyards are, margins change quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year almost entirely based on mix. So you would expect that when we get increase we get a new order we are going to see some margin compression, as we come down our learning curve you will see margins expand. That’s true on both the Naval, ship building side as well as the commercial ship building side. So NASSCO had very, very good margin performance on both its navy and commercial ship building work revenue, largely driven by just performance improvement quarter-over-quarter, day-after-day. The pay load issue we don't anticipate any margin compression on the issue that has come up with the North Dakota. We discovered that in concert with our navy customer and are addressing their requirements to do a complete inspection. So no real I mean it was a surprise and unfortunate. But we are [nearly set back] with our flow under control and it's frankly it's a supplier issue and we will address that. 
Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton: Got it, very helpful, thank you. 
Phebe N. Novakovic: Thanks

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the 4Q 2013 and FY 2013 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is [Whitley] (ph), and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Miss Erin Linnihan. Please proceed, ma'am.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you, [Whitley] (ph), and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Thank you, Erin. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $1.76 per fully diluted share on a revenue of $8.1 billion and earnings of $624 million. It was a good quarter, consistent with our previous guidance and analyst expectation. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $7.03 on revenue of $31.2 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.5 billion, a return on sales of 8%. It was a very solid year from an operating perspective. EPS, after charge in discontinued operations related exclusively to the settlement of the A-12 litigation, is $1.40 for the quarter and $6.67 for the year. The settlement represents significant risk mitigation for the Company and ends more than two decades of litigation with the government on favorable terms. We had a tremendous quarter from a cash generation perspective. Free cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion or 222% of earnings from continuing operations. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $2.7 billion or 107% of earnings from continuing operations. This outpaced 2012 by $429 million and demonstrated our commitment to the efficient conversion of earnings into cash. Let me give you some details on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Sales are up over Q4 2012 by $274 million, 14.7%, and essentially flat sequentially. Earnings significantly outpaced year ago quarter due to the write-off at Jet Aviation in that quarter. Without regard to the write-off, on a non-GAAP basis, earnings still outpaced the year ago by $88 million or 34%. By the way, the basis for all non-GAAP comparisons could be found on Exhibits K, L and M in the press release. Compared to Q3, operating earnings are down as anticipated by $21 million, principally due to mix shift. For example, lower margin mid-size green aircraft revenue essentially doubled in the quarter while G550 and G450 green revenue declined. As a result, margins decreased by about 80 basis points as we had predicted on last quarter's call. G&A expenses were also somewhat higher at Gulfstream as a result of commissions on strong sales activity. Net R&D was similar to the prior quarter. There was also a modest loss on pre-owned sales as well in the quarter. Jet remained nicely profitable in the quarter, but the contribution was not as good as it was in Q3. Nevertheless, margin at 16.3% was slightly ahead of our guidance and analyst expectations. I was particularly pleased with the order book in the quarter. Orders at a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 or greater, as occurs here, not only increased backlog but add backlog where it was needed in the 550 and 450 programs. To help you understand this, let me say that while we continue to sign up G650 buyers, it is nowhere near the rate of deliveries given the duration of this backlog. For the last year, book-to-bill on this product has averaged 0.4 to 1. Given this fact and aggregate book-to-bill of 0.7 or 0.8 to 1 in a quarter, it is very strong for us. This will of course change as the rate between order and entry into service for the G650 moves closer to 24 months, when the standard should once again return to 1 to 1. On occasion, it is useful to reflect on the guidance given last year at this time and compare it with the actual outcome. In the Aerospace group, we guided to revenue growth of 16% and operating margins in the mid-15% range. Our actual performance reflects a revenue increase of 17.4% and operating margin of 17.4%, almost 200 basis points better than guidance. This very good result was attributable to a better than expected recovery of Jet Aviation, a very successful execution of 650 deliveries, and better than expected performance in Gulfstream's large service business. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace. At Combat Systems, it is a story of disappointing revenue and outstanding cost and margin performance. In the quarter, sales were down $325 million or 16.4% but earnings were materially better because of the large write-off at ELS in Q4 of last year. Even if we disregard those write-offs, earnings are only down 8.2% on the strength of improved margins across the board. The story is much the same for the full year. Sales are down $1.9 billion or 23.4% but earnings are up $241 million or 36.3%. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings are down $164 million or 15.4%, once again demonstrating positive operating leverage with improved margins year-over-year in each business. As you all know, we had extreme difficulty predicting revenue in this group throughout the year. Our initial guidance was to expect revenue to be down 6% for the year. We retreated from that initial forecast quarter-over-quarter but never did catch up with reality, which was a revenue decline of 23.4%. What made us so wrong? The difference between the initial guidance and the final revenue result is $1.4 billion. Of that, about $500 million is attributable to the impact of sequestration and the shutdown. This was the only group to be affected materially, in no small measure because of the Army's response to both the shutdown and sequestration. Army spending slowed during the year which hit us hard in the fourth quarter as they worried about the potential shortage of funds and its impact on their ability to take care of the war effort. Our service set moreover reacted very cautiously to disruptions in their funding stream. Another roughly $500 million was attributed to a large international order expected early in the year that kept slipping to the right in very protected negotiation. The balance was from various programs where funds were appropriated but not obligated by the customer or obligated in smaller amounts as well at several additional international orders. Fortunately, this revenue shortfall was offset in part by dramatically improved operating performance resulting in higher than anticipated margin rate. Marine Systems, revenue was off 2%, $34 million, compared to the year ago quarter and down $67 million to 3.9% sequentially. However, revenue was up almost 2% for the year, about $120 million. Operating earnings were down $37 million, 18.9%, against the year ago quarter, and down $11 million, 6.5%, sequentially. For the full year, earnings were down $84 million or 11.2%. The earnings decline against last year and last year's fourth quarter is due entirely to the end of the profitable T-AKE program. This group was highly consistent in both revenue and earnings throughout the year with a 9.9% margin rate for the year. All of the shipyards performed well in the quarter and for the year. In the Marine group, we guided you to a revenue increase of 2%. We were very close with an actual increase of 1.8%. We forecasted margins in the low to mid 9% range and wound up at 9.9% on the strength of very good operating performance in each of our shipyards. All in all, a very good year for the Marine group. IS&T is the business group that held up well in a difficult environment. Revenue in the quarter was up $114 million or 4.4% against the year ago quarter. It was up a similar amount, 4.3%, sequentially, and up $251 million or 2.5% for the year, really quite good for a short cycle business in last year's turbulence. Operating earnings of $196 million in the quarter were materially better than the fourth quarter a year ago, because if you will recall, significant charges were incurred in that quarter. However, even on a non-GAAP basis, in other words without regard to the write-offs, operating earnings improved quarter-over-quarter by $68 million or 53.1%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were off by $20 million. For the year on a non-GAAP basis, earnings were within [$3 million] (ph), so essentially flat. On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance for this group that forecasted a decline in revenue of 5% and operating margins in the low 8% range. It turned out that revenue was up 2.5% and margins were 7.7%. Margins were pressured in two of the businesses units by severance and other restructuring costs as well as the failure of the business in the U.K. to meet its plan. All in all, the end result was consistent with guidance but achieved in a different way. On a Company-wide basis, we provided EPS guidance of $6.60 to $6.70. We wound up at $7.03. About $0.09 of that improvement came from share repurchase, another $0.09 from a slight rate lower than planned tax rate, and the balance from operating performance. So let me give you a few thoughts about 2014 initially by business group. In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be about $9 billion, up around 11%. Margin rate should be around 17%, somewhat down from 2013 on continuing mix shift. However, operating earnings will be up 7.3% to 7.5%. I should add that margin rates will be lower in the first three quarters with a dramatic increase in the fourth. In Combat Systems, we expect a more modest revenue decline of about 4% to 4.5%. Embedded in this plan is about $1.2 billion of revenue for the same international program that slipped to the right last year. We anticipate a first quarter order. If not received on that schedule, we will have further erosion of revenue from this guidance and we will address its impact directly with you in the second quarter. The majority of next year's domestic revenue is in our backlog and has been de-rated. So, absent more delays on the international front, we should be pretty close to our estimate of revenue. Margins are expected to be around 14%, still very respectable. The Marine group is expected to have revenue growth of 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range, resulting in a very modest slip in operating earnings, entirely the result of mix shift. Finally, in IS&T, we expect a revenue decline of almost 20%, but an improved margin rate of 8.2%, 50 basis points better than last year. Almost all of the anticipated revenue is in backlog and our plan shows this year is the low watermark for revenue. All of this rolls up to an operating plan of about $30 billion of revenue, EBIT rate around 12%, and a return on sales of roughly 8%. This plan is purely from operations, assumes a 31% tax rate and assumes we buy enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as not to permit dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $6.80 to $6.85 per fully diluted share, that compares with last year's guidance of $6.60 to $6.70, at the same time on the same basis. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the plan and the use of capital to repurchase shares. With respect to share repurchase, as is obvious, we did not return all of our free cash flow in 2013 to our shareholders despite our intention to do so. This was because we were constrained by a pension funding rule that our CFO, Jason Aiken, will explain to you shortly. It is our intention to make up for last year in the first quarter. With that in mind, we are establishing imminently an accelerated share repurchase plan for the repurchase of 11.4 million shares, the remainder of our current authorization. We will seek additional share authority at our February Board of Directors meeting for a share repurchase plan throughout the year. I would now like to turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.
Jason W. Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I want to review a few financial items with you before the question-and-answer period, starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The full year's interest expense in 2013 was $86 million, which was in line with our guidance. This was down $70 million from 2012, reflecting the impact of our $2.4 billion debt refinancing completed in December 2012 that lowered the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 2.2%. For 2014, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $90 million. At the end of the year, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, and by that I mean cash in excess of debt, of approximately $1.4 billion, an improvement of more than $2 billion over our net debt position last year. Moving on to taxes, our effective tax rate was 30.7% for the quarter and 31.1% for the full year. The fourth quarter and full-year rates were slightly lower than anticipated due to a tax benefit associated with the shutdown of a product line in one of our IS&T businesses. That said, we expect an effective tax rate in 2014 and for the foreseeable future in the range of 30.5% to 31%. So you can consider a rate in this range to be the new normal. This is driven by a variety of puts and takes, but primarily by higher expected foreign earnings. In the quarter, as Phebe noted, we recorded a charge in discontinued operations for the settlement of the long-standing dispute with the U.S. Navy regarding the termination of the A-12 program. This charge reflects our agreement with the Navy to provide $198 million credit toward the design and construction activities on the DDG-1000 program. We expect that this amount will be expended through 2017 as the program progresses. This agreement puts behind us litigation that's been outstanding for over 20 years, and recall that following the Supreme Court's ruling a few years ago, we faced the prospective years of more costly litigation without the possibility of any upside beyond a walkway. The charge is shown net of the related tax benefit of $69 million for a net loss in discontinued operations of $129 million. A quick point on pensions. During 2013, we contributed approximately $600 million in cash to our pension plan. And for 2014, our funding expectation is about the same, just slightly lower, with most of that funding expected to occur during the third quarter. And finally, as Phebe alluded to, I'd like to address capital deployment in the fourth quarter. As you'll recall, our intent in 2013 was to deploy essentially all of our free cash flow in a shareholder friendly manner while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Through the first three quarters of the year, we were headed down that path and up to that point we had refunded 87% of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As we entered the fourth quarter, we got tripped up by a pension funding rule that constrained our ability to deploy any more capital through the end of the year. Under the funding rules of the Pension Protection Act, the substantial charges we took in the fourth quarter of 2012 placed limits on the amount of capital that we could deploy to shareholders. Once we hit the cap, any additional share repurchases or dividend payments would have to have been matched dollar for dollar with over and above contributions to our pension plan. This would have made any additional share repurchases highly inefficient given our planned pension funding profile and the timing of our recovery of pension contributions under our contracts. As a result, we refrained from executing any additional share repurchases in the fourth quarter after we hit the cap. At the end of the year, we sit with $5.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet and anticipate another year of strong cash generation in 2014. That leaves us well-positioned to embark on the capital deployment strategy for 2014 that Phebe outlined for you just a few minutes ago. Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan:  Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. [Whitley] (ph), could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Phebe, I had a question about the capital deployment that you just outlined, and I know it's a little bit more than one question because it's a little bit multipart, but if you're going to have an accelerated share repurchase program of 11.4 million shares in the first quarter, won't that reduce the number of shares for the full year right away, and so why would you guide to a flat with the fourth quarter number? And then just in general, can you talk about your thoughts about $5 billion on the balance sheet and what the right number for you to carry in terms of cash is?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So, we have built our plan like we did initially last year, and that is, assuming we cover dilution. We don't know the full effect of the cost or the timing of that, once we put in place the accelerated share repurchase. So, as we go forward, we will clearly adjust the guidance to reflect the impact of that plus additional share repurchases. So with respect to the balance sheet, we have accumulated a fair amount of cash, a lot of cash on that balance sheet, and we are very comfortable with seeking additional authority from our Board, both with respect to dividends and share repurchases. So we are mindful of that cash on the balance sheet, we fully recognize that that is not the best use of cash, and you will see us very actively this year returning a lot of that cash to our shareholders, keeping in mind that we cover and protect our debt rating. So, I hope that gives you some color.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan: Could you give a little more color on demand at Gulfstream? It sounds like you're pleased with the order intake in the 450 and 550 in the quarter, but maybe just give us a sense as to how far your backlog extends and how many deliveries you're planning on this year?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Okay. We are expecting 118 large-cabin deliveries and 40 mid-cabin. So, that's up from next year. Our fourth quarter, as you noted, Gulfstream was our strongest quarter in the past two years across all of our product lines and was particularly strong on the 450, 550 and 280. Going forward, our pipeline is robust which harbours well I think for our performance going forward. I think you can also – to think a little bit about where we are in our backlog, I think it helps to understand that the next available slot for the 280 is in the 9 to 12 month range, for the 450 and 550 in the 12 to 15 month range, and 650 in the 45 month range. So I think that gives you a little additional calibration. And you may have also noticed that we had a significant number of options in the quarter across all of our portfolio products. Consistent with our past accounting treatment, we did not treat those as orders. Let me tell you how it works. Where you exercise – when you exercise the option, then you get a slot and then we book the order with sufficient down payment. So we are confident in the reliability of these options but we are booking them according to our previous practices.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: With the latest budget deal, Phebe, I think we have a little better visibility at least into the total DoD authority on the top line, which seems to be flattish I guess through fiscal 2015. So based on your comments or in concert with your comments on Combat and on IS&T, should we look at calendar 2014 as the bottom for those businesses, and if you don't get the international order, then how do we look at Combat?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, okay, let me take that in two parts. It's really quite a blessing and a definite upside, both for our customer and for us to have some stability in program funding, reducing the uncertainty which is very, very difficult to manage to. So that is, the Congress are very grateful for their attempt to get back to regular order. Our programs, the Marine group, we're fully funded in anticipation of what we anticipated. Combat Systems, we received funding again in line with our expectations. And the same is true in IS&T. So all in all, I think we've got a pretty solid funding base. Now let's talk a little bit about the bottom, okay, because this is kind of where your – and I'll take that also in two parts. Let's talk about Combat. We believe we're almost there and that the major slide is behind us. Let me give you a sense of the internal dynamics of that group. Two of our three businesses have Army exposure, OTS and Land Systems. OTS has maintained very stable and consistent revenues. Land Systems, with its exposure to Army demand and combat vehicles, have seen their revenue decline substantially. On the other hand, we see increasing orders in Canada and the U.K. on the SV program. So, the Army is becoming a smaller source of revenue for us, and as I noted, we have significantly derisked our Army revenue for this year based on the experience we had with the Army last year and how they responded to the needs of the war and the available funding. So, one of the things I think that's important to understand is, these businesses are earnings and cash powerhouses. So, that gives me a lot of confidence that we'll continue to manage through whatever changes we have in revenue. But I think we're getting close to the bottom. Now, let me give you a little bit of context. I gave you the estimate for our international order of about $1.2 billion and I'll address that with you if that doesn't come-in in force during the second quarter, but let me tell you, I wouldn't have – based on last year's experience, I wouldn't have put it in this year if I weren't very confident that that is imminent on the horizon. And I think finally, just to add a little bit of textural context for you, if you think about GD at large, our Army exposure declined significantly during the course of 2013, which shouldn't surprise you given what happened on the Combat Systems side in revenue, from about 16%, and going forward for this year, across all of GD, the Army is now down to 10% which I see as another risk mitigation factor in thinking through our revenue. So IS&T, C4 is the primary business in IS&T that is affected by the exposure to the Army and we have again derisked that plan, and that's in part what's driving some of the revenue decline. So I think I've given you sort of a multifaceted answer.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: So, it sounds like it's this year, the timing could vary between the segments but…?
Phebe N. Novakovic: That's my view, and look, we learned – and this is new territory for both our customers and us in understanding how they were going to react to their funding pressure. So we have taken that learning and incorporated it into our thinking about sales going forward, and that's why we have derisked those plans.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: And you feel pretty good about tactical comms and the IT services area as compared to the ISR?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, so let me give you a little bit of color because implied in your question drives us to a related issue of the decline in revenue at IS&T.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Right.
Phebe N. Novakovic: So, first, let me say that last year was better than expected revenue year, right. We had predicted we'd be down about 5% and instead we're up 2.5%. So some of the decline we anticipated last year is showing up this year. Second, as I noted, we built an IS&T plan in which the majority of our revenues in the backlog have been derisked. So there's very little additional risk on the downside. Let me give you, to your question, a little bit of color by business unit so you can understand some of the changes. GD IT last year had a particularly great year in revenue as a result of their increases in the commercial wireless demand business and their call center operations in healthcare. So in 2014, we're seeing their revenue decline of about 10% come from the slowing in the call center revenue but a considerable slowing in commercial wireless, and I would remind you that our wireless business tends to be pretty lumpy. On intel, for our intel business, they're looking about at 10% revenue decline, which is largely driven by a mix across their lines of business that have more to do with the anticipated start times of new contracts. So where does that leave us? The real story here is in C4 where our revenues are declining by about a third. So let me help you think about this business to put this in some context. Think about it in four buckets, U.S. Army, Canada, U.K., and U.K.-based international. We held out pretty well in 2013 in C4 Systems because a majority of our sales were in our backlog, but the challenge is that the U.S. Army sales last year showed up in considerably lower volume in 2014 across our product lines, networking, communication and encryption. And it is in those lines of business that we have significantly derisked our plan going forward. Hence, part of the drive of the primary determinant of the third, 33%, reduction in sales. So, all right, that's that one bucket. As for Canada, our business is strong and I'm very optimistic about the future of the MHP program. We're very pleased that Crown has agreed to go forward with that program and we have a very strong and cooperative working relationship with our customer, Sikorsky. I also like how our Canadian commercial business looks. Finally, U.K. and international, you'll recall last year that we were pretty disappointed with the poor performance of GD U.K., and as a result we moved all the non-vehicle business under C4. Remember that Combat Systems, Land Systems in particular, picked up the SV program, which is where it belonged. And C4 has done a great job. It's taken cost out in stabilizing that business. So I think, to be just real clear here, there is considerably more upside here than downside on the revenues, but I would ask you not to get too far ahead of me.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Right. Well, that was tremendous color. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank:  Phebe, I wanted to go back to capital deployment for just a second. In particular, the 2014 cash flow that you'll generate, if you can give us some color on net income to free cash flow conversion? I know you tampered that expectation a bit for 2013, you overachieved it to the sort of 400% plus, just curious your outlook for 2014. And then, to 2013 you had committed to returning it to shareholders a vast majority and you're fulfilling that here in the first quarter. Is it the same commitment for the cash generated in 2014?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So look, I don't want to give you an exact cash number but I can tell you this. We anticipate cash for 2014 in line with our previous history. We may see some puts and takes on timing with respect to payments but we are – you'll see cash conversion that's very similar to our prior experience and our full intention to deploy almost all of that, not all, of that free cash flow to our shareholders. Okay?
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Yes, perfect. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
David Strauss - UBS: Following up on Myles' question, Phebe, could you maybe just address working capital and how you view that? I mean over the past couple of years, inventory has been a significant drag, I think receivables have been a drag as well. Just how you see the opportunity there to generate some cash out of working capital? And then on M&A, I know you took a break here in 2013 on the M&A side, but just how you're thinking about that relative to what you're committing to in terms of cash return to shareholders?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Sure. So, you may recall at the beginning of last year, I told you we were returning back to basics, focusing on operations. A key part of that focus on operations is a wholesome cash generation capability, and I think we've demonstrated that, and we do that by working our working capital hard and we've done that. We also had a great collection year. So, you'll continue to see us work our working capital. Each one of our business units is focused on that like a laser. So I'm confident that we'll do well on that regard. So M&A, look, I'm going to tell you exactly what I told you last year. I don't have anything on my horizon at present, and so I don't anticipate our behaviour with respect to M&A to be any different this year than it was last year. Okay?
Erin Linnihan:  Let's take the next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Phebe, I wondered if you might address, in just sort of a general commentary, I mean a year ago at this time you said you were very internally focused on the business, you did a good bit of restructuring, you moved some town around, you made some organizational changes. I guess from a high-level, how did things play out in 2013 relative to your plan and how are you thinking about 2014 and how might that be different? I mean I can appreciate you never really finish driving improvements in the business, but what sort of opportunities do you think will be created this year from the improvement you tried to undertake last year?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So let me take that in a couple of parts. Referring back to my answer in the last question, we had our back to basics which focused on margin expansion, ROIC, and good cash conversion, and I think with respect to each one of those metrics, we performed very, very well. We had 11.8% operating margins, 107% free cash flow, return on sales of 8% and an ROIC of 16.6%. So, wholesome directionally correct, and that doesn't happen without the blocking and tackling on operations every single day. So the team did a fantastic job living up to their opportunities and we're going to do the exact same thing again this year. We have talked to the management team about the need to continue to focus on doing well by our shareholders and creating value. So I'm very comfortable that you're going to see more of the same. To give you kind of a sense of where we are, and I think embedded in your question is, so kind of how do we see GD, right. So, let me give you what I think about the value proposition for us and let me explain it to you in this way. For me in my mind, Gulfstream is the primary growth engine for both earnings and revenue. Marine is the steady producer of earnings and cash with growing revenue at about 5% over the next few years. So, pretty good and pretty solid. Combat is a strong operating business, as is C4, but in both instances they are exposed to the U.S. Army. The rest of IS&T remains stable. So, think about this, let me give you a little bit of granularity on this one aspect. Only two of our 11 businesses are in a significant down cycle, Land Systems and C4, from Army exposure. So our imperative there as well as in the rest of our business is to extend our margins, we're going to reduce our PP&E and working capital to the minimum required to support our revenue and manage for cash. So that is – and I think when you think about the composition of the businesses within GD, I think that gives you sort of an overview of how I'm looking at it and how I bound the risk. Finally, I would add that international revenues are increasing from 25% in 2013 if you include, which I do, three FMS to 30% in 2014. So that again is another driver of the value proposition in GD. We don't make a lot of noise about our international sales but we have year-over-year improved that percentage. So I think – I hope that gives you a little bit of the color at 50,000 feet.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: No, it does. I just wondered if there was anything sort of lesson learned as you sit down and craft a set of plans again a year on in this year's plan and say, what do I wish I would have known or implemented last year that I didn't?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, so I think one is obvious, we were wrong about when our fairly large international order was going to happen. So, as I said, I wouldn't be forecasting that for this year if I weren't particularly certain that it was coming [indiscernible] I got in some places on this subject. But I think the most profound lesson learned here is that we had unprecedented and unforeseen behavior by our Army customer, all for good and valid reasons, but their reaction to the changes in their funding stream were not anticipated by us. So we've got a year of learning of that under our belt and that is why we have derisked our U.S. domestic Army exposure in all of our businesses that have that exposure. Does that help?
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed, sir.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: I wanted to ask a question about the G650 because I assume you just had a great year of margins at Gulfstream and when you go forward here, I'm assuming you still expect the G650 to be a strong contributor to margin improvement over time. But I'm interested in the timing, when you expect that to be additive to margins, can that happen in 2014, and how should we think about the margin trajectory for that program?
Phebe N. Novakovic: It's additive now. So in terms of clearly earnings, it's slightly dilutive to overall margins simply because we continue down our learning curve. And remember, last year we had a fairly lumpy learning curve on green deliveries because of the disequilibrium that I explained to you last year at this time on the 650 retrofit. But we're through that and we're continuing to see learning improvements on 650 green and on completions. So the margins are going to get better on 650 and I expect throughout this year and into next. I'm not going to give you a real good sense of what the terminal value may be of our margins on that. We don't know yet. So what we led you – what we've guided you to is what we see, what we anticipate in our 650 margin performance, and it's wholesome and it's improving as we would hope and expect.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: And as you move down that learning curve, you said earlier that the first slots are available about 45 months from now, presumably if you took rate up, you would move down even faster and you would have more operating leverage. I mean how are you thinking about that? 45 months is a long time to not add to a production rate.
Phebe N. Novakovic: So, as you well know on us, we set our production rates at the beginning of every year based on what we believe the supply chain can handle, what our manufacturing, the optimization of our manufacturing efficiency. So as we have factored all of that into setting the 650 production rate, and to the extent that we have any – if that time compresses between order and delivery, we'll notify our customers first of earlier opportunities, but I don't anticipate any significant time compression, at least in the near-term. And look, what we want to be able to do is plan our manufacturing green and delivery that are consistent and improvable and repeatable every single year. So we could pull through, assuming that supply chain could handle it, make that assumption, we could pull forward additional slots and production slots but that is not necessarily good for the long-term. I think it gives us a pop and a pop that's not necessarily repeated in the next year. So, when you're manufacturing complex platforms with a robust and diversified supply-chain, you want to be very mindful of what your supply chain can handle without driving up their cost, which then are reflected in your price. So look, this is a – there's not a year that goes by or even on a quarterly basis that we don't look at, have we set the right production rate, and we're very comfortable where we are now.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Is limiting factor here confidence in the longer term demand trajectory or is it getting part of your supply chain fully up to speed, and so you're comfortable with then being able to go to a higher rate?
Phebe N. Novakovic: We are very confident in the long-term prospects for this product. I think it's proven itself and we've seen increasing demand over time, because of all the niches that that product serves. You know, you've got to be careful when you start up a new line, both of which is tough [indiscernible] and this is a primary consideration that you structure your supply-chain. And you can't – the perturbation from a break in your supply chain is very, very difficult to recover from. So that's why we have thoughtful, predictable, managed production rate on the 650, but we are very confident in the demand profile for that airplane.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Please proceed.
Peter Arment - Sterne Agee: Phebe, I guess I just want to follow up on kind of Doug's question a little bit. First I guess maybe a clarification. I thought you mentioned that G650 green deliveries potentially doubled year-over-year. Was that for the full year or for the fourth quarter?
Phebe N. Novakovic: I think what I said was that we had a mix shift from – at least what I said in my remarks – was a mix shift from the mid-size deliveries. That was really one of the key factors. And then we had some increase in our – considerable increase in our 650 green deliveries but it was a little slower, you might recall that we had anticipated, because of that retrofit issue we have. So next year going forward, we see 650 production ramping up slightly, and that's one of the reasons for the margin performance in the fourth quarter, as we've got a whole – we have a number of deliveries across the board, across our portfolio in the fourth quarter really driven by, by the way, customer demands and preferences and then additional 650 green deliveries.
Peter Arment - Sterne Agee: Okay, and if I could just squeeze in related to that, just the question that I was trying to get at was, it sounds like the disconnect has been eliminated, especially between green completions that you talked about are essentially worked down quite a bit…
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes.
Peter Arment - Sterne Agee: And then going forward, the 650 sounds like it's back on what was its original plan, where we stop green deliveries would be modestly increasing [indiscernible] I think back in 2011, it was talked about at every 10 to 15 aircraft a year. Is it fair to assume that kind of we're back on that case?
Phebe N. Novakovic: We are but we're going to set our expectations based less on the past and more of our assessment of the future.
Peter Arment - Sterne Agee: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
Jason Gursky - Citi: Hello there, Jason, welcome to the earnings call. Just one quick clarification question and then one on Combat Systems. Phebe, you mentioned that the 450, 550 deliveries were down in the fourth quarter. Does that mean you were carrying some inventory into the new year that's going to get worked down, so that's the clarification question? And then I would love to, if you would, just a couple of extra minutes on the outlook for Combat Systems. First, what's changed, what gives you more comfort now on this international deal, so if you can just kind of qualitatively speak about why we're so close now? And then maybe a little bit of commentary about the opportunities and risks in other areas of Combat Systems that you see over the next couple of years. We've got some debate going on about the ground combat vehicle, this chatter about the potential cancellation of program up in Canada, so those will be risks, and I was curious if there are any other opportunities out there?
Phebe N. Novakovic: All right, let me try to get them in order and if I forget one of your sub-questions, you can remind me. Inventory, we don't have any on the 450, 550, we don't have buildup that we're carrying into next year. So let me give you a little bit of color on this international order. We are essentially done with the negotiations and we believe that we're going to move forward pretty quickly, but I am not about to get ahead of our customers here. But I can again reassure you that there is no way I would have put this into the plan had I not been confident that we wouldn't be repeating last year. So look, with respect to opportunities and risks, let's think about that. Land Systems, and again this is largely we're talking about Land Systems, Land Systems have opportunities both in Canada across the whole variety of programs that we were not even materially affected by Canada or affected at all by Canada's cancellation of that program. They also have increased revenue opportunities and earnings opportunities on the SV program in the U.K. Both are very comfortable with our performance on that program. GCV, we factored hardly at all into our plan. We've got Strykers factored into our plan at a derisked basis, reflecting how the Army executed the funding. Take for example what we used as our predicate is the funding profile for the third Stryker brigade. It kind of came in lumps, little lumps, as funding became available. The Army is dedicated to modernizing its Stryker fleet with these double-V-hulled that have enormous advantage in survivability of our troops in the event of attack. So it's a life saver for them literally and they are committed to making that happen. They're just going to have to execute funds as they become available. So we have assumed going forward that we're going to get lumpy orders and I think that's appropriate. Tanks, for our Abrams tank program, we got about 100 million in this last build that we're going to continue to work in U.S. and international orders to bridge Lima until – which is where, as you well know, we do the tank manufacturing – until the 2018 timeframe when the Army begins to or expects to begin their modernization effort. And by the way, with respect to that, I think that the loss of critical skills and the very high cost associated with the production break at Lima are very well understood, and I personally am very appreciative for the leadership and support that we've received this last year from the Congress. So I think that we have taken a very, very candid, realistic look at each one of our programs, and the ones that we think are vulnerable, we have had very, very, very small portion in our – our sales estimate represent a small portion, and we have adjusted our expectations on our more mature programs in line with our experience over how Army is executing its funds. Okay?
Jason Gursky - Citi: Okay, great. That's great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Looks like I can get two like everyone else, so I'll see what I can [ask] (ph). You have down revenues but you have up headcount. How do we square that?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, so here's the thing. Our headcount went up – and let me parse that for you – our headcount went up primarily because in the last few months, GD IT hired about 8,000 new employees to cover the ramp-up of the demand in the call center in their healthcare portfolio. And by the way, those are cost-plus contracts, so people equals revenue, right. So offset by that – and what that does is sort of camouflage the fact that we've had a 30% decline in our employment at those two businesses where we crossed actually, across Combat and within C4, of their employment. So, part of it is that we've got that smaller businesses but one of our business is adding a lot of employees to it. Okay, does that make sense to you?
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Yes, totally. And the other thing is, when you sort of gave us this outlook for the world for your business, you didn't include the benefit from either the ISR, if I'm correct, and also whatever else you might do. So how do you put sort of your EPS growth as part of the overall operating metric that you'd like either your business units or in fact the Board sort of ask of the officers of the Company? And then just balance that against ROIC, both of which are very important.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, so we are – we built our plan and I gave you the original initial guidance on where our EPS is based on, what we almost always do, and that is anticipate a share repurchase sufficient to cover the dilution, we didn't anticipate or we didn't put into our EPS estimate at this juncture what the results of the share repurchase are going to be, in part because we have to work out some of the cost structure and timing around that. So I think you can rest assure that going forward, probably even in second quarter, we'll give you an update of what was that looking like to us. So with respect to ROIC, as you know, we drive that, there are two components, the numerator and the denominator. Our business units are responsible for the numerator and in no small measure. Our corporate headquarters is responsible for the denominator. So we anticipate an ROIC improvement against our plan for the remainder of the year but there are an awful lot of moving parts here. I would tell you that we significantly outperformed our ROIC against our internal targets for last year. So I anticipate that the guys will get at it working hard, bring down working capital and increase [indiscernible], okay.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Thank you very much.
Erin Linnihan:  [Whitley] (ph), I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Please proceed, sir.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.: A quick one on Gulfstream. You're going to be up eight large aircraft, I assume that's got to be 650s, and that looks like it's at least 60% of the revenue growth and it has above average margins today and the margins are improving, and I assume the mid-size aircraft, the margins also are improving. How come the overall margins are down?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Largely, a question of the mix shift between the 450, 550 and new 650 and 280, and we're making a calculation about what we see in learning in margin expansion in those two new lines. Also offset in part by, as we talked about before, the significant increases in 450 cost as a result of some of our supplier – renegotiation of supplier contracts for major parts of that airplane. So, I think that Gulfstream has the opportunity to outperform but we're going to take that one step at a time. I would also note that while Jet continues to be profitable in 2014, the contribution is likely to be less as they ramp-up on some of their new revenues that they have in-house. So all up, I think we're looking at some margin compression but we'll work hard to outperform that.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.: Thank you. And a quick one on pension. How did you do last year in terms of investment performance and the discount rate because I would assume, given your heavy asset focus on equities, you would have had terrific performance, and given all of that, how come you still have to put $600 million into the plan?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Let me ask Jason to address that but we're going to put about $550 million in, but Jason, why don't you give some color on that.
Jason W. Aiken: Sure. Your presumption is correct. We did perform well in our returns last year. It was somewhere in the ballpark I think of 16.9% return. So we are very pleased with that. As you also alluded to, discount rates did edge up, so our funding status saw some significant improvement. The amount of contributions for the coming year are based strictly on the Pension Protection Act minimum funding requirement and that's what we'll stick to, is funding at those minimum levels for the foreseeable future.
Erin Linnihan:  Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2013 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Glenn, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Miss Erin Linnihan. Please proceed.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Thank you, Erin, and good morning. I am pleased to report that we had a very good third quarter, with revenues of $7.8 billion and net income of $651 million. We reported EPS of $1.84 per diluted share, $0.14 ahead of the year ago quarter and $0.03 better than the second quarter this year. This was also $0.16 per share better than consensus. So how did we get there? Revenue was 1.7% less than the third quarter 2012. Once again, however, revenue for each of our operating groups was higher than the year ago quarter, except for Combat Systems. The same is true for the first 9 months of the year. Revenue for the first 9 months is up over 2012 in our Aerospace, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups, but offset by a significant decline in Combat Systems revenue, leading the company down 1.4% for the first 9 months. The real story in the quarter, however, is the positive operating leverage achieved in the period. While revenue was down 1.7%, operating earnings were up 5.7% in the quarter, a clear reflection of positive operating leverage. This resulted in 12.3% overall operating margin. Net earnings and earnings per share were ahead of Q3 2012 by $51 million and 8.2%, respectively. The ratio of net earnings to revenue or return on sales was 8.4%. With respect to cash, we had $364 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter, about 56% of net income. We had $1.3 billion for the first 3 quarters, about 69% of net income. In Q3, we repurchased slightly under 1.6 million shares for $134 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased over 9 million shares for $718 million. In addition, if we add that -- if we add to that number the 2 dividends paid this year -- recall that there was no dividend in Q1 because it was paid in the fourth quarter of last year -- we have returned $1.1 billion of the $1.3 billion or 87% of the free cash flow year-to-date to our shareholders. Let's turn to segment reporting for the quarter. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a better-than-expected quarter with its highest quarterly revenue to date. Compared to third quarter 2012, operating earnings and margins were up $108 million and 290 basis points, respectively. Pretty strong. On a sequential basis, operating earnings and margins were both somewhat lower, as had been forecasted. Gulfstream margins were good and better than expected, but lower than last quarter for the reasons I provided during the second quarter conference call. Once again, we had good contribution from Jet Aviation, where they were operating at a loss a year ago. Our expectation in the fourth quarter is that revenues will be approximately the same as this quarter, but margins will not be as good. We will deliver 2 fewer large-cabin aircraft and will experience higher research and development costs with late [ph] scheduled launch assistance payments. We also have some program timing impacts of Jet -- at Jet on completions, all of which will compress margins. For the year, revenues will be consistent with prior outlook and margins for the group should improve slightly over prior guidance to the low-17% range. Combat Systems. Combat once again demonstrated the disciplined performance of a good cyclical, reporting 16.4% margin on revenues approximately 30% lower than the year-ago quarter. Land Systems and OTS had particularly strong margins on continuing cost reduction initiatives and strong program performance. ELS helped by returning to profitability in the quarter despite weak revenues. All in all, a really outstanding performance from an operating perspective. Compared to the year ago quarter, margins were up 240 basis points. Sequentially, revenue was somewhat lower, but operating margins were up 230 basis points. We do expect significantly higher revenue in the fourth quarter, but a drop in margins in our domestic business. For the full year, revenues should be 20% lower than last year and margins should be mid-14%, 10% higher than 2012 on a pro forma before charges basis. Marine group. Marine group revenues were higher than Q3 2012, but operating earnings and operating margins were down $16 million and 110 basis points, respectively, entirely as a result of the completion of the T-AKE program in Q4 2012. Nevertheless, operating earnings were good and operating margins at 10% were solid with good performance across each of our businesses. These are industry-leading margins. In Q4, we expect lower revenue and some very modest margin compression. For the year, Marine group revenues should be flat compared to the prior year and margins should be in the high 9% range. IS&T. IS&T remains a good news story from a revenue perspective. Revenues were higher this quarter than in Q3 '12 as well as the prior quarter this year, in a very tough market. Operating earnings and margins are up against Q3 '12 by $15 million and 30 basis points, respectively, and up $18 million and 60 basis points sequentially. This operating result was driven by improved performance at C4 Systems and AIS. For the fourth quarter, IS&T should see a bit less revenue than we had in the third quarter with a modest decrease in operating margins. There's still work to be done here but we are seeing steady improvement from an operating perspective. For the full year, IS&T revenues could be slightly lower than the prior year and margins should be in the high 7% range, consistent with prior guidance. Let me turn to our EPS guidance for the remainder of 2013. Last quarter, we increased our guidance to $6.85 to $6.95 of earnings per diluted share. We are again increasing our guidance somewhat to $6.90 to $7, assuming that there is no residual impact from the shutdown. We acknowledge that this quarter was better than anticipated and we are further along year-to-date than expected. However, I think our guidance, which is modestly increased, is not overly cautious and consistent with the current environment. In short, we had a great quarter and are hard at work trying to ensure that the full year will be beneficial for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. Erin?
Erin Linnihan: Now we will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Hugh Redd. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd: Thank you, Erin. Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'd like to cover the usual miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period. First, net interest expense was $22 million for the quarter versus $39 million in the third quarter of 2012. For 2013, we expect net interest expense of approximately $85 million. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects $129 million of net cash. And by that, I mean cash in excess of debt. This represents an improvement of $1 billion over the net debt position of a year ago. The effective tax rate was 31.2% for the 9 months of 2013, consistent with that experienced in the same period of 2012. For 2013, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 31.5%. During the quarter, we contributed approximately $370 million to our pension plans. And through the end of the third quarter, we funded over $500 million to our plans with less than $100 million left to contribute in 2013. Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to you for questions and answers.
Erin Linnihan: Thanks, Hugh. [Operator Instructions] Glenn, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I'm out at NBAA. And I wanted to focus on Gulfstream this morning. The Aerospace book-to-bill I think...
Phebe N. Novakovic: By the way, you and everyone else, I think.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Possibly, it actually looks a little quieter this year, but I think some of that's the timing in the quarter. I wanted to ask you, though, about the order environment. And I think we've been hearing that, for your platforms, order demand is fairly even across the different areas, across the different markets, but at a lower level. And this is reflected, I think, in the 0.6 book-to-bill. And we really haven't seen a 1.0 book-to-bill for a while here. So I was going to ask you if you can talk about the different markets. And we sense that maybe large-cabin is softening a little bit on the order side, but at the same time, mid-cabin may be getting a little stronger. How would you comment on that?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Look, I'm pleased with our book-to-bill, and I think year-to-date, we have -- important to understand that we've got 10% more airplane orders in units than we did last year. But let me give you a little bit of background here. That said, we are a few orders shy of planes in the quarter as against our plan. And I think this is interesting. The quarter started out very strongly, but closed slower with getting to contract taking longer. And I think, certainly, the domestic order activity has been impacted by the uncertainty caused by the government shutdown and debt ceiling deliberations in Congress. But at the same time, we've seen a year-over-year growth in emerging markets and the rest of the world. So that's providing us some stability in our order book. And by the way, on the domestic side, we've got a very strong funnel. It's just taking, I think, longer to get to contract in the environment of a considerable amount of uncertainty. We've talked about in the previous quarters that when thinking about Gulfstream orders, we need to consider the mix, right? So again, this quarter, Gulfstream booked orders for each of our aircraft, and the 450 and 550 constituted about 70% of those orders. So I always look at the order in terms of mix because I think that, that tells a pretty good story. So all in all, we've seen a pretty consistent increase in our mid-cabin 280 and across our large-cabin, and I don't see anything that materially changes that in the horizon that we can see.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So Phebe, just to close. On the 650, is it fair that because you're so sold out that the order environment is a little quieter there? And then the last part of the question is could you update us on the software development on that platform? It sounds like that is still progressing, but not quite where it needs to be.
Phebe N. Novakovic: 650 continues to take orders. So I consider that quite positive. And the software development, I think largely what we've had is superb operating performance of that airplane, and it's meeting and exceeding the users' expectations. We've still got some back end in terms of cabin software issues, and that's as much as user interface training and we need to make some changes, and really modest and moderate, so nothing that has been -- things that are a little bit of annoyance, I think, but quite rightly so to our customers, but nothing material. We're not concerned about that. These are normal and, frankly, far less sort of squawks that we've had in any of our other airplanes. So I think, that said, that 650 is really a game changer.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I wanted to continue on Aero. When I think back a little ways, you all had commented that ultimately you could produce the G650, given the operation -- basically, a much better operational design for costs that would be even less than the 550. And what I'm interested in is when you look at how this is going in terms of cost performance and production, how do you see that trajectory today? In other words, are you on the path that you had hoped? Is it more challenging than you thought? Where does it stand?
Phebe N. Novakovic: All right. Let's talk about that in 2 parts. First, green, green manufacturing. We have, as you know, a purpose-built facility, along with the fact that we designed for producibility. So both of those have improved our learning curve as we have continued to move green aircraft through our facility and through the line. So we're not at our optimal, you wouldn't expect that. In fact, I don't know where optimal is and we won't know until we hit it. And our experience is that no matter where we are in the maturity of our platforms, we seem to get -- we do get better and better and better. So with respect to green, we are in line with and even a touch ahead of where we anticipated we might be. But I think we talked about early on this year that we had yet to -- we had a disconnect between green and completion. So we have largely taken care of what I termed a disequilibrium between the 2, but we haven't gotten to a steady running rate on green -- or on completions and margins on completions. So that's going to take some time and have -- provide some upside, but it's going to take some time for us to work through that. But all in all, we're very, very pleased with the manufacturing process on the 650.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And when you look at completions, what is making that so challenging? Is this more challenging than perhaps you've seen on earlier programs, say, the 550?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Absolutely not in this stage of the development, right now. Now going back 2 quarters, yes, it was far more challenging because we had built up this backlog of green in anticipation for the flight certification, and then we had an awful lot of fairly expensive rework. But we're past that, we're through that. And so our experience now is frankly there's -- it's the completion challenges aren't as great as they were in the early days of the 450s and 550s or the 5s and 4s. But nonetheless, we haven't hit full stride there and we probably have a little bit ways to go before that happens. That's just normal learning as we come down various learning curves.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Research (sic)[Shapiro Research].
George Shapiro: I just want to push a little bit on your Gulfstream margin. I mean, that would imply like the fourth quarter's got to be like about 16%, substantially below this quarter on similar revenues, which would tell me there's maybe $25 million of these added expenses that you were talking about. So could you just break out how much of that you think is R&D and some of the other issues you mentioned?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Look, I think some of that is going to be available in our Q to the extent you can parse it. I don't really want to give you the eaches but let me give you just some general magnitudes. We have pushed R&D to the right as a normal part of -- as we've gotten into our development program. That will hit us in the fourth quarter. At the same time, launch assistance is an important part of our overall product development. And the launch assistance comes in lumpiness. So it's a little less in this quarter. So that's a fairly significant part of what's driving the margins down. In addition, we've got some timing issues at Jet, really fourth quarter, first quarter '14 kinds of issues, that are also having some margin compression. So in general, we're looking for margins in the close to 16% -- 15.7% range in Aerospace for the fourth quarter, as I've kind of articulated. And we're going to have a few -- fewer large-cabin deliveries, which is often what happens in the fourth quarter as we move around airplane deliveries to suit the needs of our customers. So it is a combination. You can imagine with a big business like this with a lot of moving parts, it's a combination of those items that I've already articulated.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about cash flow. It looks like you contributed a little bit more to the pension plan than I think you had planned. But in the past, you talked about being able to get to 90% of net income in free cash and then use more than 100% of that towards buyback and dividend. That would imply an awfully steep fourth quarter. And is that still on track, and what's going to change between now and year end?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So before I get into that, let me argue a little bit with the predicate. I don't recall ever saying that we would contribute more than 100%. That would require going into the balance sheet. And I actually was very careful not to say that. But I don't want to quarrel on that[ph] noise, but I do want to talk a little bit about -- and thanks for asking the question -- about cash and cash deployment in several respects. So first, I think you can see from our schedules in the press release that we have an increase in inventory and work-in-process. We are hard-working this because I don't like increases in working capital. And frankly, we're having trouble getting paid in a few instances. So we'll work through that, but it's affecting our free cash flow conversion. Second, we have higher pension contributions that we -- and we had planned those at about the $600 million level. Free cash -- we had expected free cash flow to be below 100% and anticipated around 90%. That was before the government shutdown and the latest crisis. And third, cash has been coming in late this year. I mean, we've been meeting our plan but it is coming in slightly [ph] later, usually the last day or 2 of the quarter and something we had anticipated -- or experienced in the first couple of quarters. But I think that this brings me to something that I'd like to share with you. I'd like to talk to you about the import of the brinksmanship on the debt ceiling and the shutdown, at least from my perspective. I think we should think about the shutdown in 2 phases for us. Phase 1 is DFAS and DCMA civilians were furloughed, execution on in-process invoice stopped. Phase 2, DoD calls DFAS and DCMA back to work, payment resumed. An extended phase 1 ultimately challenges liquidity. Simultaneously, this is no news to anybody, the government took the nation to the edge on the debt ceiling extension. And in my mind, we were forced to gaze into the abyss, where we saw the full faith and credit of our principal customer at risk. That was sobering and suggests that we need to be cautious with cash as we finish the year and move into next. And frankly, as I think about it, I think it is premature to assume that the conditions extend[ph] in October cannot repeat in January. It's entirely possible that we find ourselves an extended period of time trapped in Dante's first circle of hell. So I think all of that suggests that we need prudence and caution as we move into the rest of the year and the beginning of next year, until we can get a more stable plan from the government with respect to both the debt ceiling and funding for our principal customer.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: But most of those...
Phebe N. Novakovic: That's kind of how I'm thinking about cash.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Is that a timing issue, though, so that if something slips out of this year, it's just next year, because of the timing of that cycle? Or is there actually a change in the actual collection?
Phebe N. Novakovic: No. We're pretty much meeting our plan. But I'm mindful that we have seen some timing issues. They've all cleared, largely, within the quarter. But I think we're seeing slowdown in payments, certainly by our government customers and some of the customers for whom we are suppliers. So that just brings some caution. And there is nothing intrinsically, other than those things that I've mentioned, that will ultimately affect our cash generation capabilities. But it's largely a question of timing, not something that I'm alarmed at but something I'm watching very carefully.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So Phebe, the Gulfstream margin was very significantly better, even though you have this adverse mix shift more towards the 650 and away from the 450 and 550. Can you give us a little bit more color on some of the issues you laid out? For example, was -- launch aid was high or how big about and how big for the year? Was there sequential improvement in the productivity and the profitability of the 650 as well as the 450, 550, x the supplier price hikes? Was there sequential improvement in Jet versus the second quarter?
Phebe N. Novakovic: All right. Let me give you a little bit of more detail here. We had higher performance across all of our lines, at all of our new plane production lines at Gulfstream, with the exception of the 450 and a little bit the 550 because of some of those supplier costs. But x that, clearly, productivity increases. Second, we had one of our best service quarters ever in revenue and margin. So it's a very -- at Gulfstream, very strong service and margin performance there. And I talked to you a little bit about Jet because that's a very -- that's a good news story compared to where we've been. Think about Jet in 3 respects. First -- in 3 lines of business. First is their FBO and service business. Those have continued, since we've owned them, to perform very well and exceeding our expectations. Second is their maintenance business. And if you recall in the fourth quarter of last year, we sold or closed a number of our facilities in Europe, maintenance facilities. So our revenue was lower on maintenance, as we anticipated, but margins are up. So I'm very pleased with that. And then the big muscle movement has been all along with Jet completions. And I've been reporting to you steady improvement on our operations at Jet. That team has done an excellent job turning around what was a very troubled program -- or a very troubled line of business. And we are at profitability. Our order book has increased, our funnel has increased. And I -- but I'm very cautious about sales in the completion side because they're big and they're lumpy. And we need to approach that, as we do, with a fair amount of realism about the art of the possible, good terms and conditions, fairness and ability to meet schedule for our customers. But Jet is a good news story and that team out there needs to be commended. So all of those things -- and Jet, by the way, has been profitable every quarter this year. All of those elements combine to drive up margins, a little bit above where I had anticipated. But don't get out ahead of me in the fourth quarter, because we do have higher R&D. And by the way, we did -- you asked a question about launch assistance in this quarter, in third quarter, not material. But in the fourth quarter, it's going to be less and that's just a question of timing, nothing specific. All right?
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So when you say launch assistance, is this a payment that you make or a payment that is made to you?
Phebe N. Novakovic: In the Aerospace business, suppliers tend to contribute to the development of new products or refresh. We certainly do when we're supplying to Aerospace prime and on the commercial Aerospace side, and our suppliers do as well. That's nothing new. That's something that we've seen for the last 10, 15 years since we've been in development.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just over on the Combat business, sales have been obviously really kind of trailing off and were down 30%. There was a slight uptick in backlog, which was a very good sign. Just wondering if you could revisit your expectations on bookings, both domestic and international, what you're looking for there and the timing or the visibility or lack thereof. And even -- to the extent you're willing to do so, looking into next year or the next couple of years, where you think we're going to start to bottom out?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Okay. I appreciate this because I think this is an important question. As I go back and think about it, I explained to you all in January that we're going to work hard to make our order book, but I was uncomfortable giving you guys guidance around revenue, other than the most general, particularly in Combat. Because while we were going to work hard at revenue, we can't control it. And also, you may recall that the guidance I gave you was without regard to sequestration, let alone furloughs and the shutdown, all 3 of which has happened. So in a way, it's been, frankly -- it's no wonder that our revenue was lower. But I think this question deserves a little bit more clarity and detail, so let me give you that. Our sales are lower in Combat for 3 primary reasons, and I'll walk through each. First, most of the international orders we anticipated in the first quarter have not yet materialized and it's consistently slipped to the right. And clearly, without those, our sales estimates are going to be off. Second, we did not foresee the sharp decline in the military axle market as a result of the budget uncertainties in the Army and Marine Corps that have impacted both their force structure and equipment. And while MRAPs are remaining at some level within both of those services, they have been prioritized at a much lower priority as those services wrestle with the current environment. So we think that, as we can look forward, MRAP reset and modernization will occur in the future, but not at anywhere close to the level we anticipated. In my perfect world, in a sequestration-free environment, I suspect the outcome might have been otherwise, but that's not what we're facing. Finally and third, our U.S. Army customers' contracting activity is far slower than anything we had experienced to-date or anything we had anticipated. And I think that's because they're winding down 2 wars, rebalancing their budget, while unable to bring down personnel costs because of sequester rules. On top of which, they were whipsawed by the furloughs and shutdown. Their ability to contract has been pressured. So if you combine all of those, it's put a fair amount of compression on our sales estimates. That said, as you quite aptly point out, backlog for the quarter was up and our order activity was at about the 2012 running rate of about $1.4 billion and orders were twice the prior quarter. I don't want to get too far into the future because we are fairly early on in our planning horizon. But I will tell you that for the fourth quarter, we have included some of the large international orders, which should make up some of the difference reflected in this quarter's volume. But we are too late in the year to book enough sales to be in the range of our original plan. So sales for '13 are likely to be about 20% lower, at least under our current assumptions. I hope that helps give you a little bit of detail and color to parse through sort of what are the major muscle movements driving our sales impact.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: That is helpful. If I may just follow up briefly. Do you expect bookings -- where do you expect bookings to come in, in Q4? And where do you expect to end the year in terms of Combat backlog, if you're willing to give that?
Phebe N. Novakovic: I'm not comfortable giving the backlog, but I -- we anticipate several of those international orders which have -- I think I've been pretty clear and it's been obvious, have slipped to the right quarter-by-quarter. But the circumstances that we had, the marketing circumstances and the environment that existed in the first quarter are still here, it's just a question of patience, which is something I'm not particularly good at, but I am nonetheless required to be patient here. But we continue to see several of those orders coming in, in the fourth quarter.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can we go back to Gulfstream for a second? Phebe, I think you mentioned, in the quarter, you were maybe a couple light -- or a few light of your plan from an order perspective. And you also mentioned 70% of the orders, I think, in the quarter were 450, 550. The question really is can you give us some color on just the 450, 550 book-to-bill as you've seen it year-to-date? And would you actually have to see kind of better-than-planned closure of orders in the rest of the year to keep that production flat?
Phebe N. Novakovic: I really don't want to get into it, no surprise to you, but nice try asking, and to the book-to-bill by unit, because then I'll spend the rest of my time here in an exegesis on the various lines of airplanes we've got. But we've -- we have an order book and the funnel on the 450 and 550 have continued, and we see an uptick also in the 280. So everything that we see in our funnel and where we are in that funnel suggests that we just really need, on the domestic side, some stability coming from our government with respect to -- and the debt ceiling primarily, and the shutdown. But primarily, the debt ceiling, as we look at a lot of our domestic customers and they are a little wary. They're very interested. Interest is up across all of our lines, airplane lines, including the 450. And service revenue is up and continuing to look good, so far, into this quarter. So absent some exogenous force, like a real contraction in the U.S. economy, we're good to go on Aerospace.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: One quick one, if I could squeeze it in. The employees that you're carrying, the 95,700 that you disclosed in the quarter, you're one of the few, if only, defense companies that actually has grown the employment, certainly in the last couple of years. Is that completely isolated to Gulfstream? And what does that picture look like just in the defense businesses?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, this is actually one of my favorite questions because it's something this management team and I look at frequently. If you parse this down, it's a tale of 2 cities. Gulfstream has increased its sales -- or its employees, as you would expect. Marine group somewhat, as we've begun to gear up, and particularly on our research and development side that are cost-plus engineers. IT has continued to increase, based on their order book and their sales, but it is -- so that's the tale of 1 city. And then everywhere else, in some instances, we're down 50% of our sales force. So this has been extremely painful across some of our businesses. They've done what they needed to do to respond to the environment. But I'm very mindful of the human impact of all of this and it's camouflaged by that gross number. But you can imagine that we work this very, very hard, as I see this as the level of our overall productivity. But there's a lot of specifics embedded there that tell 2 very different stories.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just wanted to go back quickly to the Aerospace margin dynamics you outlined for Q4, and I wondered if you could help us think about what in that is temporary. You -- I think I heard you say that Q4 and into Q1, you expect the impact of the timing issue at Jet. But when you look beyond Q4 and into next year, is the R&D or launch assistance dynamic, does that play a material role in how we should think about the longer-term profitability? Or is there anything else that we should think isn't sort of temporary from what we're seeing in Q4? I guess the supplier renegotiation of 450, 550, anything like that.
Phebe N. Novakovic: It's temporary. Well, yes, so it's temporary on R&D and launch assistance, which tends to be kind of lumpy. And that, we will smooth as we plan for 2014. And I don't want to get too much into 2014. I suspect that the timing issues at -- on completions at Jet will resolve right away, quick. So that's nothing systemic. So when I think about the margin compression, absent what we talked about last quarter on higher supplier costs, there is nothing structural here going into '14. But as we go through our planning process, I'll have -- and on the fourth quarter call, I'll give you an awful lot more clarity about '14 and Gulfstream and margins and Aerospace in general. It's pretty typical of our planning process.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So it really just comes down to the margin performance differential between the legacy large-cabins and the improvement you make on the 650 at this point once you look out there.
Phebe N. Novakovic: That's right, and that's going to be mix. And we'll get -- as we plan through next year and we'll take a look at what our really incremental learning is down each one of those lines, we'll begin to estimate, but that's not where we are yet. Going back to, there's nothing really structural here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Well, the other surprise was IS&T. And in some ways, Phebe, could you -- you talked a little bit about the environment, but the business seemed to outperform the environment. Could you provide a little more granularity and where some of your successes are and where some of your challenges are?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So look, IS&T has done very, very well, and frankly, exceeded, I think, everybody's expectations, including mine. This team has worked hard. Without chasing revenues, they've held their own in a tough environment. That's across the board with AIS and GDIT on the revenue side. GDIT has performed very well on revenue and they're fighting their margins. As you know, that's a very tightly fought environment, but they're doing quite well. C4 has had an outstanding quarter with respect to margins. So let me give you a little bit of color on this. If you recall, as we entered the year, at the end of last year, we had 4 separate business units. We have now contracted to 3 in IS&T, because we, for reporting purposes, included GD U.K. within C4. And C4's margins have been very, very good, particularly in light of the drag out of GD U.K. And I think in the quarter, we have $11 million in charges out of GD U.K., and headwinds for and charges for the entire year-to-date at about $20 million, so very disappointing out of GD U.K., very disappointing. That said, we've got the A team in place there. Each one of those programs that we are participating in are strongly supported by our customer and by the team that we've got in place. So we're meeting the needs of our British customer, to which we're highly attuned and dedicated and have been for many, many years. This was just a prior management team that took its eye off the ball. And so we've got some cleanup. I spent a little time on that so you can understand the headwinds that, that entire group has faced in a difficult market on margins. So I'm very, very pleased with where they are. They've got a pretty good book-to-bill. We've had a steady order intake and we're really on the mend here. GDIT is quite a powerhouse, disciplined, mature management team, and I'm very confident where they are all headed. Does that help you?
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Well, just as a follow-up, I mean, this business in some ways probably has the most sensitivity to some of the turmoil you described with your major customer. How is it you've been able to do a little bit better? I mean, other than discipline. I mean, is it -- I mean, the Army, clearly with Combat, with its radios and so on, on one hand, you have that market on the other. There's elements of a withdrawal that clearly should be hurting. So maybe a little more granularity.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Okay. Let me -- Yes, sure. Let me help you -- try to parse that a little bit for you. C4 is the business with the largest exposure to the Army, not exclusive but the largest. The IT business has some exposure but we have reorganized in all 3 of those business units -- by the way, don't think that I think reorganization is a panacea to performance, but it's a predicate to improved performance in a down environment. So in IT, we've consolidated a number of the businesses to take -- lines of business to take advantage of growth in some businesses en masse. So they are accommodating. They're somewhat small and offsetting their somewhat small exposure to the Army. AIS has almost no exposure, in fact, none to the Army. So that leaves C4. And I think in that context, let me give you a little bit of color on C4's -- and maybe this will help you, on C4's programs of record. We've got WIN-T and that network clearly remains a priority. If you think about the Army historically, they balanced out force structure with capability. And that network allows them to do more with less. So we're fortunate to be the incumbent on this program of record. And we've been adjusting our business to deliver the capabilities in whatever deployment schedule the Army is on. So we've had a number of LRIPs approved year-to-date and we're continuing to perform on that network. And again, we size our business to the demand of the Army. On the rifle -- or on the radios, I think it might help you to give a little bit of program color there. As you probably know, we're the incumbent for both HMS Manpack and the Rifleman radios, which take our network capabilities from the WIN-T backbone and down to the individual dismounted soldier. And we're currently delivering on both products in the thousands of units. So I think that, that's important in understanding what's driving the underlying demand at C4. That said, C4 is completely restructuring its business in order to meet the current environment and -- which will, I believe, going forward, give it significant opportunities to further right-size itself and adjust to the demands of its principal customer. And by the way, not exclusive customer as we get outside the United States. So I'm very pleased with the agility of that particular -- or all of our businesses, but that business to recognize the environment they are in and take appropriate actions. So I hope that helps you understand.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Phebe, I just wanted to ask about the portfolio and whether you feel like this is the right portfolio or there's still some portfolio shaping to do either through divestitures or acquisitions. Just kind of update us on your view of the portfolio at this point.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, let me talk about acquisitions. I think I've been pretty clear in the year that we are and will be focused on operations. I haven't had any acquisitions on my horizon. I don't now and I'm not looking. So let's take that off the table. But with respect to the portfolio, my vision hasn't changed. And I've talked to you all about that balance in our portfolio. With respect to positioning, let's talk about that in a little bit more detail. In the platform businesses, it's pretty easy to see that we're the clear market leader with critical mass, right? But in the IS&T portfolio, it's a bit harder to discern who does what to whom when, simply because our businesses are each comprised of thousands of programs. So positioning in IS&T tends to be by line of business rather than by major programs. So what the IS&T management team and I look at to balance our portfolio, pretty much continually, is that line of business positioning. And no real shaping is required now, not of any material issue. I mean, we may take some paring here and there as we walk through and see what's core and what's not. But so far, steady as she goes.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Phebe, just a quick question for you. In the past, you've given us some idea of what the lead time is on your Aerospace models, in terms of when the next slot becomes available. I was wondering if you could give us an update maybe on the 650, the G450, 550 and the G280 on that basis?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, those -- each one of those -- well, 2 of those aircraft are legacy mature programs, right? And you would expect us to have some significant changes to -- in that environment as we go forward. 650 and 280 are brand-spanking new. So we would think about, in the normal course of business, refreshes, but I'm -- in a several-year time horizon. But I'm not going to get any more specific about that, since it seems to be high sport to what we're going to do and when we're going to do it. But I can tell you that our planning is very deliberative, it's not reactive. And when we announce an airplane, it's a real airplane and not a PowerPoint. So we're on track to do what we've always anticipated we would do, and we'll announce when we're ready.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: The 450, 550 lead time has come down from 18 months, which it used to be. We shouldn't be too concerned about that then?
Phebe N. Novakovic: No. We've got, I think, some availabilities about a year out and we'll continue to work that. Those are very efficient, highly scalable lines. So we've got enough in our backlog that we're comfortable. So I'm not particularly concerned about that. If that changes, we'll let you know. But we're looking at the late, late end of '14, early '15. So I'm still comfortable that, that's a pretty good margin. And then, as I said, particularly about our hedge, as I said particularly in this quarter, where we saw a little bit of softening in the domestic environment. And I think that's wholly attributable to the machinations in our government.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: A question, I guess, back on IS&T. I just wanted to dig in a little further. You're consolidating the GD U.K. and I appreciate the color there. When you think about the kind of the business lines, still 50% of the portfolio is on kind of the IT services side. Are there opportunities to kind of restructure or scale that if needed? I know you kind of look at it by lines of business, but maybe just some additional color there.
Phebe N. Novakovic: That management team has, in fact, reorganized to meet the current demand. So we've taken our units down from -- or the lines of reporting at the macro level from -- within IT, from 4 to 3, better streamline, reduce costs. And there, it's a daily fight across thousands of programs in multiple portfolios, from intel to each one of the services and beyond DoD into non-DoD agencies. So they are doing very well, I think because of their reputation and their cost structure, in winning more than their fair share of new contract awards. So I'm very proud of that management team. They're tough, they're mature, they're great businessmen.
Erin Linnihan: Glenn, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: And that question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So maybe more of a fuzzy question. We walked through a lot of details on a lot of the business units, so thank you for all the detail on that. Now that you've been sitting in the role that you have been for a while, what really has been, from your perspective, maybe some of the biggest challenges that you've had to deal with in the role of CEO over the last couple of quarters? I mean, when you were kind of preparing for the role and now that you have it, I mean, what has been the biggest challenges?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think -- it's interesting, I don't face these challenges alone, I face them with a management team. We spend an awful lot of time communicating among each other, as you would expect. And we have complete goal congruence. We are challenged in some of our markets by an environment, but I see that as an opportunity, frankly. In tough times, that's where you see human beings' character and their mettle and the strength of an organization. And GD is doing quite well, in my mind, managing what we can control. We're not going to lose a lot of sleep over those things that we can't control. But to the extent that we can control our operations, we're getting at it and getting at it hard. So I don't know that there have been any unique challenges. I think we've had a few curve balls as a country, frankly. I think we got a little bit further down the shutdown and brinksmanship paths than I think any of us, as Americans, would be comfortable for. But that wasn't idiosyncratic to General Dynamics, that's just, I think, at large. So I think that the challenges have been those that I expected, that we were going to see a little tougher environment. And that's the time when you differentiate yourself. So I've been very pleased with the management team. And it's about hanging tough and good leadership across the board. By that, I mean all of us, not just me.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes. And then if I may, just one follow-on, just one quick detail, I don't think you discussed too much about it. In the quarter, the margins in Land Systems were outstanding, right? I mean, they were just about, what, 100 basis points behind...
Phebe N. Novakovic: Combat.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, Combat, excuse me, yes, behind Gulfstream. Was there...
Phebe N. Novakovic: By the way, they're well aware of that.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'm certain they are. Was that team catch-ups? Or I mean, how should we think about it? And I was really like...
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, recall that we are not on team catch-up, okay? So look, this was the result of superb operating performance in that group. And as they continue to perform on each one of their programs, they've retired risks. And so this was really a really strong line-by-line focus on cost reduction. And I think that you've seen we anticipated this down cycle. I mean, we are in a cyclical business and we anticipated this down cycle and got out ahead of it with a fair amount of restructuring. So that's coming to fruition. The fourth quarter will see a little bit of margin compression. You haven't asked us, but I'll just give you a little bit of color. We've got the remainder of the ATP-OTS consolidation costs, which we will cover. It's the right thing to do and will put us in good position going forward. It's been clear, I think, from some of the press announcements, we've got a bit of mix shift at Land Systems as we move from mature programs into the double-V hull. And now, we're going to pick up some headwinds on that axle market. But in general, this is solid performance of a very good management team. And by the way, a lot of these guys lived through the last downturn, post the end of the Cold War. They know what to do. And that culture has, at both Air[ph] and Electric Boat[ph] , has permeated all of GD. Enough of my proselytizing, but that's what happened.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lacey, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Erin Linnihan, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you, Lacey, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter Conference Call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning. I am pleased to report that we had a strong quarter at General Dynamics with revenues of $7.9 billion and net income of $640 million. We reported EPS of $1.81 per diluted share, $0.04 ahead of the year ago quarter and $0.19 better than the prior quarter. This was also $0.19 per share better than consensus. Revenue, for all practical purposes, was the same as Q2 2012 and significantly higher than the prior quarter. Revenue for each of our operating groups was higher than the year ago quarter except for Combat Systems, which reached a recent high watermark in the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, Aerospace, IS&T and Marine were ahead of the first quarter. Combat was essentially flat with Q1. Operating margin was a strong 12.1% with good contribution and sequential improvement across all 4 of our groups. Net earnings and earnings per share were ahead of both Q2 2012 and the prior quarter, aided by lower interest expense and somewhat offset lower share count in part by a higher tax rate for the quarter. Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2013. Revenues are down modestly against 2012. However, net earnings are up over 1%, and diluted earnings per share are up 9% or 2.7 -- $0.09 or 2.7%. In short, we're off to a good start ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations. With respect to cash, we had $486 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter, about 76% of net income. We had $915 million for the first half, still 76% of net income. In Q2, we repurchased slightly over 6.6 million shares for $513.3 million. Recall that in the first quarter, we had $70 million of purchases that cleared and was reported in Q2. Similarly, we had $100 million of share repurchases in this quarter that cleared in early Q3 and will be reported in Q3 cash flow. For purposes of discussion, if we include that $100 million I just mentioned, we have repurchased over 7.6 million shares for about $584.5 million in the first half. In addition, if we add the Q2 dividend, you might recall that there was none in Q1 because it was paid in the fourth quarter of last year, we have returned $782 million of the $915 million, over 85% of the free cash flow year-to-date to our shareholders. Let's turn to the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I also want to give you some general perspective on outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and then close with our EPS guidance for '13. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a powerful quarter with the highest revenue, operating earnings and operating margins reported in the last 6 quarters. We had good contribution from Jet Aviation, and Gulfstream's performance was superb. Just to provide you a bit of color. Gulfstream enjoyed 170 basis point improvement over the prior quarter in G650 green manufacturing that more than offset a modest mix shift. Also, our 3 large-cabin models enjoyed a sequential 330 basis point improvement in outfitted or completions margin, a clear indication of progress on G650 completion. For the first half of 2013, Aerospace revenues are up $616 million or 19.2%. Operating earnings are up $171 million, 32.4%, a clear manifestation of Jet Aviation's return to profitability and the performance improvement at Gulfstream. This is all reflected in the 180 basis point improvement operating margins for the first half of the year versus the first half of 2012. This was really outstanding. But as I previously said, we don't expect the third quarter to be this strong for 3 reasons: First, we will experience cost increases on several G450 and G550 supply contracts, which will compress margin. Second, due largely to the vagaries of production planning, we plan to produce 2 fewer large-cabin aircraft in the third quarter. Third, we are delivering more green mid-cabin in the quarter, resulting in a mix shift in delivering the lower-margin airplane. Our expectation in the fourth quarter is that we will return to Q2 production levels and improved learning on the G650 line should offset somewhat the cost increases in the 450 and 550 supply chain. Combat Systems. Combat demonstrated the disciplined performance of a good cyclical, reporting 14.1% margins on revenue, almost 28% lower than the year ago quarter. Land Systems and OTS had particularly strong margins on cost reduction initiatives and program performance. ELS was impacted by an additional restructuring charge of $18 million that was accelerated into the first half. On a pro forma basis that is not considering the restructuring charge, Combat operating margins were 20 basis points higher in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2012 and 140 basis points better than the prior quarter. All in all, a strong performance in a tough market environment. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenues are off 23.6% against last year, but operating earnings are down only 17.5% on 110 basis points of improved operating margin. And as I said, the performance of a good cyclical. In the second half, we should see an increase in revenue and a boost to operating margins as ELS returns to profitability. Its restructuring charges are complete. Marine group. Marine group revenues were higher than Q2 2012 and the prior quarter. However, operating earnings and operating margins were down 2.7% and 100 basis points, respectively, entirely as a result of the completion of the high-margin T-AKE program in 2012. Nevertheless, operating earnings were up 11.9% sequentially and operating margins at 10.1% or 30 basis points higher on good performance across each one of our businesses. For the first half, Marine group revenues are up $127 million or almost 4% and operating earnings are down $31 million or 8.4%, solely attributable to the absence of T-AKE profit. In the second half, we expect revenues to approach the first half. Margins should be slightly lower. IS&T. IS&T is a good news story from a revenue perspective. Revenues were higher this quarter than in the second quarter 2012 as well as the prior quarter in a tough market, primarily with respect to our Army customer. The revenues of each operating unit within the group improved sequentially. Operating earnings and margins are down against second quarter 2012 by $28 million and 100 basis points, respectively, but up slightly against the prior quarter. The operating result was driven by poor margins at C4 Systems, primarily attributable to the expenses in the U.K. business that is now embedded in C4 Systems. We expect stronger C4 margin performance in the second half. The story is much the same for the first half. Revenues are up $29 million, less than 1%, but operating earnings are down $61 million, 13.7%, for the reasons I just noted. For the remainder of the year, IS&T should see a little bit less revenues than we had in the first half with earnings up somewhat and a modest increase in operating margin. Let me turn to our guidance for the remainder of 2013. The guidance I gave you at the beginning of the year of $6.60 to $6.70 per diluted share did not include the impact of sequestration, if any. The enactment of the 2013 bill went a long way towards stabilizing our program funding and mitigating some of the uncertainty for 2013. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we are increasing our guidance to $6.85 to $6.95 of earnings per diluted share. The lower end of the guidance anticipates our current understanding of the impacts of sequestration in 2013 and a CR for our fourth quarter. If sequestration's impact this year becomes more draconian than we can currently envision or a CR is implemented in a more rigid fashion than we can anticipate, we will revise our estimate. The upper end of the range anticipates that the impact on contract execution from furlough actions affecting our customers is mitigated as the year progresses. So in summary, this guidance implies that EPS for the second half will be similar to the first half in a range between $3.42 to $3.52 per diluted share. The fourth quarter should be the stronger of the 2 quarters. I'd now like to turn the mic over to Hugh Redd, our CFO.
L. Hugh Redd: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning, everyone. Net interest expense was $18 million for the quarter versus $37 million in 2012. For 2013, we expect net interest expense of approximately $85 million, reflecting the full year impact of our 2012 debt refinancing. At the end of the quarter, we had $151 million of net debt, down about $460 million from year end. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.1% and 31.5% for the 6-month period. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate approaching 32%. We expect cash contributions to our pension plans to approximate $600 million for 2013 with over 1/2 of that to be contributed in the third quarter. Erin, that concludes my remarks.
Erin Linnihan: Thanks, Hugh. [Operator Instructions] Lacey, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit more about Gulfstream and the outlook for the demand, particularly in the mid-range area and what you are seeing both domestically here from a demand perspective, as well as internationally?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Sure. Interestingly, our book-to-bill was the same this quarter as the year ago quarter, and Gulfstream booked orders for each of our aircraft in the quarter. 80% of our large-cabin orders were for 450 and 550 models. So if you think about the half, about 50% of our orders on large cabin were 450 and 550. We also increased sales of our small to mid-cabin aircraft over the first quarter. And overall, in the half, orders increased 30% -- 37% [ph] from a year ago. The U.S. market, by the way, led this order increase. And I'd say, in general, our order book is holding up very well. I like where we are in our geographical distribution. I like having some balance as a way to manage risks and mitigate overexposure to one market. So we're -- our funnel is robust and we are turning interest into orders.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a quick question on the Aerospace margins and the impact you outlined in your prepared remarks. Can you help us understand, one, just kind of the magnitude of how this is going to impact the margin rates in Q3 just in, I guess, general terms. And then two, help -- give us some color on why it is that we have renegotiations that are taking the prices up with suppliers on programs that otherwise I would think are pretty mature. It would seem somewhat odd to be negotiating prices up on really mature platforms.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, this seems to be an issue or a question that many of you have. But the fact of the matter is that on the 450, 550, we have renegotiated a series of contracts. And in some instances, we are paying higher prices as material costs go up and labor goes up. So we need to offset that through performance. I think that, that's basically just the law of economics as we think about our supplier base. I will tell you that this is not a onetime payment, that the increase will last the life of the contract. So as a result, we do expect margin compression in the second half. And it will be partially offset as we -- in fact, wholly offset as we move forward and move down our learning curve, also on both the 450, 550 and 650 and 280. I will tell you that the first quarter -- the first half performance in productivity in Aerospace was just superb and well above our expectations. I did give you some granularity on what's happening with respect to the increases in supplier contracts from 450s and 550s. We do plan just because of the vagaries in production to produce 2 fewer aircraft, large-cabin aircraft, in the third quarter and we're going to grow our green aircraft deliveries in the third quarter for the mid-cabin, which is going to cause a mild mix shift. So as we come down our learning curve from 650, 280, that pickup will offset in part the higher supplier costs on legacy cabin models. So while some of you may find it difficult to understand why it is that we have increasing prices, I will tell you that, that's often the case despite the maturity of the program. Costs do increase.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So is it safe to say that the margin rates we saw in Q1 and Q2 are both unattainable in either of the quarters in the back half?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, I don't think we're going to -- we are not going to see those margins for the same reasons I explained as we get the impact of some of these other changes. All wholesome, by the way.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Phebe, I'm interested in -- on the G650. Given the strength you're seeing with Gulfstream right now, how do you look at the production trajectory for that? Do you see a place soon where you would start to take rate up to meet demand?
Phebe N. Novakovic: As you know, we plan our production every year at the beginning of the year, late in the fourth quarter. And for '13, our production rate is set. We will look at our '14 production rate later this year. I will give you a little bit of color on the 650. We look at our learning curves in productivity on each one of our airplanes every quarter. And we had a significant improvement in green, and most importantly, completions margin in the second quarter on 650 as Gulfstream worked through that disequilibrium I talked to you about before between initial and final phase production more quickly than we had anticipated. And if you think about it, as a result of working through that disequilibrium faster than we thought, we saw a step function improvement in our learning that's just not normal learning. As we move forward, we won't see that kind of learning on a steady-state basis. So I hope that gives you see some additional color.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: But one thing I wondered is, in the past, we've heard that you're sold out for roughly 5 years on the G650, which seem to imply at least some sort of a rate plan farther into the future. I just wondered, given what you see in demand out there, if you're feeling the pressure to try and take that up if you can handle it from an operational standpoint?
Phebe N. Novakovic: We will set our production rate based on our supply base, what we believe that we can produce effectively and the needs of our customers. And that's all I'm going to say. For the remainder of this year, it's set. And we'll give you at the end of this year or I guess the beginning of next year, we'll give you some color on '14, okay?
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: A question about CS. The revenue dropped off. It was quite substantial and I think that probably steeper than we had anticipated. Was there anything in the quarter that maybe didn't play out as you anticipated in terms of volume? And then related question, you announced a rather large order from Germany for the EAGLEs. Can you help us size that contract, maybe talk about how those vehicles are going to deliver?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, let me explain our -- when I spoke to you on the fourth quarter call, my projections about revenue at Combat Systems were based on in anticipation of a series of large international orders that have slipped to the right. I think that I have demonstrated my inability to be an accurate prognosticator of timing on international orders, so I'm not going to walk back into that. But I will tell you with respect to the international orders, the circumstances that existed when we first talked to you about them are still extant today. It's simply a slip to the right. So as I think about Combat, clearly their first half is affected by the lack of these orders and there are multiple orders slipping to the right and we have anticipated that they will come in, in the latter half of the year. But as you would expect, the later they come in, the more of an impact they'll have on revenue. I would tell you, however, that we do not anticipate any material impact on their earnings -- in Combat Systems' earnings for the year as a result of that slip.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And with respect to the EAGLE contract with Germany?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, so we had a nice win there, but the customer has asked us not to disclose the funding levels, so I don't intend to.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Phebe, could you talk a bit about the margin potential at Gulfstream for the full year? I know you've -- we're given the previous guidance and you kind of haven't updated that other than to say it's going to be down in the second half. But I think the prior guidance was about 15.5%, 15.6%. And likewise, as you look to the EPS guidance for the full year, does that contemplate cash deployment in the second half in terms of share repurchase?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Answer your second question, no, it does not anticipate share repurchases. And with respect to your first question, we are going to release our Q shortly after the call, and you'll get more color on the segment-by-segment guidance. But suffice it to say, we're going to be above in Aerospace about, I would guess, around 100 basis points.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And cash flow for the year, the net income conversion, do you anticipate getting to a full net income conversion this year? And if not, is it a temporal issue that goes back in '14?
Phebe N. Novakovic: We anticipate, given our current plan, a free cash flow of about 90% of net income. And frankly, our cash will be determined by the timing of the large international orders. But I factored those in, in the second half and I'm looking at about 90%, could be higher.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Wanted to ask you about Combat Systems and understanding what you just said about prognosticating on international orders. But let's talk about Abrams for a moment. And if you could give us an update on how much longer your U.S. funding lasts and where potential international orders can take that program and how long major potential Middle East orders could sustain it?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So let me give you a little bit on Abrams. We continue to see congressional support, coupled with our international sales, as a bridge to Abrams' modernization. And that's really how you have to think about the tank line, is that we are currently in a bridging scenario where we will bring in international orders and maintain the lowest possible level of individual tank units to keep that line open, hold our industrial base viable and keep the talent in place. So the bottom line is we're almost there to bridging to the future. We talked to -- I believe that the Abrams modernization is now a '16, '17 -- fiscal year '16, '17 event and we're almost there. We just need a little bit of help from Congress and the international orders. I'll tell you something interesting. Congress, for almost 30 years, has been there to support America's Army in times of budgetary stress. And I have to tell you that had they not done so in the past, I kind of shudder to think what the recent hot wars would have been like without the Abrams tank.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So Phebe, with the size of this potential order that's out there, very massive, in fact, couldn't you go above the minimum levels?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Clearly, I guess we could, but I'm simply telling you what the strategy is. We want to maintain the minimum levels as our baseline. And then the more volume we get, the better it is for the workforce and the industrial base. And we need to be there for when the U.S. Army needs us again, and they will.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And just lastly since it was your old segment, just could you give us color on what happened with the DDG 51 award and how -- I think that went the opposite of the way it might have gone previously?
Phebe N. Novakovic: The lower bid, bidder won 5 ships, Bath won 4 with an option. So as you can imagine, we're very focused on our competitiveness at Bath, our cost structure and our build efficiency. We can -- we intend to continue to improve our performance and drive our costs lower. Because at the end of the day, we need to provide stability for our workforce and the lowest ultimate cost of destroyers to our customers with the highest profit margins in our market and that is all achievable.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So Phebe, in the IS&T segment, which is still your largest segment by sales, I think, seem to be stabilizing quite a bit after a pretty tumultuous period last year, particularly in the second half. Sales have stabilized, margins seem to have stabilized sequentially and you're indicating margins are going to be up a bit in the second half. Also, backlog is stabilized. Take a step back, this used to be a 10%, 11% business for a very long period and now we're down in the 8% range. As things have stabilized, how do you view the opportunities going forward from getting margins back up to double digit?
Phebe N. Novakovic: We are, as you can imagine, restructuring our business. And let me give you -- in order to maintain our profitability and increase our profitability, but let me give you a little bit of color on what's really driving our IS&T at the moment. Our book-to-bill for the group is 1:1, and frankly, this is -- we've had 6 consecutive quarters of greater than 1:1 or close to 1:1 book-to-bill. So it looks pretty stable to me. You also may recall that at the beginning of the year, we reset the plan for IS&T and we're focused on earnings and cash. And I expect to see the benefits of that accrue partially toward the end of this year. And then going forward, we have some margin expansion opportunities across all of our businesses. One of the things that's driving, I think, our market is that the decline in tactical communications seems to be behind us. So we've got the revenues -- we've got revenue that's both stable and sustainable. I would also note that for '13, we have sufficient backlog to support our outlook. So going forward, we are focused on taking costs out of our business, stabilizing our workforce and we're holding our own in a tough -- in fact, we're more than holding our own in a tough environment. But this is a margin improvement story over time.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So structurally, given the mix here, do you still think it's a realistic target ultimately, not talking short term, but ultimately if mix doesn't change from here to get back to that double digit?
Phebe N. Novakovic: It's certainly our objective. One of the things that's constraining us right now is a restructuring that we're doing in our U.K. business. And once we get through that, that'll take some of the headwind away from -- or remove some of the headwind that we're currently facing. That's going to take us through the remainder of the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Phebe, 6 months ago, when you took the CEO role, you set out a fairly firm view on acquisitions. I was wondering if that has changed in any way and whether you see the potential for any acquisitions going forward, particularly if we start to see the defense industry consolidating in this budget environment?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Let me talk to you about that just briefly. I have consistently said that our focus this year is on operations, that I've got nothing and have had no targets on my radar screen and that M&A is not a focus for us this year. That said, if we think conceptually about the future, I think it makes sense to maintain a strong balance sheet with the budget uncertainty we are facing and as you quite rightly point out, we want to have the capability to be opportunistic with a strong balance sheet in an industry that is likely to experience some consolidation. But at the risk of being a broken record, I'm working on our operations and I think that the team's results are obvious. So I think that kind of tells you where we are.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I mean, I guess related to that last question, you certainly have never really run the business with $3.7 billion worth of cash on the balance sheet. So what is the right number in terms of the cash? And if you in fact are able to get to 90% of your net income, that's only going to grow. So at what point does that cause you either step up the buyback or start to think about external growth opportunities?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, again through this year, I've told you and others that we expect to deploy almost all, if not all, of our free cash flow to share repurchase and dividends. Going forward, I've just explained the value proposition, we'll continue to use free cash flow in shareholder-friendly ways and maintain that strong balance sheet to give us flexibility. I just think that's prudent. It's prudent in 2 respects because we believe we can grow this business by being smart in what we acquire, number one. And number two, there's a fair amount of uncertainty. So in a period of uncertainty, you need to keep your powder dry. But that's not where we are this year. And when we get into next year, we'll begin to talk to you about how we see our positioning for next year. But right now, I got nothing on my radar screen and we're really focused on our operations. As you well know, we had some work to do and this team is doing it.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just wanted to circle back on Combat. So we've been chasing this Combat down for the last several years, declining faster than the guidance has been. The business is now, you take the last 2 quarters, it's about a $6 billion run rate business from a sales perspective. Just Phebe, thinking about the international pipeline versus what's going on the domestic side, could this -- looking out over the next couple of years, could this drop below a $6 billion a year business in terms of revenues?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Let me be a little quarrelsome with you about the predicate embedded in part of your question. We are not guiding you to revenue. And I think what I've tried to tell you is we've got to manage what we can control and it's not revenue. So our job is to be a good cyclical, particularly in Combat Systems. And that's to drive costs lower than revenue declines, and we're doing that. We will continue to do that. Going forward, we have a sufficiently-- a very large and robust pipeline of international orders. And when they enter into our backlog, it will largely determine what the growth profile on the revenue side is. But we're going to fight our margins and I think that's how you have to think about it.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So help me understand Gulfstream. I mean, you kind of said margin, 16.5%, which implies a pretty big step down in the third quarter. How much is the supplier change? For example, what percent of G450 manufacturing costs do these contracts represent approximately? And does this new contract impact start beginning of the quarter, middle of the quarter and -- so we can get some better understanding of how a big a deal this is.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think I've given you all the color I plan to give you on the supplier contract. I told you this is not a onetime payment and I'm not going to parse the margin variances between the supply chain cost increases and our production rate decreases on our large cabin and the increases in our mid-cabin. That's just not something we're going to report on. But we will work our way through that. And what I've tried to do is give you a sense that the first quarter was very, very strong. And we're going to see some margin compression in the third quarter; and fourth quarter, we're going to improve.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So just when you say you're going to be down 2 units in large biz jets, is that versus the 30 you did this quarter or the 28 you did last year?
Phebe N. Novakovic: That is versus the first half.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: You'll be down? I thought...
Phebe N. Novakovic: In other words in large-cabin production in the second quarter, we're just -- because of the way our production planning goes, we are producing 2 fewer large cabin and that is another factor impacting the margin in that quarter.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Phebe, I want to go look at this Gulfstream a little different. In the second quarter, you had 29% incremental margins year-over-year and the same sequentially. How much of that, do you think, is due to kind of what you talked about as your onetime step down? So what would be a sustainable kind of incremental margin? And I've got a second one. If you looked at just the 450 and 550 in terms of its book-to-bill in the quarter, was it about 1, similar to the first quarter?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Look, our 450 and 550 orders are very strong. As I told you, that's about 80% of our large-cabin orders and for the half about 50% of our orders. So those 2 lines are holding up very, very well. You asked about the incremental margin. We -- as I explained to you in the fourth quarter call, we had this buildup in working capital of green airplanes that we had to push through the snake, this bubble -- we had to push through the snake of completions. And we devoted an awful lot of resources to fixing that problem. And frankly, we fixed it much faster than we anticipated. Hence, my comment about the step function improvement in margin. I don't think it's prudent to kind of prematurely pinpoint what our gross margins on each -- any of our airplanes are going to be going forward, particularly the 650 it seems to be of great interest, or when they will achieve it. But we'll continue to come down that learning curve, both in the green production and most importantly, from my perspective, in completions. We don't have enough experience yet to know what a running rate, a steady-state running rate is going to look like on completions on 650. But we have made a step function improvement and we're very proud of the Gulfstream team for working through what was a difficult operational challenge.
George Shapiro: But I would think that the incrementals would at least be something north of 20%. They wouldn't maybe be 29%. Is that a fair statement?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Now George, I'm just not going to get into the variances with you. I think at the end of the day -- I'm sorry, but at the end of the day, just take a look at where are -- I've explained the big muscle movements and where our performance has been and where it's likely to go. But Gulfstream is poised to continue to do very well. This is like almost all of our businesses. We continue to learn unit-over-unit. And that's important to maintaining your profitability. That's just operating leverage and I like it.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Question on -- my question really is on Aerospace on the services side. Phebe, could you just give us some more color on what you're seeing in terms of the overall services environment, both kind of North America and also just thinking about the Jet Aviation business, how that is performing and what you're seeing on an international basis there?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, let me take your -- you've got 2 questions just embedded. First, let me talk about services and then I want to give you guys a little bit more detail on Jet. Our service revenue was technically down year-over-year because we sold, as you may recall, several underperforming Jet facilities late last year. But with respect to Jet, their second quarter was better than their first quarter in services and the third quarter so far is also improving. Service activity was particularly strong in the quarter for Gulfstream, which posted its, interestingly, its second highest service revenue quarter in the last 6 quarters and the third quarter looks pretty good, too. That's particularly noteworthy since we had seconded service staff to the completions challenge on the 650. So very, very strong performance. I would also point out that earnings on service increased a bit over the prior year quarter and in the first half over the first half of 2012 on lower volume. So I like where we are. Let me give you a little bit more details on jet because this is a good news story. Jet was profitable in both Q1 and Q2 of this year. And each line of their business was profitable, and we expect it to remain so going forward. And I thought I might give you some detail on Jet's lines of business. Their FBO business is at the high end of this market. Service business, as you well know, is volume driven, but Jet has good margins compared to its competition, particularly for not being an OEM. But the potentially high-margin business is completions where we had struggled for sometime on our operations, particularly in the high value-added wide-body completions market. So we have devoted a lot of our sales activity and orders in completions have picked up, so -- but more to come on Jet. They've turned the corner and they were a nice contributor in both Q1 and Q2 to Aerospace and I anticipate that they will be for the remainder of the year.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Bill Loomis with Stifel.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: On IS&T, it's certainly done well considering the environment. But can you kind of break it down as best you can. You mentioned that tactical products continue to be firm and appear to have bottomed out. So if you -- can you give us some direction on what type of growth you're seeing and kind of outlook for each of the major parts whether it's -- however you wish to break it up, tactical products versus IT services versus ISR just -- so we can understand the 3 major moving parts there.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, so our IT services business is just under 50% of our revenue. And they're seeing some really nice revenue increases, both in their defense businesses, their Fed/Civ exposure in their commercial markets. Our ISR business is continuing to grow slowly and they had a very good quarter for margins. Our tactical communications business was the one that -- the one line of business that we have that was particularly affected by its exposure to the Army, but as I mentioned that has stabilized, that it can be a very strong margin performer. And as they restructure and embed the U.K. business into their business, they've got some upside. I would tell you though again that the backlog is there in each one of those 3 lines of business to support our outlook for the year.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I want to talk about risk because I think you've been consistently talking about managing it and trying to eliminate it where you can. Sort of 2 questions related to that. One is do you have -- can you talk about any red programs and/or the process you go about in terms of eliminating them or removing them? And then second, as you sort of think about this plan that you've articulated for restructuring the business, how much of it is just going to be a way of life going forward and how much of it's like there's some big milestones and we've accomplished some things and you can feel satisfied when '13 is over?
Phebe N. Novakovic: I don't think that a high-performing business is ever done trying to improve itself or shoot for additional operational excellence. So I anticipate that we will continue to look for ways that we can improve our profitability, and frankly, provide low-cost products to our customers, which in a declining market revenue environment can be sort of challenging. With respect to any consolidations, we did announce the consolidation of our OTS and ATP businesses. You didn't ask this question, but I think it's important to understand our margin story for the year. We will cover those consolidation costs with realized savings in this year with no material impact. What that does for us is position us nicely going forward for additional margin expansion. Recall that this is a fairly easy business to-- relatively easy business to integrate given that they've got a number of complementary programs, and in several cases, the same customers. So I think that, that made a lot -- that was a logical thing to do as we were going through our operational reviews and we're looking to improve our profitability and service our customer with a -- it was a logical outcome. You talked about -- let me just mention one other thing, too. As I noted several times or alluded to, we did restructure our U.K. business. And I think that was important to ensure that we can continue to meet the needs of or U.K. customer. So we're well on our way to doing that. And of course, all of these restructurings are difficult. You asked a question about risks and I think I've given you, over time, a pretty good sense of how I see the risks overall. But we have no material red programs. We have programs that we'd like to have performed a little bit better, but our business units know what they are. I think the best -- I think that we talked about this on the last call, the best antidote to a budget cut is performance. And I would note that bears eat the sick and the young first. So I am -- we are very focused on maintaining our good execution on each of our programs because without that execution, you become more vulnerable. So I mean, with a $31 billion business and literarily thousands of contracts, they're likely to have a few that aren't performing up to expectations, but there are none that are a red program.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2013 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sue, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Erin Linnihan, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you, Sue, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' First Quarter Conference Call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Thank you, Erin. I hope to be reasonably brief this morning. The press release and related charts are pretty straightforward and tell a rather compelling story. We reported revenues for the quarter of $7.4 billion, operating earnings of $824 million and overall operating margins of 11.4%. This resulted in diluted EPS of $1.62 compared to consensus of $1.50. Free cash flow was fairly strong across the business, particularly for a first quarter, at $429 million or approximately 75% of net income. This was considerably better than the cash performance in the first quarter of 2012 and considerably more than we had anticipated in our plan. Given the defense market environment, this quarter compares favorably with the first quarter last year. Revenue is down modestly 2.3%. Operating earnings are essentially flat. Margins are up 10 basis points. Net income is up $7 million, and diluted EPS is up $0.05 or 3.2%. On a sequential basis, there is significant improvement even if we look at the fourth quarter before nonrecurring charges. On a non-GAAP basis, without charges, the operating margins in the first quarter were 10.1% compared to 11.4% this quarter. Let me give you a little bit of detail on the results of our operating segments and, hopefully, provide you some color. First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue was up $155 million, almost 10% against the year-ago quarter, and profit is up $39 million, 14.4% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. I am pleased to report that jet aviation made a contribution in the quarter. In short, nice operating leverage. From a market perspective, we're seeing adequate interest in both new and existing product lines. The backlog and orders in the quarter make me comfortable with the revenue projections I gave for Aerospace for the year. We have some opportunity to outperform our guidance. So far, so good. At Combat Systems, revenue declined $358 million against the year-ago quarter, but operating earnings were up $12 million, almost 6% on 13.8% margin. However, it is well remembered that there was an accounting charge in the year-ago quarter for this segment. On a non-GAAP basis, ignoring charges, margins are flat. Sequentially, even after the fourth quarter non-GAAP adjustments, margins improved by 130 basis points. From my perspective, a very good operating performance despite reduced revenue and continued struggles in Europe. With respect to backlog, the significant international order activity we expected in the first quarter had flipped to the right. We are still actively negotiating these transactions and have confidence they will close. We expect Combat Systems revenue to improve steadily during the year quarter-over-quarter, but still fall short of the revenues guidance I gave you at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, operating margins will be better than my earlier guidance. Margins for the year should be in the range between 13.5% and 13.8%, but could be somewhat lumpy on a quarterly basis, depending on the timing of further restructuring charges in Europe. Marine group. The Marine group continues to perform effectively. Compared to the first quarter of last year, revenue was up $21 million, 1.3%, and earnings and margins are down, as expected, as a result of the conclusion of the highly profitable T-AKE Program last year. In all other respects, program earnings held steady or are up slightly. Operating margins are at a respectable 9.8%. This group is expected to be highly consistent during the remainder of the year with respect to both revenue and operating margin. At IS&T, revenue is up modestly, $7 million, but earnings are down against the first quarter last year on lower operating margins. This was as planned. The operating earnings at 7.6% represent a significant improvement over the fourth quarter last year on a non-GAAP basis, ignoring the charges. We are working diligently to pursue -- for improved margins and expects stronger margins in the second half of the year. Our order activity remains good with a book to bill of 1:1. Let me conclude my remarks by saying we had a strong quarter. We beat consensus and, frankly, beat our plan. We're off to a good start, and our internal focus on operations is gaining traction. I'll turn over the mic for a few minutes to Hugh Redd, and he can provide a bit more detail.
L. Hugh Redd: Well, thank you, Phebe, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to cover a few miscellaneous items before the question-and-answer period. First, net interest expense was $23 million for the quarter versus $39 million in 2012. For 2013, we expect net interest expense of approximately $90 million, reflecting the full impact of the debt refinancing completed late in 2012. At the end of the quarter, we had only $165 million of net debt, down about $450 million from year end. The effective tax rate was 30.7% for the quarter, which reflects the impact of the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2012, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. For 2013, we still expect an effective tax rate approaching 32%. Finally, with respect to pensions, we continue to expect cash contributions to the plans to approximate $600 million for 2013. The bulk of the funding is expected to occur in the second half of the year. That concludes my remarks. And, Erin, I'll turn the time back over to you for Q&A.
Erin Linnihan: Thanks, Hugh. [Operator Instructions] Sue, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: On the Aerospace side, I was wondering, Phebe, if you could give us an update on the market demand as you're seeing it and really honing in on the 550 and 450 where backlog is today, and just color as you see demand going the rest of the year. I mean, how are you thinking about production in that context?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Joe, as you all know, our book to bill has been below 1:1. But I think this is important to understand, with respect to Gulfstream, that data can be misleading. It's the mix of orders that are important, and a significant, in fact, a preponderance of the order in this -- orders in this quarter were for the G550 and G450 where we need them. So we carefully watched that portion of the order book to determine production rates. We're solid for the year and have not made a judgment about next year's rate on these aircraft. To the extent the rate is down for next year on the 450, 550 and we have no reason to believe at the moment that it would be, but to the extent that it is, it will be overcome by increases in the 650 and 280. So in general, we are very comfortable with where we see our backlog and our new order activity.
Operator: And your next question comes from Carter Copeland, Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just -- I'm going to resist the urge to ask about the Aerospace margins and instead ask a bigger picture question, Phebe. You've now had another quarter under your belt here to do business reviews, think about what you want to do with the company from a strategic perspective. And I wondered if you might share with us your perspectives on risks and opportunities you've identified over the last quarter or how things are shifting in your mind, and just your general sort of high-level thoughts on what direction you want to take the company in.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Let me answer that by giving you sort of an overview of how I see our portfolio and businesses developing through the long-range planning process. Gulfstream will grow significantly in that timeframe, and their margins will have improved. Marine group will grow on increased revenue in submarine market throughout that period. IS&T has obviously significant margin opportunity. And for Combat, we have sufficient international interest to bridge to a more robust army spending when the army needs to recapitalize. So in general, I like where we -- I like the offsetting cyclicality that we have embedded into our businesses. And in all respects, we see a very clear way forward. Does that answer you?
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes, it does.
Operator: And your next question is from Jason Gursky, Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a couple of quick questions. One on the sequester and just generally talk about your thoughts on sequester. And then secondly, on cash deployments and update us there on your thought.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think that there is a enormous amount of specificity in the press about sequester and the machinations that are going on in Washington. So there isn't much specifics that I can add other than give you some clarity about our business. Getting the full year FY '13 funding bill was a major upside event for our planning. That said, the final sequester impacts by program have not been communicated to us by our customer. If I think about where, at least for 2013, we're likely to see some impact, it would be in Combat Systems' shorter-cycle programs. And that's why I think that revenue may be a touch softer than I had anticipated. But in general, we do not see sequester as a significant threat to '13. Most of our sales are in our backlog. Cash deployment. Thanks, Erin. I think about cash deployment in 3 basic buckets. Dividends -- and this is for this year, dividends, share repurchases and strengthening our balance sheet. In March, the board announced a 10% dividend increase, the 13th consecutive year of dividend increases that yielded a 3% yield. I think that was very wholesome. And with respect to dividends, what you need to expect from us is consistency, predictability and sustainability. I think that that's important. Share repurchases, you're going to see us, throughout the remainder of the year, act accordingly in shareholder-friendly ways with respect to share repurchases. And then given the charges in the fourth quarter, we need to strengthen our balance sheet a touch. I don't see any acquisitions on the time -- on my current time horizon, but that doesn't mean that there's something small and in our core that we wouldn't be interested in looking at it. But at the moment, I've got nothing, and that's fine. We continue to want to focus internally.
Operator: And your next question is from Yair Reiner, Oppenheimer.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Well, I can't resist asking about the Aero margins. Can you talk about the puts and takes in the quarter? Obviously, a very strong performance there. And then how we should think about the trends sequentially for the balance of the year?
Phebe N. Novakovic: There were 2 primary drivers of our performance: one, Jet had a good quarter and made a good contribution in excess of their plan; and second, we made progress on the 650 manufacturing margins and dealing with the retrofit issues that we talked about during the last call. As we begin to smooth the transition between green deliveries and outfitting, we'll continue to see better margin improvement. So as I think through the year, it's premature to increase our guidance. We need to work through the remainder of our retrofit issues, which ought to clarify by the end of the second quarter. And with respect to Jet, they have remedied and fixed their underlying operational problems. The key there to a long-term value proposition is volume on completion. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about the quarter-over-quarter and for the year. We've got some upside, but we're not ready to declare it yet until we get through some of the retrofit issues, okay?
Operator: And your next question is from Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein. We'll take the next question from Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Actually, I thought I'd rather follow up on Joe's earlier question on Aerospace and the demand environment. I was wondering if you could comment on the pricing, particularly for the 450 and 550 and also, what your sort of lead time is for an order today, because I think in the past, you said you'd feel comfortable with an 18-month lead time on those jets.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Our pricing is holding up nicely on both the 450 and the 550, and we have sufficient visibility into the year to be very comfortable with our production rates. And as we move into next year, we've got to assess where we are in terms of the 450, 550. But today, we're very comfortable. So we're slightly underneath that, the window of 18 to 24 months, but not materially and not to any extent that would make us concerned. As I mentioned earlier, it's really the mix, and we analyze that portion of the backlog in order to determine our production rate. So, so far, it's steady as she goes.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Has there been any improvement on the G280 pricing?
Phebe N. Novakovic: We have some improvement as we begin to move that in -- that airplane into the market more robustly. We've got a fair amount of demand there, and we like where we are. G280 is generating an awful lot of interest as we expected it would.
Operator: And your next question is from Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Phebe, if we could go back to Jet for a moment, I'm wondering with all the restructuring there, if you can frame for us what the business looks like today, the mix of business between corporate jet MRO and completions and relative size versus what it looked like when you first acquired it and how that should then trend going forward so we have a better understanding of that -- how that's supposed to look.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Sure. So Jet is a smaller business than when we acquired it, primarily because we failed to integrate Jet in a timely fashion. We have now solved all of the underlying performance issues, particularly -- and not on the MRO side, but particularly on the completion side. So the mix of business going forward, there is -- this is how I think about it. There's always a fair amount of volatility, particularly in Europe, with respect to maintenance, and you saw that we restructured that maintenance business to reflect the demand. And so far, the demand for service is holding up fairly well, given our expectations. So going forward, the issue for us is completion both of the corporate jets and then the large-body and narrow-body major completion projects that we're perfectly capable of executing. And now that we've got the Gulfstream discipline embedded and inculcated throughout Jet, we're likely to perform very well on. So I'm optimistic about where Jet sits. [Indiscernible]. Go ahead.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was just going to say, is there a way to think about the mix of completions versus MRO? Since you bought the business, clearly, some of the other corporate jet manufacturers have gone elsewhere, but you still have your captive business, you still have the heavy Jet business. And so...
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, we do. And I think you'll see completions becoming a larger part of the backlog going forward, and that has addition -- I like that because we've got additional margin and cash-generation opportunities. So as a mix, we're likely to move more into completions and with the steady undercurrent and undergirding of service, which I -- the service industry or the service business, which I think we have rightsized appropriately.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: When do you think you'll hit your target margins there?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think we've got to bring in the -- some additional revenue. And when we do that, we'll -- probably in the next year or 2, we ought to be able to see some real upside.
Operator: And your next question is from Noah Poponak, Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Phebe, I wanted to try to dive into Combat a little further. Perhaps you can walk us through the major moving pieces that drove the larger-than-expected revenue decline in the quarter. And then when you sit back and look at the longer-term view on the segment, it's come down somewhat significantly off the peak, but is still a much, much larger business than it was a long time ago. When you consider all the different inputs to the scenario analysis, maybe you could share with us sort of a range of potential outcomes for where you think this business bottoms, given what could happen with sequestration and what you're expecting internationally, et cetera.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So revenues for the quarter-over-quarter or the year, quarter -- first quarter '12 versus first quarter '13 were lower. But I have to tell you, that was well within our expectation. And with respect to both earnings and revenue, Combat Systems outperformed their plan. So our plan was built on a presumption of softer orders and sort of softer sales in the first quarter and then building through the year. I've -- I have factored in now the impact of sequestration into Combat estimates, and so we may see a touch lighter overall sales for the year, but not much. So I think we have stabilized with respect to our current order book. And the key for us is executing and delivering into our backlog some of the large international orders that we're continuing to work. Once we get those in, then it will be a little bit easier to give you some additional view and others some additional clarity around the long-term prospects. But Combat, we're not going to chase revenues, and I think I mentioned that to you all on the last call. And we will rightsize our business to the revenues that we have currently, hence, our good margin performance. What we'll promise you all is margin expansion and cash generation, and you got to meet market where the market is. That said, we haven't -- we have very, very nice and robust international orders that ought to bridge until the army begins to recapitalize.
Operator: And your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just quickly, I guess, on the Combat is -- I just wanted to ask a question. You haven't explicitly said it, but I assume you're still comfortable with your current earnings outlook that you provided back in January. And when you say a touch lighter for Combat, what -- how does that vary to the minus 6% you talked about back in January? And then I just wanted a little clarification on the international order, because I thought it was really one order. But the way you referred to is multiple transactions. So can you help us think through some of what you're pursuing there?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Sure. We're looking at about -- perhaps around an 8% versus 6% decline for the year, and I'm very comfortable with that estimate. I think we derisked with respect to sequestration. If you recall, it was not part of sequestration, and the impact of it was not part of our original guidance. But operating margins are expected to be higher, and so it's going to leave us pretty much on track with respect to our operating earnings. The -- we have a series of transactions, international transactions that we're continuing to work the Ts and Cs on. And while I'm a little reluctant to give any specificity on when we expect to have them closed, we see no reason that they won't close. And hopefully -- and most probably, it'll be in the second quarter.
Operator: And your next question comes from George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: I wanted to pursue Gulfstream a little bit more, a little more detail. I assume there weren't any -- wasn't any forfeiture income this year and if you could compare the jet profit to what it was last year. And then I'm guessing the book to bill was above one, if you just looked at it for 450s and 550s. And then just if you could tell us how many 650 deliveries there were.
Phebe N. Novakovic: We had fewer defaults in this quarter than we did in the first quarter of '12, which then reduced our liquidated damages for this quarter, which is a good thing in my mind. The 450 and 550 continue to be at around 1:1. So we're comfortable in the quarter with where we are with respect to that. And your final question was -- remind me? 650. We're not going to give you breakouts on our large cabin, of what constituted the large-cabin sales by line. I don't think that that's healthy or helpful, because we end up in a giant variance analysis. But I will tell you that the preponderance of orders in the quarter, about 80% of them were in the 450, 550 for large cabin. So I hope that helps you.
George Shapiro: Yes. And then the other part of the question was how did Jet's perform compare to last year's first quarter, the completions business? How much better was it?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Outstanding. We were breaking even last quarter. And this quarter, we made considerable amount of money, so -- for Jet. So I'm very pleased with where they are [indiscernible] just to keep it going.
George Shapiro: You don't want to quantify considerable anymore?
Phebe N. Novakovic: No, sorry.
Operator: And your next question comes from David Strauss, UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Phebe, on sequestration, you obviously talked about 2013 not much of an impact, because most is in backlog. It would look like you still got about 25% that you have to secure through the course of the year that could be subjected to sequestration, if you could comment on that. And then as we think about 2014, any initial thoughts on what we could be looking at in terms of a -- the revenue environment for the defense businesses, given sequestration?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Sure. First, for '13, I have given you my estimate of the impact from sequestration. While we haven't had a lot of specificity from our customer, what we've been able to see is we've got a touch softness in Combat. We -- but if you step back, both with respect to IS&T and almost the entirety of our platform businesses, the sales are in backlog. So '13 is looking solid, and I don't see much of a risk to that at all. With respect to '14, the President's Budget Request was good for us in several respects. All of our shipbuilding programs were well supported. And the support for Stryker, the double-V hull exchange over the next 5 or over the 5-year plan, was especially encouraging. Also, the army's communication network modernization appears to be budgeted at a higher level than it has in the past. So while there is no way to estimate the extent of sequestration or additional budget cuts, since who knows how that's all going to play out, but as we stand now, we like what we saw in the President's Request. And I'll tell you something. When I think back -- putting my old budgeteer hat on, there are 2 kinds of programs that tend to be impacted in a down environment, a revenue-constrained environment. Those are troubled programs and developmental programs. And in -- with respect to both, we are in very good shape. Our programs are all green, very, very good solid performance, and that's frankly the best antidote to the budgeteer's scalpel. And in addition, new starts, we are comfortable where we are in the programs that are moving from development into production. And so I've got to tell you, I think we're pretty well positioned. As I said, performance sells.
Operator: Your next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr, Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes. So to get back to the Aerospace margins, I mean, pretty clearly, you had -- while you didn't give us the numbers, you're going to have had more deliveries in the 3 G650s you did, so you have had an adverse mixed shift. And just kind of backing through an estimate of the numbers, it looks like profitability would have been better year-over-year, the large biz jets. Maybe give us a little more color. Has that -- given you -- presumably you're in the midst of rework there on the G650, I mean, it looks either the 450 and 550 margins improved for the fourth quarter or the G650 was considerably better. Is that correct, and maybe...
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. Let me walk you through some of that. The 450 and 550 are mature programs that we're continuing to reap the benefits of process improvements. So our margins will continue -- they have increased and they'll continue to increase. With respect to the 650, we're moving down the learning curve in the green manufacturing process, which is exactly what we anticipated. And the uncertainty where we don't have great clarity yet is what is the running rate on margins and completions. But with respect to 450, 550, margins were better. And the 650, on the green deliveries, we're coming down that learning curve, very, very nicely. And then we'll stabilize going forward as we work that retrofit imbalance through the completions process.
Operator: And your next question comes from Peter Arment, Sterne Agee.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Yes. I guess my question was very similar to Cai's. I guess another way to characterize it is, I guess, when your rework in balance is completed in the second quarter, should we think that -- and not to get ahead of ourselves on margins, but the mix in the second half of the year should look better than the first? Is that fair?
Phebe N. Novakovic: We will build through the course of the year, yes. But I'm not -- I don't want to get you guys there until we've really worked through this retrofit, because there's still risk out there. We're confident that we'd work through the majority of it. No surprises. But until we rebalance green with completions, we're just not ready to give you a higher -- or change our guidance. We'll take a look at doing that at end of the second quarter.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I appreciate that. If I could just squeeze in one last one. Just on -- unrelated, but is -- what is left on the share buyback authorization?
L. Hugh Redd: 9 point...
Phebe N. Novakovic: 9-point-something million shares.
Operator: Your next question is from Bill Loomis, Stifel.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Phebe, so just to be clear, the $6.60 to $6.70 guidance you gave, which did not have sequestration in January, that that's post-sequestration and the impact, which you said is mostly some of portion of Combat, that now that would include sequestration?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. Because as I pointed out, the softness was in -- is in revenue, but our margins will expand in Combat. And so our earnings will be -- operating earnings are going to be right on mark.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then on the IS&T side, on some of the shorter-cycle-like services business, you don't see a sequestration impact or any pullback in business on that short-cycle services side?
Phebe N. Novakovic: No. And in fact, our services business is running better than 1:1 book to bill, and I like how they're positioned. Let me give you a little bit more color with respect to services. With -- for the most part, we find competition's very, very wholesome. But there's a phenomenon that's occurring in the service business that can be fairly troubling to the overall customer satisfaction, and that is competition for price. We were not going to be -- participate in a race to the bottom. In those instances where we don't believe there is sufficient price permitted in a particular bid or contract, we're going to walk away. We've done that on occasion, but continuing to provide our customer with very good services and products. And it's awful hard to do in an abnormally-constrained price environment. So in those instances where we can't live up to our promises, we're going to walk away. And I think that's appropriate and healthy.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then -- fine. Just a quick one on Combat. You said a portion of Combat is going to be impacted by sequestration. Obviously, not the longer cycle stuff. What -- can you just give us a little more detail on which -- what is that portion that might get impacted by sequestration that you're concerned about?
Phebe N. Novakovic: It's going to be in the shorter-cycle products, some that fluctuate with the demand for the war. Those tend to be more at risk if the supply is in excess of the demand. But as I say, it's not material and does not affect our overall performance and operating earnings.
Operator: And your next question is from Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was -- I'm hoping you could give us some color maybe on the sequential pattern of revenue to the course of the rest of the year, just so we're on the same page. I think the top line is something we've been struggling with for a few quarters now. Maybe just to baseline what the profile, in particular, of Combat is through the course of the year to get to that $7.4 billion. And then secondly, Phebe, is it fair to think that you're now comfortable with the portfolio and with what sequestration's impact is so that share repurchase would really get restarted here with more aggressive fashion?
Phebe N. Novakovic: So with respect to Combat, we are, as I mentioned in the first quarter, above our revenue plan and our earnings. And what we had anticipated performing to throughout the course of the year was a building quarter-over-quarter of revenue. You may see some lumpiness in margins as we take the rest of our restructuring charges in Europe, but we'll see a nice solid build quarter-over-quarter. With respect to where we find ourselves in the cash and the balance sheet and the risk in the environment, as I said, we had anticipated a very light order for cash. It came in much stronger but toward the end of the quarter. Once we were comfortable that the cash was being generated, as we were anticipating toward the end of the quarter, then we ventured back into the market but fairly late in the quarter. So going forward, I think you can expect us to participate in share repurchases in a shareholder-friendly manner.
Operator: And the next question is from Ron Epstein, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Maybe a bigger strategic question around Gulfstream. You had lot of questions, so far, on that. When you think about the 450 and 550 line. as you probably know, there's been some noise that there's been some discussion about updating those planes or replacing those planes with something. How do you think about that? I mean, when's the right time to do it? And -- I mean, if you can give us any color on how you think about that challenge.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, as you know, we, several years ago, instituted a fairly disciplined R&D program to refresh and replace our platforms, our airplanes as we move forward. We'll continue -- we are continuing that. And we will make announcements about any potential new planes when we're ready, when we know that with great certainty that we can give you clarity around what it is and, more importantly, when it'll be available. And that's -- and we're not there yet and I'm not going to speculate. I don't think that does anybody any good.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes. No, sure. And then maybe just one last question. On the midsize right, this quarter you delivered 5 compared to 2 last year. Can you give any description around what Gulfstream is seeing in the midsize market? Is there any pickup? Is it just happen to be timing and a little bumpy and that's why we got more? What's going on there?
Phebe N. Novakovic: No. I'll tell you, the 280 is generating an awful lot of customer interest. It is a great airplane that fills that niche. And frankly, we're -- got very, very robust sales pipeline, and we like what we see. So I anticipate 280 is to grow throughout the year.
Operator: And your next question is from Howard Rubel, Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: You resized the corporate staff, cut it by about 10%, and we've seen 1 or 2 other business units that have followed suit. Do you expect most of the other business units to take this mandate and run with it as well? I mean, could you kind of elaborate a little bit on what you're doing on the cost side to make the business more affordable?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Both at the corporate headquarters and throughout our businesses, each one of our businesses, we have an obligation to -- through a continuous improvement and some restructuring internally to drive costs out, and we've done that at the corporate headquarters and fairly significantly. Many of our business units are already in the process of undertaking efficiencies in their back-office functions, as well as in their production line. But overhead -- going after overhead is critical to margin expansion in a down environment. So you can believe -- you can better believe that we're going to be very, very focused on taking costs out. And we've done it, and we'll continue to do it.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just a follow-up on that. Does that lead to more business opportunities? And maybe you could highlight 1 or 2. Or does it end up just showing up on the bottom line?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think it's both. It clearly helps margins. But the extent to which you can bring down your prices, you're increasingly competitive. And we have done that across every one of our portfolios, across all of our portfolios in almost all of our lines of business. So I see cost cutting and continuous improvement efficiencies as central to our ability to win more business and increase our margins and, frankly, provide a superior product to our customer.
Operator: Your next question comes from Neal Dihora, Morningstar.
Neal Dihora - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I guess my question is more of long term. But I think GD is one of the few companies that sort of has headcount reductions over the last 5 years. And I guess -- just wondering if the next 3 to 5 years is going to be materially different from that perspective.
Phebe N. Novakovic: We reduce headcount in response to the business environment that we're faced with. So I certainly won't preannounce any restructuring, but you can rest assured that we will tackle our -- all aspects of costs as we go forward.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3583. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Carissa, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Erin Linnihan, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Erin Linnihan: Thank you, Carissa, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning to all, and thank you, Erin. For those of you who do not know, Erin is our new Director for Investor Relations. She's replaced Amy Gilliland who's been assigned to a broader portfolio, reporting directly to me. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the fourth quarter, which is dominated by the charges. You're going to hear more about that from Hugh Redd. I do intend to spend time -- some time giving you a sense of my thinking about 2012, and then spend a bit more time on 2013. I'll try to keep my remarks somewhat brief to provide sufficient time to address your questions. With respect to the fourth quarter, I would focus you on the revenue drop versus the same quarter a year ago. The single largest cause of which is the revenue decline at European Land Systems. This is a salient fourth quarter impact that carries over into 2013, which we'll talk about in a bit more detail. For the full year 2012, let's first talk about Aerospace. The group had notable growth. Sales and earnings increased by double-digits. At Gulfstream, both revenue and earnings were strong, with revenue up over $800 million and earnings up $110 million. There was some decrease in margin as a result of a mix shift toward early production G650 and 280s. Of course, we had higher default penalties in the prior year that somewhat inflated the 2011 margin. Gulfstream also brought to market 2 clean sheet aircraft that entered into service pretty much on the schedule we first announced back to you in 2008. Jet Aviation performed better than 2011, with revenues up almost 10% and earnings better than last year without regard to charges. The management team at Jet has addressed the underlying operational performance issues in completion, and their processes are dependable going forward. In all, Aerospace had a good year and delivered on its promises. Combat Systems. Sales as reported were lower by over $800 million and earnings before nonrecurring charges were down $215 million compared to the prior year. 75% of the sales decrease and 75% of the earnings decline were attributable to European Land Systems. In the North American-based businesses, sales were down somewhat at our shorter-cycle businesses, but Land Systems sales, earnings and margins were higher. And each of our U.S. businesses maintained double-digit margin. So what can we deduce from this? First, in recognition of European fiscal realities, we are restructuring our European business and taking cost out to position us for the future. Second, our North American-based businesses performed extremely well given the current budget environment, particularly at the biggest business, Land Systems. Let's move on to the Marine group. Sales were down less than 1% on timing of submarine and surface ship programs. Earnings were up 8.5% on good performance across all 3 of our shipyards. I particularly like the story at Electric Boat, the largest business. Revenue was down very modestly, and we had a 50 basis point margin improvement. NASSCO had outstanding performance and superb profit contribution on the T-AKE Program. IS&T. As we reported, the group lost $1.2 billion of sales year-over-year and approximately $400 million of earnings before nonrecurring charges. C4 Systems sales decline was about 75% of the group's total decline. The earnings decline at C4 was about 2/3 of the group's earnings decline, driven by lower revenue in general and a volume reduction in some of their higher-margin products in particular. Our GD U.K. business accounted for approximately 20% of the sales decline as reported and 20% of the earnings decline before charges, in part from reduced volume and in part from some performance issues. Clearly, we are not pleased with the considerable decline in margins in this group, about 270 basis points without regard to charges. In addition, the impact of dramatic sales and earnings decline in C4 and GD U.K. created a mix shift in the group toward lower margin IT services. Conversely, long second half orders, including orders at C4 for WIN-T HMS Rifleman and Manpack radios helped stabilized C4 moving forward. Think about it this way, C4 had a book-to-bill for 2012 greater than 1. The margin decline in this group is explicable, but the performance was disappointing at best and will be addressed. In summary, for the entire entity, cash performance was strong. I liked Aerospace's excellent growth in both revenue and earnings. Combat Systems North American businesses performed well in the middle of a tough budget environment. The European combat vehicle business was a negative, but as you can see from the charges, we are addressing their cost structure this year. Marine remained steady with good operating performance. IS&T did not perform as anticipated, and we're going to work that hard in 2013. Our large powerful core platform businesses, Electric Boat, Gulfstream and Land Systems continue to perform at very high levels, generating EBIT, EBIT margins and cash. So let's turn to 2013. With respect to revenue, our plan rolls up to somewhat less than a 1% sales increase over 2012, led by 16% growth at Aerospace, offset in part by a 3% to 4% decline in our Defense business. Combat and IS&T are each contributing about 50% of the decline, with Marine growth offsetting the decline somewhat. A reasonable range for sales this year is flat to up 1.5%. Operating earnings should be essentially flat when compared to 2012 results before nonrecurring items. The plan contemplates an overall operating margin in the mid-11% range, reflecting a slight compression compared to 2012 before nonrecurring items. Aerospace and IS&T margins are planned to be better than 2012 margins before nonrecurring charges, offset by a decline in the Marine group margins and a slight drop at Combat Systems. Here is how we plan to perform across our groups in greater detail. First, Aerospace. Our plan reflects a 16% sales growth led by Aerospace. Operating earnings are planned to increased 19% when compared with 2012 results before nonrecurring items. This represents increased margins of 40 basis points compared to 2012. Aerospace has additional revenue and earnings potential beyond the plan. Jet has stabilized its operations. Additional revenue opportunities in completions, if realized, would provide some improvement in profitability, though we remain properly cautious about this market. At Gulfstream, margin improvement over plan is dependent on 650 performance. There is upside if we can beat planned cost performance on G650 manufacturing and completion. Combat. Revenue is planned to be down approximately 6% when compared with 2012 group revenues as reported. The decline is attributable to a reduction in Combat theater-related services and in our shorter cycle U.S. businesses. The group's operating margin is anticipated to be in the mid-13%. Marine group. Sales in the group are highly predictable and are planned up almost 2% from 2012. Earnings, however, are down on margin compression as a result of mix shift at NASSCO, caused entirely by the end of the highly successful T-AKE Program in 2012. The plan anticipates a Marine group operating margin of approximately 9.4%. This is still industry-leading performance by no small measure. That said, we will seek to improve these anticipated margins as we go forward through the year. IS&T. Revenue is planned to be down against 2012 by almost 5%. Margins, however, are up 20 basis points against last year's performance before nonrecurring items. The margin increase is a result of improved performance, primarily at C4 Systems and at AIS as their plans have stabilized, and they drive cost out of their business. In summary, as COO, I worked with our business units to develop realistic operating plans based on a comprehensive analysis program by program and our best assessment of risk and opportunity. We only recently finalized our operating plan to capture the current outlook as best we could. The plan contemplates a full year's continuing resolution and is reasonable, subject to some risk on the sales side in the event of sequestration and more draconian budget cuts than currently contemplated. Due to its short cycle businesses and O&M exposure, the IS&T outlook will remain most sensitive to any additional budget cuts that may occur. Our margins have been good apart from recent IS&T performance, but there's plenty of room for improvement. We will be working cost-cutting initiatives across all of our lines of business. I'll have more to say about that later in the year. The opportunities for upside, and they are significant, are on margin improvement, cash generation and driving performance side of the equation. We will focus this year on operations to drive cost out of our businesses and improve performance. But I do not intend to guide you to higher operating margins than are currently embedded in our plan because we have yet to earn them. I'll now turn over the mic to Hugh Redd to provide you detail on the charges and other items.
L. Hugh Redd: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I intend to discuss in detail the charges in the quarter, including goodwill impairment and a few other miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period. But before I discuss the goodwill impairment, I would like to address other discrete charges, which impact the fourth quarter by segment. First impacting the Aerospace group. We recorded a $191 million impairment of intangible assets associated with Jet Aviation's maintenance business. Jet's business, particularly in Europe, has been impacted negatively by recent economic conditions and an increasingly competitive marketplace, where we are seeing OEMs perform maintenance work that was previously performed by third-parties like Jet. As a result of these market trends, in the fourth quarter, we reviewed the long-lived assets associated with Jet's maintenance business and eliminated the remaining value of the intangible assets. We have repositioned Jet's maintenance business to match anticipated future demand and as a result, expect it to remain profitable in the future. Next, impacting the Combat group. We recorded a charge of $405 million related to our European Land Systems business. Included in this amount is $292 million for accruals for contract disputes, primarily related to our contract with the government of Portugal for 260 Pandur vehicles. During the quarter, we were notified by the Portuguese Minister of National Defense that the contract was terminated for an alleged breach of contract. Subsequent to that notification, the customer has drawn $73 million on bank guarantees related to the contract. While we have asserted that we are not in breach of the contract and that the termination of the contract was invalid, we reserved the receivables and inventory on our books and accrued an estimate to satisfy the remaining obligations to close out the contract. We filed a demand for arbitration to protect our rights, but the outcome is difficult to predict given the customers' behavior to date. The other significant items in the charge for our European Land Systems business are $98 million of restructuring-related costs and $50 million of inventory write-downs. Late in the fourth quarter, we committed to a restructuring plan to eliminate excess capacity and align the size of our European business with future demand. This amount consists primarily of severance costs, which are expected to be paid in 2013. The next 2 discrete charges in the quarter impacted the Information Systems and Technology group. In the quarter, we recorded a $110 million impairment of intangible assets associated with a prior acquisition in the optical products area of the business. As a result of competitive losses and award delays in the fourth quarter, we reviewed the livelong -- the long-lived assets of this business for impairment and eliminated much of their remaining value. Also in the quarter, we recorded $38 million to write-off obsolete inventory, primarily ruggedized computers and associated parts inventory as projected sales are not likely to materialize. The goodwill impairment also impacted the IS&T segment. During the fourth quarter, we conducted the required goodwill impairment test just as we do every year. For 3 of our segments, step 1 of the test resulted in estimated fair values far in excess of book values as of 12/31/2012. For IS&T however, the book value exceeded the estimated value. Accordingly, we performed a very detailed step 2 of the test for the IS&T segment, which resulted in a $2 billion impairment loss, which has been recorded in the fourth quarter results. Some further background on this noncash charge. Since its formation in 1997, our IS&T segment has completed 38 acquisitions. The goodwill associated with these 38 acquisitions totaled $8.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2012 and represented 58% of the total company goodwill. As we've been discussing for several quarters and as Phebe outlined, IS&T has experienced continued top line pressure, resulting from slow defense spending in their markets and margin compression due to mix shift and cost performance. In fact, from its high point in 2010, revenues in IS&T are down almost 14% and margins have declined 270 basis points. Accordingly, our projection of future cash flow from IS&T has been impacted, leading to a lower estimated fair value than we have calculated in prior years. The impairment charges reduced the carrying value of IS&T goodwill by 25%. Leaving the segment charges behind, net interest expense was $41 million for the quarter versus $38 million in 2011. For 2012, our interest expense for the full year was $156 million, right in line with our prior estimates. For 2013, we expect net interest expense to decline to approximately $90 million, reflecting the full year impact of our $2.4 billion debt refinancing, which we completed in December 2012. As you know, that refinancing lowered our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 2.2% and extended our average maturities by 7 years. There was a charge of $123 million included in other expense in the quarter related to the bond redemption premium for the refinancing. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects approximately $600 million of net debt, a reduction of $400 million from the prior year. The reported effective tax rates are somewhat meaningless for comparative purposes, and with that in mind, I'll address them. The effective tax rate was negative 2.8% for the quarter and a positive 161.4% for the full year. The fourth quarter rate and the full year rate were impacted significantly by the fact that the discrete charges had either reduced or no tax benefit. For 2013, we expect an effective tax rate around 32%, taking into consideration the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit, the impact for 2012 and 2013 being recognized in the 2013 rate. The operating cost attributable to corporate were $69 million for the full year 2012 versus $77 million for 2011. The amount for 2013 will be closer to $90 million. During 2012, we contributed approximately $530 million in cash to our pension plans. For 2013, our funding expectation is approximately $600 million, with 60% of that funding occurring during the third quarter. Finally, we ended the year with $3.3 billion in cash, and as I said, net debt of $600 million. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and strong credit ratings. Our commitment will be evidenced by a disciplined capital deployment strategy throughout 2013. That concludes my remarks. And I'll turn it back over to Erin for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan: Thanks, Hugh. [Operator Instructions] Carissa, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: The question I have is on IS&T margins, and you talked about up 20 basis points on a clean compare in 2012. I just want to make sure that's 8.2%, is that roughly the range?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And could you talk about what the step down has been structurally? Where is the long-term margin opportunity? And maybe for Hugh, was there an -- is there an amortization benefit that's coming in '13 to IS&T that's in that 8.2%?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Let me give you a little bit and then we'll let Hugh answer. Let me give you a little bit of color on 2012 margins and then 2013 margins, all right? We had, as I mentioned, about a 20 -- 270 basis point compression in 2012 margins. And the way I think about the margins is, is here's what's going on. We talked about C4 in '12, and we are confident that their reset plan reflects their market reality and shows considerable improvement year-over-year. The IS&T services have become an increasingly large segment in IS&T, the IT services, and GDIT is a lower margin business than the other IT businesses. Going forward, there are 2 main drivers for 2013, C4 sales and earnings and margins are up in '13 as against '12 before nonrecurring charges, and their margin expansion is around 80 basis points. We've also addressed the operational problems at GD U.K., and we have some stabilization there as well. Offsetting that margin improvement is IT services has about a $350 million lower revenue target and margin compression of about 50 basis points. So net-net, that's how we're rolling up to about an 8.2% margin. Hugh, you want to address the amortization?
L. Hugh Redd: Yes, Myles, there will be less amortization in 2013. I think the number is probably $25 million, maybe slightly more. That has been reflected in the projections that Phebe has and the guidance she's given you.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. I'll stick to one, but Phebe, is there a longer-term margin expansion story for IS&T or is this kind of what we should think about as the business?
Phebe N. Novakovic: There's a longer-term, and let me take this opportunity to explain that. One of the things that ought to be clear is that we have reset the IS&T plan across each one of the businesses, and we have done a very, very realistic program by program analysis that drove our revenue estimate by about 5% lower. And to fire test those assumptions, as part of our planning process, we used a parametric analysis based on several benchmarks including book-to-bill, established budgets and backlogs. So the result of where we're guiding you to in IS&T seems reasonable to me in both program assumptions and by application of the benchmarks. The history tell us a reasonable parametric test of our assumption. So when I think about IS&T, and let's talk about C4 in particular. This is a superb management team that given a realistic and reset plan and given their order book has margin potential. I'm just not going to lead you there, margin expansion potential. I'm just not going to lead you there yet. And that goes into -- that's relevant for '13 and '14. What we see over our long-range plan for IS&T is margin expansion across-the-board, but it's going to be slow and deliberative.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So Gulfstream, could you give us some color on how many 650s did you deliver in the year? How many completions? And give us some color on the delivery assumptions behind your comments on Aerospace for 2013?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, look, we -- as I highlighted and will be re-highlighted in our press release, we delivered 37 aircraft to customers in the quarter, including 31 large cabins, and we're not going to breakout aircraft delivery by model type, and I certainly don't intend to going forward. I can tell you that based on what we reported before, we had 6 G650s that are into service in the fourth quarter. Let me give you a little bit of background on margins. Let's take '12, okay? Starting in the third and fourth quarter, margins were impacted by higher cost of goods sold in connection with the completions and retrofit work for the G650. As a result, we have a temporary disequilibrium between green production and completions as we accommodate some retrofit work out of cycle. We've got to work our way through that over the year. And so that leads me into 2013, and I talked to you about margins in 2013, there are 2 things driving. One is the mix shift, with the larger proportion of 650 and 280s with lower margins at the moment compared with 450s and 550s. It's also about 650 production, which I alluded to, and we have factored the green and completion production rates to account for the balance -- this imbalance in production flow from green completions that will take the duration of the year to resolve. Let me give you, I think it might be helpful for you to understand where we are, and I will give you some color, I think some real detail on how we're seeing our rates and our margins. So let's talk about 650 manufacturing. Overall, the manufacturing of these aircraft is going well. However, not surprisingly, due to the prolonged FAA certification process and our decision to continue manufacturing G650s during that process, there is currently this disequilibrium between initial and final phase manufacturing. And that disequilibrium is the result of retrofit work, mandated by changes to the configuration of initial G650 green aircraft after they were manufactured to conform with FAA approved configuration. So as I say, we've got through the margin guidance we've got in 2013. Anticipate taking the majority of the year to rebalance our initial phase and final phase production. We have some opportunity there, but I'm not willing to call it yet.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I want to talk about cash. Cash relative to adjusted earnings for the full year came in below 100%. Can you talk about, a couple of things, cash conversion in 2013 and then how you plan on -- your plan in terms of deploying the cash, obviously, relative to some of your peers, your dividend yield is a little bit lower, share repurchase, you haven't been as aggressive, focusing more on acquisitions. So just wanted to hear what you were thinking in terms of deploying that cash? And it looks like your guidance for the year doesn't assume anything for share repurchase, if I'm correct?
Phebe N. Novakovic: That's correct. So let me give you a little bit on cash. And you've seen this in '12, and you're going to see it again in '13. Our cash generation in the underlying business continues to be superb. We have considerable CapEx in '12 and again in '13. In '13, we're planned at about $618 million. This is primarily at Gulfstream, and I can tell you we're going to work that number very, very hard. We also have some headwinds in cash with respect to pension, and as I mentioned, a higher CapEx. But let me talk to you a minute about some subject that's near and dear to my heart, and that's capital deployment. I think it should be clear from what I've told you is that I'm going to remain, and as is our management team, focused on operations in 2013. I can tell you, there is almost no acquisition candidates in the current pipeline. I also believe that the acquisition process at GD is somewhat broken, and I will not venture back into that market until we have reestablished the discipline in this process. And I can give you a little bit more color on this. If you consider the acquisitions that were made in Combat, Force Protection in particular, and the repair businesses in Marine, they were excellent. IS&T acquisitions haven't been so far. Regarding dividend and share repurchases, I'm just not going to get ahead of my board, guys, all right?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I have just a broader question. I mean, it seems that after a lot of these changes, you've conducted a very broad business review here. And I wondered if you might discuss the scale and the scope of those actions? And anything it may have revealed broadly about the business, its structure, its competitiveness outside of the weakness that you've obviously called out in AIS and C4 Systems and ELS. Anything you sort of learned that you intend to apply to how you want to run the company in 2013 and beyond?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, that's a very good question. It ought to be clear from the charges that in some respect we took our eye off the ball. Some of our business units performed superbly, but that benefit hasn't accrued to the benefit or that value hasn't accrued to the benefit of our shareholder, and you can better believe that we are going to be focused like a laser beam on that. I can tell you that I have -- I'm very close to our business unit presidents. I know their business. They know their business, and we are completely aligned with the prime directive. And that prime directive is drive cost out of our business, generate earnings and cash, expand our margins and reassure our shareholders that we're wise stewards of their capital. We are going to be focused on operations, and you're going to see that across every single one of our businesses. And let me tell you something else, too, as I think about our business. One of our key jobs is to manage and mitigate risk. And classical risk area argues for diversification, and one of the things that I think we need to understand about GD is we have diversification in 2 respects. First and clearly, we have diversification and countercyclicality with Aerospace and Defense businesses, right, it's pretty active manner. Second however, within our Defense businesses, we are somewhat countercyclical. With the Navy and the Army, our exposure to the Army and the offsetting exposure to the Navy portfolio. So while I see some contraction in our Army market, the Navy tends to be as a result of tactical changes in the budget. The Navy tends to be more strategically driven and vary depending on whether we are in a hot war, that balance between the Navy and the Army. So when you look at that, even within the defense portfolio, I like our balance.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's great. And just as a follow-up to that, Phebe, as you think about the portfolio, you made the comments around M&A and the deal process being broken in some fashions. As you look back over some of the deals that were done, is there the scope for portfolio transformation and divestiture at some point or is it too early to say at this point?
Phebe N. Novakovic: I'm not looking at reshaping our portfolio at the moment. I don't see any compelling reason to do that. We've reset our businesses. Some of the acquisitions that we've made, I'm not a particular fan of, and had I been consulted wouldn't have done. But that said, the teams that we've got around each of these acquisitions are well poised to do -- to perform well. They're poised to perform well. And I got a lot of confidence in these guys, I got to tell you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I want to follow a little bit on Carter, but turn the twist a little bit, and how are you thinking about -- well, kind of bidding and approaching market opportunities. Because the defense budget, while it's north of $500 billion, in many cases, there's great opportunities to take advantage of things you know well and Electric Boat for underseas, UAVs as an example or we saw the other day, you're looking at teaming with an aerospace company to go after a trainer. And then I have a follow-up to that.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, so, look, let's take that in several parts. What you're going to see us do is pursue -- and I can't say this enough -- pursue margin expansion and generate cash and earnings. We are not going to chase revenue. We're going to stick to our knitting and do what we know how to do. This company has a long history of operating excellence, and it's perform, perform, perform. Now that said, we've got, if you look across the portfolio, we've got some real opportunities for organic growth. And I would point you to the Marine group. When you look at the 2-per year Virginia-class, as well as the Ohio replacement program, we've got, frankly, unprecedented growth in the modern era in Marine. And that to me is again all about performance. I like where we are on Combat Systems. It's interesting that nobody has asked me this question, but I'm going to answer it anyway because I'm itching to. The story in Combat Systems over the last few years has really been about Europe. It's not about the domestic or it's not about our domestic companies. They're pretty stable. And Land Systems, the big gorilla there, is extremely stable on its vehicle orders and on its vehicle backlog, and they know how to do what they do. So I like where Combat is. I like where Marine is. Aerospace, we've got to take advantage of the growth in Aerospace, and IS&T, we've repositioned, we've reset their plans. Their backlog is stable and those guys know how to do what they're going to do. So I think we're very well-positioned to deal with any changes that we see in the defense budget because -- yes, let me tell you something, that all comes down to agility, right? What I want to know is, give us the balls and the strikes and we're going to react. Tell us what the spending is going to be, allocate any cuts across the various portfolios and then it's our job to rightsize our businesses, drive costs out and perform for our customers and our shareholders and our people.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And I mean, I think that goes to sort of being careful about contracting. I mean that's -- performance is part of it, but...
Phebe N. Novakovic: Hey, you got that right. Hey, listen, if you think about GD, one of the things that we do very, very well is all about contracts. If you get bad tees and fees in a contract, you are so far behind the power curve that it takes you a long time to dig your way out of that hole. We are absolutely ruthless in our attention to our contracting. And we have got some terrific estimators and some very, very good contract people. And that is, by the way, that is the foundation that we build this business on.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I see it at M&E [ph], the development programs for the Zumwalt I guess really speak to that.
Phebe N. Novakovic: Don't they ever. That is -- that program is doing better than anyone could have expected. And I'll tell you, this is just my own little view, but when those ships hit their speed, I think they're going to have a profound impact. I'm out of my lane when I talk about that, but you know what, it's just my intuition.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: You talked earlier in your opening a bit about the defense cuts embedded in your guidance. Perhaps, you could give us a little bit more specificity there? And then I'm wondering if you could apply your expectations maybe a little longer term, Phebe, to the segments, particularly to Combat and IS&T, and where you think the trough is in those businesses, at least from a revenue standpoint, whether it's '13, '14, '15, how you think about that?
Phebe N. Novakovic: As I see the defense market at the moment, I think IS&T has gone through its trough. I don't see anything under my current projections that would suggest that we've got considerable revenue decline in that business. That said, as I mentioned earlier, because it's a shorter-cycle business and we've got a fair amount of O&M exposure there, they are more vulnerable and more susceptible to dramatic changes in the defense budget. But as of now, and even if I look at -- you can make some estimates about planned cuts, I think we've seen the trough. But let me move to Combat for a minute because I think understanding our order book will help you a little bit. We have anticipated a number of significant international opportunities that we are very well positioned for, but that's really all I'm going to say about that at the moment. You should see some of those opportunities drop into our backlog in the first quarter. But let's think about Combat's backlog more broadly. It's about 1.2x sales at year end, and as I look at the book-to-bill for the entire group, it's been largely increasing quarter-over-quarter in 2012. And Land Systems' book-to-bill has increased significantly, and in the fourth quarter, approached 1:1. And to give you a touch more color on that, what I'm looking at for 2013 is sales growth in the international realm of about 44%. So when I step back and say, okay, if I look at my order book, I look at my book-to-bill, I look at how I'm positioned, how our company is positioned in Land Systems, as well as some of our shorter-cycle businesses, we ought to be able to do extremely well here, and we're reflecting that in our plan. And by the way, when I say plan, I've got a '13 plan, but I see possibility for margin expansion and earnings and cash generation well into '13, '14 and '15. So we got a nice balance here.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So given the book-to-bill in '12 at Combat and the sales guidance you've got there, at what point in the year will we need to see these international orders before you'd find that solidify?
Phebe N. Novakovic: I think you ought to see them drop into our backlog in the first quarter.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly on the...
Phebe N. Novakovic: By the way, I would not be leading you implicit in the guidance that I have given without a fair amount of confidence in these various orders.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Well, and that brings me to just the final part of the question, which is the guidance range is fairly narrow at $0.10, and just given the last couple of years, why not a slightly wider range?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Look, the way I think about this, here's kind of what we've done. We've cleaned up our business, 2013 is our reset year, and I'm going to be pretty conservative here. But don't get out ahead of me, but I'm going to be pretty conservative here and I think that's prudent. We've got some potential budget cuts coming our way. I've got -- the business unit presidents and I are aligned in taking cost out. But I'm going to stay in a fairly narrow band here, in a range that I feel comfortable in guiding you to at the moment. If I see some upside in the year, I'm going to come back at you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just a quick follow-up on that is that in the past, there's been a target for international Combat being about 40% of the total Combat Systems revenues. Do you still see that as a target?
Phebe N. Novakovic: I think we're going to be slightly in -- look, I don't have a target, I'm just telling you what I'm seeing in our pipeline and in our book-to-bill and our backlog. But I'm not -- I think it's in the -- getting approaching the mid-40s.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess the bigger question is just in thinking about the different things you've said in the acquisition discipline, et cetera, is there any change in any of the incentives, and I guess the focus historically has been earnings, free cash and ROIC with respect to the charges and everything that went into '12, how do you see the real drivers and key things that you and your management team need to focus on for incentive compensation changing?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. Now listen, the issues with respect to what I consider to be a somewhat broken internal process, we will address. And you can bet your bottom dollar we're going to address it. But I want to incent this management team to do what we're telling you we're going to do. And the value proposition for GD, margin expansion, earnings and cash. Focus on the basic, perform, perform, perform. Meet our plans and deliver that value to our shareholders and our customers. Can't be any more simple than that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So when you think about just kind of maybe a big strategy question here, about how -- where the budget's going, how your portfolio is positioned, you yourself having been in O&B [ph] and knowing how downturns go. I mean, how is that flavoring, if you will or coloring how you think about the portfolio, how you think about the business? And when I think about General Dynamics 3 years from now, 4 years from now, and you've been in that seat for a while, I mean, what do I have to look forward to? Can you give me some color on that, think strategy?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Look, I'm going to focus on operations in '13 and we're going to continue to do what we are capable of doing on the operations side. And I think you couple that, that discipline that we've had and we're capable of, with very prudent and shareholder-friendly capital deployment. Hey, listen, one of the things that we need to do is reassure our investors that we are wise stewards of their capital, and we will intend to do that. So I will be very cautious going forward, shareholder-friendly, continue to perform, focus on our customers and our people and lead this -- it's interesting, you both lead and serve the management team and the company, and I got to tell you, we are a very, very tight, cohesive management team. And I've got an awful lot of confidence in them.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Can I ask one follow-on as a part of that? Besides the operations, and that's kind of clear and you talked a lot about that, but strategically what do you see as your biggest challenge ahead of you?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, strategically, what we need to do is manage Defense, the Defense businesses in a slightly -- in a down market or in a declining market. And in my mind, we ought to be able to make money. In fact, we should make money as a good cyclical in a down market. And what does that mean? It means that you stay focused on the things that I talked about and that you perform agilely. You've got to be agile. You've got to be able to react quickly to the balls and strikes that come your way. It's all about agility and it's -- that's what a good cyclical does. It's what we're going to do. So I look at that as a challenge, and the opportunity is to take advantage of the growth where we've got it. And that's clear at Gulfstream and in parts of our other businesses where we're going to have organic growth. Did that answer your question?
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, yes, I think so. I mean, I guess the question is, how about parts of the business where you don't have growth, what do you do with those?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Then you're going to drive for earnings and cash, aren't you? I mean, there is no point chasing revenue or pretending that one is in a growth market when you're not. I think what you want from us is realism, putting the mirror up to our face and saying, here's what we see. And based on what we see, delivering on our promises.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne Agee.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: A question regarding Combat Systems again back, but in particular in the backlog. You saw a 10% drop in the kind of the funded backlog, maybe you could just give us a little color exactly what the moving pieces were there. And back focusing on I guess the international piece. At the end of 3Q, 42% of the mix was tied to the wheeled vehicle area in terms of the portfolio. What gives you kind of the confidence that -- is it the indigenous manufacturing aspect of kind of where these operations are that you're going to continue to sustain that or we're not going to be hit with what I think could be some choppiness as you've kind of indicated?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Look, the vehicle -- let's talk about Land Systems. The vehicle market is year-over-year from '12 to '13, our vehicle line of business. That's both tracked and wheeled is essentially flat. And it's a mix of domestic production and international. And I think we have, in fact, we have reflected declines in our decreases in our domestic Army customer's requirements. And we're balancing those with international orders. It's just that simple, and that business -- so given that balance and given what they've got in their backlog and given what you're likely to see in the first quarter in terms of additional backlog, I like that balance. I think that's a diversified and frankly, risk-adjusted portfolio.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just I guess what I was alluding to was more the timing aspect. So the orders coming through for the first quarter that you kind of basically sounds like you can already see kind of offsets that, the pressure that we kind of already understood on the domestic side?
Phebe N. Novakovic: That's right.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I think you mentioned earlier that the defense outlook you have is based on the full year CR. Now it looks as though the budget for 2013 could be a bit smaller than the CR. How should we think about what happens if that budget does get passed? And then also, it does seem as though the potential of sequestration could hit may be increasing, how are you thinking about that today?
Phebe N. Novakovic: The budget that we see for '13, we have factored into our plan. And we can sustain within the current planning cuts across the portfolio. If they get at the level of sequestration or some of sequestration and I take a look at '13 and '14 and the need to come back and rebalance and reassess our guidance, I will. But I got to tell you, even if we've got pretty significant cuts in '13, we have seen very, very little impact as I walk through each of my businesses on the defense side. So absent some, as I mentioned earlier, draconian cuts, we're going to be all right in '13.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line Jason Gursky of Citigroup.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wanted to just focus on Gulfstream for a minute, and get a sense of the current demand in the marketplace. Both on what you would describe at your lower end, as well as the higher end and maybe just walk us around the world on how demand is shaping up and really specifically maybe give us a sense of where we are from a backlog perspective in number of months, particularly for your large cabin aircraft x G650?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Let me preface my answer with giving you some details about our production rates. We're planning 139 green deliveries, 113 large cabin and 26 mid-cabin. And to my point earlier about the rebaselining of completions and manufacturing, we're going to -- our fly rates reflect about a 50% increase in outfitted deliveries. So look, what does that tell you? If you know us, what you know is that we have historically used our production rates to adjust with respect to our -- reflecting our backlog. And that's exactly what we've done here. Everything that I see in the backlog, as well as in our current pipeline, makes me very comfortable with those production rates. We still have demand for our 450, 550, 650, the 280 is coming on strong. And we are well-positioned this year. As I told you, the issue here is at this moment not about our production rates. And look, if you know us, and you know us over time, and you've watched us over time, if we see a -- if something happens and some exogenous factor happens in the overall economy, we will adjust our production rates and we'll come back at you. But I'm not seeing that at the moment. This is very realistic and doable.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then just specifically on kind of regional demand and how it's shaping up?
Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, so interestingly, the largest demand we saw was in our -- was within the Fortune 500 as they're replenishing their fleet. And then I think if you think about the demographics across our portfolio, Asia was down, not surprisingly. And regarding the details about who makes up what percentage, approximately 30% were from individuals, 30% from private and 40% from public companies. But one of the things, again, I like about that backlog and our order book is that it's balanced. We've got North America, we've got Europe, we've got Middle East, Asia. And they tend to ebb and flow somewhat countercyclically. So the good -- one of the very good things that I see is that the Fortune 500s are back into the market.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2012 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Grant, and I'll be your event operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Grant, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter Conference Call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson: Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' third quarter sales totaled $7.9 billion, up modestly from last year's third quarter on strong Aerospace volume. Operating earnings were $905 million, while earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.70 on a fully diluted basis. Third quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $594 million, nearly 100% of earnings from continuing operations. This result is particularly strong given the $321 million of pension contributions we made in the quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion is a healthy 90% of earnings from continuing operations. And I expect the fourth quarter to be another strong cash quarter. In terms of capital deployment, we remain cautious given the unprecedented uncertainty in the coming months caused by the threat of sequestration. For that reason, we did not repurchase any shares this quarter and may not do so until we see more clearly what happens at the start of 2013. We did take advantage of opportunities to deploy $261 million this summer to enhance our defense portfolio with 4 bolt-on acquisitions. These new businesses, which I will detail later in my remarks, better position each of our 3 defense segments for significant future opportunities. In addition to these accretive acquisitions, our multi-year Gulfstream campus investment project continues. Year-to-date, we've returned approximately 70% of free cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Orders this quarter were the strongest of the year, driven by improved award activity at Aerospace and IS&T. At the end of the quarter, backlog was $51.5 billion; while total estimated contract value, which includes backlog in the value of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts, stood at $77.5 billion. Let me briefly address what we're experiencing in today's aerospace and defense environment. Defense bottom line upfront. There's been very little change to the situation for our U.S. Defense businesses since my last update on the second quarter call, except that as predicted, we are now in a continuing resolution through March of next year and we are closer to the fiscal cliff. The same uncertainty regarding the defense budget adjustments that has challenged our industry for the past year continued to impact our customers' behavior in the third quarter, particularly in our shorter cycle businesses where bids awaiting awards are at record levels and descoping actions are becoming much more common practice. We are likely to see more of this in the fourth quarter. We would hope to receive some clarifying details over the next 2 months as this election cycle ends and the Congress returns to address the many important fiscal issues confronting our country. In light of the significant legislative workload, in the limited lame-duck timeline however, it remains difficult to predict whether sequestration will be resolved before January. With that said, discussion about the negative implications of going over the fiscal cliff at year end has escalated in recent weeks. We hope that a bipartisan solution can be brokered to address these serious issues before they take effect in 2013. With limited detail on how sequestration would be implemented, planning for next year is difficult at best. Our government customer continues to assert that there is no -- there are no ongoing planning efforts to prepare for implementing sequestration, should it be triggered. The indiscriminate across-the-board nature of sequestration cuts are troubling for Defense, as well as other federal agencies. Given the lack of planning to date however, we are also extremely concerned about the profound disruption and paralysis that implementing these cuts will likely have on our customer and thus, our entire industry. We continue to focus on managing for earnings and cash, cutting costs and positioning our businesses to better navigate further defense cuts. In Aerospace, we remain encouraged by Gulfstream's sizable large cabin backlog and healthy order pipeline. Several multi-aircraft orders from North American customers, which we had originally expected in the second quarter, materialized in the third quarter. Relative to other periods, however, the order cycle remains somewhat protracted with a number of factors causing deal closure times to increase. Global economic sentiment, particularly in Europe and Asia, and political uncertainty here and abroad continue to influence the velocity of order activity. We continue to believe that we will realize several multi-aircraft international orders in the coming months, although their exact timing for all the factors I just explained is difficult to predict. Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, beginning with IS&T. IS&T sales were $2.5 billion in the third quarter, off somewhat from our expectations, but relatively flat compared to this year's second quarter. Sales through the first half of 2012 as in 2011 reflected continued pressure in our tactical communications business. In the third quarter, however, tactical communications volume was close to our forecast as encryption demand stabilized, albeit at lower levels. Common Hardware Systems-4 program awards improved and development program contract awards, including JTRS and WIN-T, progressed. Volume at our IT service business on the other hand was somewhat lower than expected due to delayed award activity, scope reductions and award losses spawned by renewed customer interest in lowest-priced technically acceptable solutions that favor price over experience and product quality. The group's third quarter operating earnings and margins were $200 million -- $201 million and 8.1%, respectively. These results were negatively impacted by a $25 million charge taken on ruggedized computing equipment inventory at our tactical communications business. We are reorienting that portfolio to focus on -- less on volatile lower margin commoditized products and more on cutting-edge solutions that better align with our core customers' current and emerging priorities. Without the charge, group margins would have been 100 basis points better at 9.1%. This return on sales reflects an overall portfolio mix shift towards service work, an altered mix and lower level of tactical communications volume and continued competitive pressures in this segment as more bidders pursue fewer contracts. Although delayed award activity impacted group sales through the first 3 quarters, IS&T enjoyed its strongest order quarter in 2 years in the third quarter, causing backlog to increase by approximately $800 million to $10.1 billion. Award activity was particularly notable in our tactical communications and IT service businesses. Several of the awards received are long awaited and exemplify the customers' continuing focus on network modernization. These included a $346 million award to continue fielding the Warfighter Information Network, WIN-T Increment 2 capability, and a $54 million award for an additional 13,000 JTRS HMS Rifleman radios and accessory kits. Subsequent to the quarter, we also received an award for another 3,700 JTRS HMS Manpack radios. Awards in our IT service business included a significant opportunity to provide supply chain management services to a relatively new customer, the Department of State, as well as myriad other contracts to provide critical IT support capabilities to existing customers across the federal government. Additional details about contracts received in the quarter are included in today's earnings press release. IS&T's total estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog, increased $1 billion to over $32 billion at quarter end, an improved opportunity set both year-over-year and sequentially. We further enhanced our IS&T portfolio in the third quarter with 2 acquisitions that bolster our presence in priority areas. Open Kernel Labs, now a part of our tactical communications division, brings to our portfolio solutions that enable the secure separation of corporate data from a user's personal data stored on the same device. This technology has wide range in commercial and government applications, as employers increasingly look to better manage IT costs through bring-your-own-device policies. And Fidelis Security Systems, now a part of our industry-leading cyber business, offers highly-regarded software capable of identifying network intruders and preventing hackers from stealing proprietary information. Fidelis's product complements our unique portfolio of cyber incident response capabilities and better positions us for new opportunities as cyber investments grow. Looking ahead, fourth quarter sales will be the group's largest this year as the tactical communications and IT services businesses begin to realize revenues associated with the delayed award activity added to backlog in the third quarter. For the full year, I expect group sales to be down around 8% to 9%, a reduction from my previous guidance. Volume will depend in large part on how rapidly our recent orders translate to sales. Margins for the year will be around 9%. Next, Combat Systems. Combat Systems' third quarter sales totaled nearly $2 billion, reflecting growing foreign military Light Armored Vehicles sales and ground combat vehicle volume, offset by lower Stryker, Abrams, MRAP and European vehicle work. While the decline in these vehicle programs was expected, the group's volume in the quarter was somewhat lighter than we anticipated due to the delay in several anticipated awards. With many of these awards now in hand or imminent, we expect to realize this incremental volume in the fourth quarter. The group's earnings were $274 million, resulting in a 14% operating margin. This margin continues to reflect excellent performance across combat's portfolio of domestic businesses. Our European Land Systems business continues to confront profitability pressures driven by delays in international awards, which reflect the group's challenged indigenous markets and absorption impacts from lower-than-anticipated volume. ELS is aggressively going after cost and has already reduced 20% of its workforce, consolidated or closed numerous facilities around Europe, and implemented a variety of continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives. Total backlog for Combat Systems was $9.4 billion at the end of the quarter. Notable orders in the quarter included $50 million to provide additional Foxhound vehicles to the United Kingdom, $135 million to supply ammunition to Canada and $400 million for research and development efforts to enhance the Abrams tank. Over the next few quarters, we will continue to track several meaningful international order opportunities, including tank upgrades for Morocco and Middle Eastern customers, EAGLE vehicles for Germany and Light Armored Vehicles for several international customers. Although it does not add to today's manufacturing workload, the sizable 8-year Abrams R&D contract received this quarter clearly demonstrates the army customer's long-term commitment to improving the tank's capabilities. For its current planning documents, the Army envisions incorporating Abrams improvements arising from this R&D contract in the 2017 time frame. Consequently, it's important to preserve a healthy and reliable tank industrial base in the interim. The Congress continued to support this notion in the 2013 budget process with all 4 committees adding tank manufacturing funding to the president's budget request. Looming future budget cuts have inhibited the ability of the Pentagon, and in turn our army customer, to solidify the size and shape of the future force. We remain confident, however, that our incumbency in the force will yield a wide range of opportunities to provide our customer affordable, enhanced war fighting platforms. The Stryker Double-V Hull is an excellent example of GD leveraging our experience to bring cost-efficient solutions to the customer. The life-saving benefit of the double-V was established in Afghanistan over the course of the past 18 months. However, prior to the customer's second quarter conversion order, we had not demonstrated our ability to transform flat bottom Strykers into the double-V hull configuration. I'm pleased to say that the very first double-V hull exchange program vehicle is on exhibit at AUSA in Washington as we speak. Production of our initial conversion vehicles is running on time and budget, and we have decisively established the double-V hull exchange program's value proposition, creating more durable combat vehicles at a far lower cost. The Army is currently analyzing the benefits of this program and working towards solidifying additional double-V hull requirements in conjunction with broader force structure studies. Given the success of the program to date, we anticipate additional conversion orders. Similarly, our Combat Systems group remains involved in a variety of development programs for our Army and Marine Corps customers. Our work on these development programs will help the customer identify and incorporate key technological advancements into today's vehicles and tomorrow's fighting force. GD's focus on bringing affordable solutions to our customer is also evident in our acquisition of Gayston Corporation's defense operations this quarter. Gayston expands our critical manufacturing capability to more cost-efficiently produce high-precision parts on core franchise programs such as the hydro rocket, and provides us with more opportunities to participate in high-performance weapons programs. Looking ahead, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest, with each of the businesses contributing their largest volume of the year. Margins will be somewhat lower due to mix shift as our newer international vehicle and development programs accelerate, and our mature domestic vehicle production work slows. For the full year, the group remains on track to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales and mid-13% margins. Now I'll discuss Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group delivered another quarter of strong operating performance. Sales of nearly $1.7 billion were relatively stable when compared with the prior-year period as destroyer, Mobile Landing Platform and repair volume grows, and the T-AKE Program winds down. The group's repair-related sales increased primarily due to the third quarter 2011 acquisition of Norfolk-based Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO-Norfolk. Earl Industries, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2012, also enhanced the group's repair sales. Earl provides General Dynamics a role as prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier multi-ship, multi-option, MSMO, contracts, and extends the reach of our repair capabilities in the 2 major East Coast Navy ports, Norfolk and Mayport. Earnings totaled $186 million, up modestly when compared with both last year and last quarter. The group's third quarter operating margin was 11.1%, driven primarily by continued strong performance on the T-AKE Program, which will see delivery of the 14th and final ship this week. I also want to highlight that performance across several of our newer programs has been very good. In September, NASSCO completed the structural assembly and weld-out of over 26,000 tons of steel to erect the entire structure of the first MLP. Construction of this first-of-class ship is progressing on schedule and under budget with delivery plan for the second quarter of 2013. At Bath Iron Works, progress continues on Zumwalt, the first DDG 1000, which is 70% complete in manufacturing and provides a most impressive sight on BIW's waterfront. Fabrication and unit assembly on the initial DDG 51 restart ships are also underway as we demonstrate our ability to simultaneously produce 2 different types of destroyers in our main shipyard. Marine's backlog totaled nearly $16 billion at the end of the third quarter, while total estimated contract value, including backlog and unexercised options, was $17.3 billion. Orders this quarter included a $94 million award for planning activities on USS Miami, which you may recall was badly damaged by a fire earlier this year. The Navy has valued the total repair bill for their submarine at several hundred million dollars, and we anticipate additional repair work following the planning activities. Third quarter 2012 orders are well down from the year-ago period when Marine Systems booked 3 destroyers and several substantive engineering and development contracts. But as you know, this merely reflects the very lumpy nature of Marine's award contract activity, where shipbuilding awards come periodically in large tranches and provide several years of backlog. We expect several of these sizable awards next year, including the Navy's DDG 51 multi-year program and the Block IV Virginia-class submarine program. Other meaningful order activities on the horizon include the Ohio replacement class design contract and a fourth MLP ship planned for procurement in 2014. Marine Systems' fourth quarter volumes will be lower than the previous 3 as the T-AKE Program concludes, while margins will approximate year-to-date profitability. For the full year, the group remains on track to achieve 2012 sales slightly below last year with margins in the mid-11% range. Next, I'll move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group enjoyed a very successful third quarter, marked by improved order activity and the achievement of FAA type certification on our G280 and G650 aircraft. Group sales were $1.8 billion, up 30% from the year-ago period due to higher green G650 deliveries, while earnings were $261 million. Margins were 14.2%, down year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to lower Gulfstream R&D supplier payments. As a reminder, these payments vary from quarter-to-quarter and, therefore, can distort profitability comparisons. Profitability was also modestly lower at Jet Aviation this quarter, as the business works aggressively to confront overhead absorption issues exacerbated by the European debt crisis, which is impacting aircraft utilization and service work across the continent. With that said, Jet Aviation continues to take positive steps forward. In the completions business, the jet team recently delivered the fourth narrow-body, wide-body aircraft of the year and added another narrow-body to the order book. Jet service operations are seeing mixed demand, with pockets of strength in some regions and continued weakness in Europe. The leadership team at Jet is working aggressively to address this dynamic situation by optimizing our maintenance and repair footprint to better address the requirements of the installed base moving forward, with a particular focus on rightsizing facility situated in slower markets and investing in our facilities and customer outreach in growth markets. Gulfstream reported its best order quarter of the year, driven by several multi-aircraft deals placed by North American companies. Year-to-date, North American customers represent nearly 60% of Gulfstream's order book. This metric represents the resurgence of North American demand and some softening in the international demand, driven by political uncertainty in some regions and the overall negative impact of the European debt crisis on global economic sentiment. Even so, Gulfstream's international customer interest remains very healthy, and we continue to expect to solidify several multi-aircraft international deals in the coming months, as I previously mentioned. Customer defaults in the quarter were at their lowest since the economic downturn began in 2008. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated Gulfstream book-to-bill was a little over 0.8x, reflecting improved overall award activity, offset by continued G650 deliveries. The group's backlog at quarter end stood at just over $16 billion, including approximately 5 years of G650 backlog and around 18 months of G450 and 550 deliveries. As I reiterated previously, because new orders for the 650 currently have this 5-year entry into service date, we don't expect new orders to match planned deliveries in the near term. That said, our sales force booked healthy orders for the G650 and each of our other aircraft models in the third quarter. In terms of preowned, Gulfstream took 2 aircraft in trade this quarter, delivered 1 aircraft at breakeven and brokered another 1 for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, we had 3 preowned aircraft in inventory. Gulfstream's installed fleet flying hours were at pre-economic downturn levels again in the third quarter, a reality that helped our service facilities enjoy another record volume quarter. In part, this continued success reflects Gulfstream's #1 ranking in worldwide product support. In the quarter, Gulfstream product support was voted #1 for the 10th consecutive year in the Annual Aviation International News' Product Support Survey. Similarly, Gulfstream received the top service ranking in the yearly professional pilot survey. To meet growing customer demand, Gulfstream continues to invest in its product support network, including plans to open new company-owned service centers in Brazil and China. Our enhanced global service network is particularly timely as we deliver new G650s and 280s. Both aircraft are enjoying robust customer interest, following type certification, and we are proud to showcase them at the NBAA convention in Orlando next week. The fact that together, these aircraft have already amassed 6 city pair records, including one transatlantic record each, is a testament not only to the capabilities of these aircraft, but also to the entire Gulfstream team. Entry into service when we deliver these aircraft to our first customers is just weeks away. All necessary preparations to support EIS are proceeding apace, including retrofit work and pilot training. Looking to the fourth quarter, the Aerospace group expects its strongest sales quarter of the year, including entry-into-service deliveries for the 650 and 280. The composition of our planned 2012 deliveries has changed modestly. For initial stage deliveries, green deliveries, we now expect to deliver 24 G650s, that's really unchanged; 80 450s and 550s, that's up modestly; and 15 to 20 mid-cabin aircraft, that's, too, is up modestly. Planned completion deliveries for 450s and 550s and mid-cabins remain unchanged, while G650 completions will be somewhat lower than the 17 originally planned solely as a function of the later-than-anticipated type certification. For the full year, I expect Aerospace group sales to grow approximately 16% to 17%, up somewhat from my prior guidance, and operating margins to be in the mid-15% range. In summary, General Dynamics made progress on several important fronts in the third quarter, including Gulfstream type certifications and JTRS and WIN-T orders. These franchise programs are now set to realize their full market potential. Given our year-to-date performance, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $7 to $7.05. However sequestration is resolved, all of us at General Dynamics will continue to aggressively manage our businesses for profitability, with primary emphasis on nailing execution in order to maximize earnings and cash. We remain focused on affecting what we can control to include leveraging our incumbency and experience to provide our customers with affordable, dependable and proven solutions. With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd: Thank you, Jay, and good morning. I would like to cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period. First, net interest expense was $39 million for the quarter. Based on our current net debt position of $900 million, we expect net interest expense of approximately $155 million for the full year. Next, the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 31.2% for the first 9 months compared with 30.6% for the same period of 2011. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of slightly less than 32%, rising slightly over 2011's rate at 31.4% due to the less income from international locations, where the tax rates are lower, and the exploration of the R&D tax credit here in the U.S. Finally, during the quarter, we contributed approximately $321 million to our pension plans. To date, this year, we have contributed approximately $430 million to our plans, with full year funding expectation of $500 million. Amy, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it to you for the Q&A.
Amy Gilliland: Thanks, Hugh. I'd like to highlight that a summary of the guidance provided this morning will be posted on our website, alongside the webcast link. [Operator Instructions] And Greg, could you just please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Jay, I'd like to follow up on your question that you felt that the uncertainty about the outlook held you back from buying back shares this quarter, yet you still felt confident enough to make a series of acquisitions. And I could wonder how you could contrast those 2 decisions.
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I think I've been fairly consistent in saying that one of the things we're trying to do right now is shepherd our cash, and I'm trying to provide my successor with as much cash as I can. So why the acquisitions? I said before, and I'll repeat it here, that we always are looking for acquisitions that make sense for our businesses. And when you take a longer view of what these acquisitions can provide, it takes you through the trough we're dealing with here into another space where we believe these things, as I said in my remarks, will give us significant opportunities. They weren't -- they were priced right when they come to market. You got to take them if you want to build that business, and that's exactly what we did in all 4 cases. So it's setting them up for longer-term opportunities, and we felt that was appropriate.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: But isn't there a possibility these assets might have been cheaper if you'd waited maybe a few more months, 6 months, perhaps, until the sequester kicks in?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, maybe, maybe not, or they may not have been there. So they made sense for us at the time and we took them with no apologies.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And Jay, just want to wish you all the best as you I'm sure do something that's not just sitting around, but not doing what you're doing today. So all the best from all of us. I had a quick question and just a clarification on something you said earlier. I think you recall the big contract that Vangent has with CMS is in recompete. I wondered if you might update us on where that stands and what the expectations are for award and what sort of impacts that may have. And then a clarification of your comments on Abrams sort of short-term, long-term and as you think about the Lima facility. Is it correct to assume that since you had committee support and were operating under a CR, this is a sort of wait and see what happens with the election and the budget outlook before we know, ultimately, what will happen with that program?
Jay L. Johnson: Okay. The latter first. As I said, we're fairly confident -- well, let me back up. The ECP1, as it is called, which I alluded to in my remarks, the long-term Abrams R&D contract, was very important to lock down, if you will, the long view on the Abrams. So we'll be working that on the engineering development side as we approach the 2017 time frame. But in the interim, as I said, it's really important to keep that facility in the industrial base intact, if you will. The 2012 budget supports Abrams through 2013, and what we believe will come out of the 2013 budget will push that out, at least, another year. That's kind of -- so are we taking it a year at a time in this instance? Absolutely. But we're all sight-lining to the 2017 longer view. So we're confident with the support we have, and so that will work itself out here in the coming months, okay? In addition to that, and recall I believe we've talked about this before, but we have international work that also will reside at that facility with the Moroccan tanks, which we expect the order by the end of the year or shortly thereafter, and we've got the Israel Namer Merkava hulls. We've got the Egyptian kits. So we've got a number of international programs that work through that facility as well. So our view is that, that we're getting the requisite support we need, and we'll do everything we can to keep that facility very functional for, as we've discussed many times, it's actually more about the supply chain than it is about General Dynamics with the 560-some suppliers that are tied to the Lima facility that we cannot afford to lose. So that, I think, perhaps answers the tank. The Vangent beneficiary call center, I believe I'm correct here, and Amy nods her head, that this will take place now next year. So we continue to work, we continue to execute, but the contract recompete will be at some point in 2013, which is a change. They pushed it out, but we continue to work since we're the incumbent.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I was interested on Gulfstream. When you talk about the G650 and the fact that your backlog extends 5 years out, could you just refresh us on the rate plans for that? Because what I'm trying to understand is when you look at that 5-year backlog, what would lead you to raise rate? Is that limited by demand, limited by operational considerations? How do you look at that?
Jay L. Johnson: I mean, I guess, my answer, serious answer would be kind of all of the above. But we have -- as I mentioned, we continue to take orders for the 650. We're working through the production side now to get entry into service in the coming weeks. So we're hitting our battle rhythm or our flow, if you will. And as I said many times, the production, the delivery schedule, if you will, of record has 24 green deliveries this year and adding nominally 10 to 15 a year for the next few years with completion deliveries at 17, 33 and 33. Now I've just mentioned the 17 will change a little bit because of the lateness of the type certification. But nonetheless, the point is, that's the program of record, if you will. To change that, to wick it up, based on the demand, based on the 5-year backlog is certainly something we are desirous of doing, but we're not going to turn the rheostat up until we've hit, as I call it, our battle rhythm, and we're just not there yet.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: It looks like -- I mean, certainly, internally, you would have the capability to do that. And I just was trying to understand if you saw -- sort of what time frame you might see supply chain limitations? Or when could the flexibility occur to take that rate up?
Jay L. Johnson: I mean, my view of that is probably if you look at what we've got now and the work that's taking place to complete the airplanes that have been green delivered and to get the flow going, okay, because of the late type certification, my sense of that is it will take probably another year or so to work that flow out smoothly and then, again, hit what I would call a steady production rate that's -- that then is capable of being accelerated.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Jay, best of luck to you. If I look at Combat and the backlog, if I just look at what has been historically a backlog-to-sales ratio there, it's run well above one. If you look at the backlog today in the sales, say, it's right around one, which would seem to imply, obviously, you've talked about orders that could come through, through the rest of the year, but would seem to imply what could be a significant drop off still to come over the next 12 to 18 months. Could you just address that, Jay, and what we might be looking at Combat here over the near-term?
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, I mean, look, I'm not going to try to project the 2013 plan for Combat because we -- that's what's being worked right now as is our methodology every year. But the comment I'd make ties back to what we were talking about earlier with Abrams. We've got -- we know domestically, and I mentioned this in my remarks, what's the size and shape of the force ultimately going to be as things get re-cocked here as a function of the Afghanistan return and the reshape based on sequestration or no, and all of these things get sorted out. So how that force shapes itself will have impact on Combat quite obviously. So domestically, it comes down to the Stryker, which we talked about. Abrams, which we've talked about. It comes down to ground combat vehicle. It comes down to AMPV replacements, things like that, that will -- were an integral part of either competing for or are already doing all of those things. How that shapes itself is yet to be determined. We're confident in the longer view, as I said earlier, on Abrams. Stryker, we've got work to do, but we're very encouraged by the exchange program of the double-Vs, as I mentioned in my remarks. And we're fairly confident that they're going to continue converting -- we will continue converting flat bottoms to double-Vs. But the long-term opportunity on the domestic side will become more granular, I would say, frankly, within the next 6 to 8 months as we determine what's going to happen at the end of the year or the start of 2013. The international space, though, is really significant business for us. And as you've heard me say before, the projections there increased that as a part of combat's portfolio going forward. Both tanks, Light Armored Vehicles -- and those are the 2 primary movers, no pun intended, but we've got between the Middle East, Morocco, Israel, the Canadian LAV program, there's significant opportunities there for us going forward. So combat's going to have, as I mentioned before, we're integral to the force. We'll stay integral to the force. Exactly how that shapes itself will be determined, I think, in the coming months and year.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And on 650, do you expect to have any completed deliveries this year? And can you give us a little bit more color on exactly what's going on there?
Jay L. Johnson: Sure, yes. I mean it won't be 17. It will be slightly less than that, but yes, we will have 650s delivered here within the next few weeks. I think the first 2 pilot classes, or the first 1 for sure is done. So then you have to go -- there's more to do with the FAA, you got to get certificate of airworthiness for each of the aircraft. So we're marching along smartly, but yes, indeed, we'll be delivering aircraft here within weeks. Anxious to do it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: I was wondering if you'd give a little more clarity on what R&D -- how much lower R&D or higher R&D was this year versus last year. And also sequentially, just so I can get a feel for, how much that hurt the operating margin. And also, was the completions business worse than the second quarter in terms of its loss? And how did it compare year-over-year, because I know it lost money last year as well.
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, I think my answer to the latter is, I think, it was about the same, pretty nominally close at least. That's off the top of my head, George. Your R&D question, it's interesting. If I look at the stream of R&D at Gulfstream across the year, it sounds like the way I described the backlog at the Marine group. It's very lumpy, and that's exactly what this is. And, oh, by the way, it just happens that the year-ago quarter and the sequential quarter were the lumpiest. So it just -- what can I do? That's just the way it hit. And almost by a factor of like 3.5 or 4:1. So it just -- that really is it. I mean, the margin impact derives -- there's a little bit, as I think I said in my remarks, that you could attribute to jet absorption costs but -- and some for liquidated damages, but that's in the noise, quite honestly. It really is the R&D and it's purely a function of the comparators.
George Shapiro: Okay. And I wondered if I could get one last one in here. If you took out the 650, was the book-to-bill for the other planes, the 550, 450, at 1 or above 1, because you had mentioned the backlog was 18 months and, I think, in previous times, you said 18 to 24 months. So was looking for some clarity on that.
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, I mean, I'll put it this way, and you know I always -- I look at it in backlog months as you just described. And we really are kind of closer to the 18 side of it right now. But I'm not that concerned, I'm not concerned at all about that, but it's interesting. We expect, as I mentioned in my remarks, back to my favorite word today, lumpy, but we expect some multi-aircraft orders that were there last year about this time that haven't manifested themselves this year at this time, which will help put that backlog out even further. But I'm very comfortable kind at the 18-month point right now. And we're selling the mix of aircraft. I mentioned this was a great orders quarter for us, the mix of aircraft covered the spectrum of all of them, really, but almost equally weighted in the 450, 550, 650, 280, and a little lighter on the 150. So that's a good story as far as I'm concerned.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that it's taking longer for deals to close in the global environment, it's a little bit different. I mean, can you give some color on that, right, because I guess globally corporate profits are pretty good, right? And it seems like North America is getting a little bit better. If you can just give some more detail maybe just around the broad business jet environment.
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, I mean, North America has been very -- is very strong this year. And we're at about -- let me, okay, we're at about 59%, I believe I said, of the backlog for this year-to-date is North American. So the pent-up demand in North America is being serviced. Within that, I should add, consistent with earlier comments I've made, that the Fortune 500, as part of that, is back, which is, I think, very good for everyone. We are seeing internationally, if you look at the whole backlog, backlog writ large, it's still about 60% international, okay? I was talking about 2012's inject into that. 60% international, but it's fair to say that we're seeing, not surprisingly, less activity in Europe and less activity in Asia Pacific believing that to be, frankly, I think, tied to things like the government transition in China and just some slowness in bringing orders to the fore. We anticipate, as I said in my remarks, getting several multi-aircraft orders out of the international space in the coming months. So the dialogue and the interest level is still there. It's the translation into orders that's not occurring. And as I think, maybe we mentioned in the last call, there's also -- in the financing world, there seems to be more of a requirement, if you're going to finance your aircraft, that you have to get the financing locked in before you order the aircraft, which wasn't the case in earlier times. So that's going to -- those are the big points.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then can I ask just a follow-on, on defense, if that's okay. When you look at the current budget environment and all the uncertainty, I mean, maybe I'll put you on the spot, right? What do you think the odds of sequestration actually playing through are? And I mean, how do you think about that when you plan for the company?
Jay L. Johnson: I wouldn't even place that bet with your money, Ron. You just -- I mean, there is no one on earth who can answer that question with any precision right now. As I mentioned in my remarks, there's a lot of activity and chatter and handwringing and concern and angst, you pick the word, but until we sit down as a government and decide we're going to solve this before the 2nd of January, 2013, it's the law of the land, and it will execute. So planning for that is very difficult, as I mentioned. So our team, I'm sure, is working with Phebe to develop the plan for 2013 based on all the information we have at our disposal. And then you have to be prepared, I think, to be able to stay agile enough to re-cock if you have to. And what that means right now, nobody really knows. So you've heard me talking, I think I said it in my remarks this morning, it's still about, for us, you prepare for that strange outcome that nobody can define just a few months ahead by staying agile, staying lean, cutting cost and not losing your discipline in terms of your ability to execute. And then you're as prepared as anybody can be, and that's what we are.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Jay, best of luck to you as well. One question on -- just a clarification, and then one on the IS&T business. On the clarification point, the guidance, I just want to make sure, includes the charge that you took in IS&T this quarter?
Jay L. Johnson: Affirmative.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I'm sorry?
Jay L. Johnson: That's affirmative.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. And then on IS&T, lots of commentary here, the charge being related to a specific program, you also made some commentary about maybe you need some changing strategy or approach to the IS&T business. Can you just give us a sense of whether this changing strategy is going to have an impact on revenues as well as margins? Because it sounds like, from a margin perspective, it's going to have a positive impact, but the revenue outlook on this kind of changing tack wasn't quite as clear.
Jay L. Johnson: Well, the write-down didn't have to do with a specific program, if that's what you're alluding to. I mean it was -- we're moving out of that commoditized, ruggedized computer business and putting our efforts where it makes more sense for our customers right now. That was a business that was driven by price with lots of big competitors and frankly, it's not a space we need to stay in. That's what that was all about. The top line impact of all of that, I think, been reflected in our results over the last year or so. So I don't see any strategic shift other than what I've just described there.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. So what was the revenue run rate of that business that you're now exiting?
Jay L. Johnson: We don't even -- I don't even break it down that way.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, so not material.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Jay, on the Aerospace margins, I hear you on the lumpiness of the R&D. It strikes me that, that's probably lumpiness of the offsetting supplier contributions rather than your engineering spend. And so...
Jay L. Johnson: That's affirmative. That is correct, Joe.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And so the question is, since that's probably fairly predictable, it's contractual, and you have your R&D plan set looking forward, can you give some color on the profile, is it going to look more like Q2 or more like Q3? Have we ended some chain of payments, or any kind of color you can provide on that?
Jay L. Johnson: I'm smiling because I wish it were so in terms of the predictability of the supplier launch assistance, as we call it, but it isn't really that predictable. So I don't have a stream I can give you except to say that our R&D investment is, as you well know, is constant and committed, and they feed into that at varying intervals and we just saw 2 big lumps, the comparators this time. But I don't have a stream out ahead of me that I can describe for you today. There will be more, obviously, as we go, and we're always in product development. So targeting 2% to 3% of Gulfstream sales and -- as our benchmark.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And that's for a net R&D?
Jay L. Johnson: Affirmative.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just on the 550, 450 rate, you're at the lower end of your -- but confident, like you say, in orders coming. If those orders don't come, would there be any consideration to lowering that rate of 80 aircraft? Or are you just lock set, no problem at all for 2013 right now?
Jay L. Johnson: No. Well, first of all, we haven't -- we're not giving 2013 guidance. But in general terms to your point, we're not going to keep producing airplanes if we don't have the demand for them. I mean, we believe the demand will be there, and so we rate to that. But we don't keep the rate going if the demand isn't there. So but I'm very confident in both the 450 and the 550. I'd say 2013 looks pretty good. I'm just not prepared, and it's not fair, frankly, to Phebe, for me to say, Well, here's what I think it's going to be in numbers. We're just not there yet. But I anticipate -- when I listen to the earnings call next time, I anticipate hearing that the Gulfstream projection is a good one.
Amy Gilliland: And I think we have time for just one more question this morning.
Operator: Okay, thank you, Amy. Our final question, then, comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So Jay, I'm going to add my sentiments for good luck to you as well. A question I have is on IS&T. I was wondering if you could give us some -- flesh out a bit kind of the color that you're seeing on contract terms and margin outlook? And how should we think about the trends that you see emerging ahead sort of division by division, if you don't mind, putting a finer point on it. Just again, I know you don't want to provide guidance, but just so we can kind of think about it looking ahead, most competitively vulnerable division that you have?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, let's take a whack at it this way, Heidi. We've got -- the most impact we're seeing right now is in the short cycle businesses, a.k.a. IS&T. That's a blinding flash of the obvious. But in point of fact, within that, you recall earlier discussions, we talked about the mix within IS&T, and the service mix has increased from, my memory thinks maybe it was in the 20%, 20s back some couple 3 years ago is now almost half of IS&T's business. So there's a margin reality that's attached to that. Oh, by the way, our IS&T folks in that space have done a tremendous job of executing at good profitability. But that's a reality that's there, okay? There's more service work. The tactical communications business, which is significant for us, most out of our C4 Systems business, I alluded to it I think once or twice in my remarks, but what we're seeing there now, all of a -- not all of a sudden, we're finally getting the volume coming back to us, but the mix within that volume is less on the higher margin encryption type products and more on more moderate margin things. But we do have the franchise programs in there. WIN-T and JTRS, which have taken perhaps longer than originally anticipated. But in both cases, those franchise programs are building now and, within the next year, will build even further. So we're very encouraged for that, and that will be significant business going forward for C4 Systems, but for IS&T and General Dynamics. So we've had -- we've seen award delays, I've talked about that. We've seen descoping. We've seen a lot of the lowest price technically acceptable, which is, in Jay Johnson's opinion, not very helpful to anybody in the long term, but -- and then we've seen increased competition. So those are all factors that are upon the IS&T world. The long-term view for IS&T, for us, is a very healthy one. They are just a short-cycle business, the most impacted by kind of where we are in the world right now, dealing with what's right ahead of us in the next 6 months.
Amy Gilliland: And thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3748. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2012 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President, Investor Relations. And you have the floor, ma'am.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson: Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' second quarter delivered $7.9 billion in sales and $970 million in operating earnings at a 12.2% operating margin, improvement from last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter. Earnings per share totaled $1.77 on a fully diluted basis, $0.20 ahead of last quarter. Second quarter free cash flow, after capital expenditures, totaled $703 million or 111% of earnings from continuing operations. This result was particularly strong, considering that it includes approximately $100 million in pension fund contribution, 2 quarterly federal tax payments and continued investment in Gulfstream's Savannah campus. We plan to contribute about $500 million in total to our pension plans this year with most of the remainder in the third quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $1 billion or 86% of earnings from continuing operations. On the capital deployment front, we took advantage of our healthy balance sheet and tough market conditions to repurchase 7.8 million shares of common stock this quarter. Through the first half, we have repurchased 9.1 million shares. Additionally, we had announced the acquisition of IPWireless, an excellent bolt-on addition for our IS&T business. IPWireless further expands our technical communications portfolio into the public safety first responder market with advanced broadband technology that improves first responders' effectiveness and safety by providing them with greater access to information. Orders this quarter were approximately $5.2 billion, reflecting continued sluggishness in defense award activity and some slower-than-anticipated order timing in Aerospace. I do anticipate improved second-half orders, particularly in Aerospace. At the end of the quarter, funded backlog was $43.9 billion while total backlog stood at $52.4 billion. Total estimated contract value, which includes opportunities to provide products and services under IDIQ contracts and options, was $78.6 billion. Before I turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, I want to comment on what we are seeing in this dynamic aerospace and defense business environment. In our U.S. defense market, visibility remains somewhat limited by 3 principal factors: the upcoming elections, a likely 2013 continuing resolution and the sequestration trigger. The uncertainty and anxiety spawned by these second-half events continues to impede Department of Defense and federal government acquisition program execution. As was the case last quarter, our shorter-cycle IS&T business is experiencing the most pressure, due primarily to award delays on several of our key tactical communications contracts. In most cases, these are funded programs of record. While there are -- excuse me, while there was improvement in activity from first to second quarter, this order activity did not meet our expectations. As anticipated, we are witnessing increased rhetoric as the summer progresses and the political process prepares to navigate the final months of the campaign trail. As we steam towards the sequestration fogbank, many members of Congress have begun talking more seriously about sequestration and its potential impacts. We remain hopeful that a bipartisan solution can be brokered. However, as a practical matter, it seems increasingly unlikely that we will see additional detail on implementation or resolution before the November elections. We are focused on what we can control. Specifically, we're executing on our backlog; working with our customers to jump-start the expenditure of previously appropriated funds; talking with our suppliers; analyzing our contract terms and conditions; and judiciously husbanding our capital resources. Nevertheless, forecasting our customer's behavior has become increasingly difficult. Given this uncertainty, we have adjusted our expectations somewhat for the year. Our outlook does assume the obligation of previously appropriated funds on several of our programs where delays have been prominent. With that said, the 2013 defense budget request is proceeding through the congressional approval process. We've been pleased with the support our programs have received to date. In the likely event that the 2013 Pentagon budget is funded, at least for some period of time through a continuing resolution, our programs would reflect relatively healthy 2012 funding levels. In our Aerospace group, Gulfstream continues to enjoy a sizable, multi-year large cabin backlog in a robust order pipeline. The fidelity of our backlog is evidenced by the extremely limited default of activity this quarter. And point of fact, this was the lowest default quarter since the economic downturn began in 2008. We are seeing, however, some elongation of our business jet order cycle with a number of factors causing deal closure times to increase. In part, order delays, most of which materialize late in the quarter, reflect the decline in global economic sentiment. We continue to believe that we will realize many of these orders although their timing, and in some cases, their scope, may vary from initial discussions. Now let me turn to each of our groups, starting with Combat Systems. Combat Systems' sales and earnings improved this quarter when compared with last quarter and the second of 2011. Sales totaled $2.15 billion, reflecting growing FMS volume for vehicles and tanks, initial progress on the Ground Combat Vehicle program and the addition of Force Protection. Abrams tank volume and European Land Systems volume were down somewhat as expected. The group's earnings were $322 million, resulting in 15% operating margins. This operating margin reflects excellent performance across Combats' portfolio of mature domestic vehicle production programs. In addition, profitability continues to be enhanced by ongoing continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives. Combat Systems backlog totaled $9.8 billion at quarter end. Although the group's orders improved from last quarter, orders in Combats' weapon systems and European vehicles segments were somewhat lighter than anticipated due to several international program delays. Notable orders that were received included approximately $270 million for Hydra rockets, $170 million for Abrams upgrades and support, and $115 million for Stryker double-V-hull conversions and logistics support. The Stryker double-V-hull conversion order is particularly significant as it reaffirms the customer's acceptance of the life-saving benefit of the double-V-hull and begins the process of converting another brigade of Strykers to the double-V configuration. In the second half, we expect order activity to improve with additional awards for Strykers, MRAP enhancements and international tank upgrades for several Middle Eastern customers to include 200 tanks from Morocco. We also expect a significant Abrams award that will fund tank research and development activities over the next several years. This investment is proof of our customer's long-term commitment to investing in and modernizing this integral component of the Army's fighting force. The Abrams tank also continues to receive staunch congressional support with each of the 3 committees that is marked, thus far, adding funds to sustain Abrams production. This support will help ensure that the U.S. maintains a healthy and reliable tank industrial base. Combat is on track to achieve my guidance of around $8.5 billion in sales this year. A variety of drivers in our European Land Systems business including reduced profitability on several vehicle programs, delays in several international awards, and absorption impact from lower-than-anticipated volume will cause the group's earnings to be somewhat lower than anticipated. Consequently, the group's operating margins will likely be closer to the mid-13% range. Next, Marine Systems. Marine Systems delivered another very solid quarter. Sales and earnings at $1.7 billion and $183 million, respectively, were up for the group collectively and at all 3 shipyards when compared with the prior year periods. Marine's stronger sales performance reflects higher submarine and destroyer volume, partially offset by lower T-AKE volume when compared with last year's second quarter. The group's repair-related sales also increased in the quarter, due primarily to our third quarter 2011 acquisition of Norfolk-based Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO-Norfolk. Integration of this acquisition is going well, and we continue to be excited about naval ship repair opportunities. In order to better leverage this growth market, in the second quarter, we announced our intent to acquire the Ship Repair and Coatings Divisions of Earl Industries. Earl will provide General Dynamics a role as prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier, multi-ship, multi-option contracts, MSMOs; further enhance our ability to deliver cost-effective repair and maintenance service on both coasts; and extend the reach of our repair capabilities in the 2 major East Coast Navy ports, Norfolk and Mayport. Group margins in the quarter improved 90 basis points over last year's second quarter to 11.1%, driven primarily by strong performance on the T-AKE program. Our 3 shipyards were busy delivering ships to our Navy customers in the second quarter including T-AKE 13; the USNS Medgar Evers; DDG 112; USS Michael Murphy, the final ship in the original DDG 51 program; and SSN 782, the USS Mississippi, the ninth Virginia-class submarine. The group's backlog was $17 billion at quarter end including several key new orders such as a $65 million contract to provide planning yard services for DDG 51 class destroyers and FFG 7 class frigates and the $80 million contract to purchase long lead materials for the next block, Block IV, of 9 Virginia-class submarines. We are currently preparing our bid for Block IV, expected later this -- next year, excuse me, and the SSBN replacement program design contract, which should be awarded by year end. We also recently submitted our bid for the Navy's DDG 51 multiyear program. This 9-ship contract, which includes an option for a 10th ship, is expected to be awarded early next year. Other opportunities for the group include additional repair work and the potential for some Jones Act commercial ships. Overall, 2012 sales should be modestly below 2011, consistent with my prior guidance. Given the group's performance through the first half, Marine margins for the year should be in the low 11% range, somewhat better than my earlier guidance. Now to IS&T. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, our IS&T group was challenged again in the second quarter as customer award activity continued to fall short of expectations. Group sales were $2.5 billion while earnings were $226 million, up modestly from first quarter but off slightly from our expectations. Similar to the first quarter, volume weakness was driven by shortfalls in our tactical communications business. Last quarter, I highlighted the 3 areas which were causing weakness in our communications business. Award delays in our shorter-cycle products, especially encryption hardware; a slower-than-anticipated transition to the Common Hardware Systems-4 program; and the sluggish ramp in several programs moving from development to production, most notably JTRS and WIN-T. We made some progress on encryption orders in the second quarter, although we did not completely meet our forecast. We do expect good third quarter encryption volume, particularly as the government's fourth physical -- fiscal quarter has historically been a strong award period for our short-cycle products. The CHS-4 program was again a driver of the group's volume weakness in the second quarter, although improved somewhat from the first quarter. As a reminder, this is a $3.7 billion, 5-year single-source IDIQ contract that purchases from across the military and other government agencies and used to acquire the latest ruggedized commercial computing and communications technology. Slowing operational tempo has impacted demand when compared with the prior contracts. However, current customer demand far outpaces the orders we have received year-to-date. We have lowered our full year expectations for this contract, but believe that orders will improve somewhat in the second half. On development programs, our JTRS HMS and WIN-T programs continued to demonstrate their capability in the quarter, including participating in the Army's recent Network Integration Evaluation. While test reports are still preliminary, we have every reason to believe that our HMS Manpack and WIN-T Increment 2 products performed extremely well. Similarly, our HMS Rifleman radio received Pentagon approval for procurement of another 13,000 radios. Despite the demonstrated success and progress of our programs, the obligation of funding and awards for these programs continues to fall behind program or record time line. We are working closely with our customer on these issues and continue to expect to receive FY '12 funded awards for WIN-T as well as Rifleman and Manpack radios in the second half. Volume in our IT service business was essentially flat this quarter as the addition of several businesses in 2011 offset lower workload on several major IT infrastructure support projects, which have concluded. IS&T operating margins were 8.9% in the second quarter. This result reflects the lack of award activity in our higher-return, product-oriented tactical communications business and the overall portfolio mix shift toward service work that I mentioned in the first quarter call. IS&T, like the rest of our businesses, remain focused on profitability and competitiveness. The group continues to be aggressive in targeting costs to include facility consolidations, restructuring a business unit and staffing reductions. These actions should afford some operating leverage when delayed volume returns. The group's backlog totaled $9.3 billion at the quarter end while total estimated contract value, which includes backlog and potential IDIQ awards totaled $31 billion. Order activity was particularly healthy at our IT services business this quarter with several new opportunities captured to serve a wide range of customers including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and NATO. Even amidst a slower order cadence, our tactical communications business captured several key adjacent market wins including a $365 million 10-year IDIQ contract to replace the FAA's air-to-ground radios and a $385 million 10-year IDIQ contract to replace the Army's outdated fleet of range radar systems. These wins diversify our tactical communications end markets moving forward and highlight our focus on seeking new opportunities where we can apply our core competencies. IS&T's proposal activity remains quite robust, and we are maintaining our new capture rates. While forecasting remains extremely challenging in this market, we anticipate book-to-bill to improve in the second half and full year book-to-bill to approximate 1x. In light of the group's first half results, I expect full year sales to be down 7% when compared with last year. This revised outlook, which assumes just over $500 million of incremental volume in the second half, reflects the realities we experienced in the first half and our best estimate of how our customers will behave in the second half. Most of the incremental volume will come from our IST -- excuse me, our IT services business, including a significant portion that is in backlog today. As tactical communications volume improves in the second half, I would expect margins to expand from the 9% level achieved in the first half to yield full year group margins around 9.3%. Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group's second quarter sales were $1.6 billion, up 16% from the year ago quarter, due primarily to green G650 deliveries. When compared with the first quarter, revenues were down modestly due to the timing of several large-cabin aircraft deliveries. Earnings totaled $257 million, resulting in a 16.1% group operating margin. The group's operating margins improved 90 basis points when compared with last year's period, due to both improved results at Jet Aviation and excellent performance at Gulfstream. A variety of factors including mix and rightsizing actions taken at Jet caused margins to contract 60 basis points sequentially. Jet Aviation continues to make positive progress. In the quarter, we delivered the remaining 2 narrow-body wide-body aircraft that had experienced significant cost growth. And in an effort to continue improving its competitiveness, Jet reorganized its Basel operations, which resulted in further employee reductions. The Jet leadership team remains focused on capturing new completions opportunities. Jet's service operations continue to do well to include modest volume improvement from the year ago period and flat revenues sequentially. This performance reflects the dichotomy of increased demand across some markets, such as Asia, and decreased maintenance repair demand in Europe as the region copes with continued economic uncertainty. We've taken a hard look at our European service operations and are taking appropriate actions to reshape that footprint. As we look forward, Jet's global service footprint remains a strategic advantage for our Aerospace group. In the very near term, Jet's London Biggin Hill FBO, the closest business aviation airport to the Olympic Park, has already seen an increase in traffic from visitors to the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. Broader aerospace market indicators were mixed this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, orders were softer than expected due to the timing with second quarter gross new aircraft book-to-bill at 0.6x on a dollar-denominated basis. When combined with continued G650 deliveries, this elongation of the order cycle caused the group's backlog to decline to approximately $16.3 billion. While lower, this healthy backlog continues to keep us in an 18- to 24-month delivery window for our G450 and G550 products, and G650 backlog remains approximately 5 years in duration. As I've mentioned previously, because new orders for the G650 currently have this 5-year entry into service date, we do not expect new orders to match planned deliveries the near term. Through the first half, orders reflect the relative resilience of the large-cabin market when compared with mid-cabin. North American customers comprised 60% of the order book year-to-date, reflecting the return of some of our North American customers and some cooling of international demand, particularly in Asia. Gulfstream flying hours were at prerecession levels, pretty healthy, consistent with the first quarter. Year-to-date, Bellstream and Jet Aviation services are up almost 5%. We continue to work diligently to ensure that our service network remains well-positioned to serve customers in the growing install global fleet. In pursuit of this goal, we continue to improve our Field and Airborne Support Teams, our FAST teams. These teams, which were created a decade ago to provide 24/7 customer service support, just celebrated their 3,000 mission flight. In the quarter, we announced the addition of mobile maintenance vehicles to the FAST capability set. These vehicles will provide a range of services to customers in targeted markets. Preowned aircraft on the market continued to slowly decline in the quarter. We had 1 aircraft in inventory at the beginning of this quarter, took 1 additional preowned in trade during the quarter and had both aircraft available for sale at quarter end. On the product development front, the G650 and G280 development programs continued to make progress in the second quarter. Both aircraft set city-pair records en route to EBACE in Geneva in May. The G280 has now completed all of its FAA flying and we're working through the final stages of certification. We are nearly complete with the FAA's required G650 flight testing and remain on track to obtain a third quarter type certification. We continue to believe that we can attain our objective of delivering about 24 green G650 aircraft this year and around 17 completions with most of these completions happening in the fourth quarter. For the year, I expect the group sales to grow approximately 15% in line with my prior guidance, as large- and mid-cabin in-production green deliveries plan for the year remain on track at just over 100 and 10 to 15, respectively. Margins will be in the mid-15% range, somewhat higher than previously expected given Gulfstream's strong performance through the first half. In summary, General Dynamics executed very well this quarter and I expect that performance to continue in the second half. However, given first half results and the difficult reality of forecasting for IS&T in this uncertain period, I'm adjusting my EPS range to $7 to $7.10. As is our practice, this guidance does not presume further deployment of capital. We have a lot of work to accomplish in the second half as we deal with the defense uncertainties before us, achieve G650 and G280 type certification and begin detailed planning for 2013. With these tasks ahead, Phebe Novakovic, who, as you know, will assume my role as Chairman and CEO at the beginning of next year, is concentrating her efforts on the operation of this corporation and our 2013 planning process. Amidst this decidedly dynamic business climate, all of us at General Dynamics remain laser-focused on the things we can control and on doing what we do best: executing. And with that, I'll ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Really just 3 quick points before the question-and-answer period. First, net interest expense was $37 million for the quarter versus $31 million in 2011. For 2012, we expect net interest expense of approximately $155 million, reflecting the full year impact of our fixed rate notes issued in July of 2011. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $1 billion of net debt. Second, I'd like to point out an item impacting the comparability of our results, that being the sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of 2011. This sale resulted in a pretax gain of $38 million or about $0.07 in other income. Finally, the effective tax rate was 31.5% for the first 6 months compared with 30.8% for the same period in 2011. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, rising slightly over the 2011 amount, but due primarily to the absence of the R&D tax credit for 2012 but also due to less income from international locations where the tax rates are lower. Amy, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the question-and-answer.
Amy Gilliland: [Operator Instructions] Jeff, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Jay, your comments on the second half of book-to-bill improvement that you expect in Aerospace, can you give a little more color as to the level of confidence there in terms of you're seeing more pre-order traffic or kicking the tires, and specifically what regions are showing that pickup? And then kind of as a caveat to that, you -- at least I interpreted that there were some, I'm not sure, it's process procedural delays maybe in the quarter in terms of orders getting over the finish line, if you can clarify that a little bit?
Jay L. Johnson: Okay, be happy to. We did -- let me say it this way. We believe the second-half order activity will be stronger, as I said in my remarks. Example, let me just talk to demographics: 60% of our first quarter -- our first-half orders came from North America. Within that set, we had several, shall we say, multi-aircraft fleet buys, if you will, that moved out of the quarter; not off the page, just out of the quarter. And we anticipate those to be with us in the order book before the end of the year. And really, that probably had as much to do with North America with the order circumstance, if you will, as anything. So last year, just to further comment on North America, last year, at the midyear, about 28% as I recall, of our orders were North American. And as I said before, 60% this year. So the North American market, at large, is becoming a bigger part of our order book, which we like a lot. Conversely, we saw great softness in Europe, not unexpected by anyone and some in Asia, which frankly, we attribute at this stage more to timing than anything. What does that mean? That means, this year -- I don't have the exact percentage in my head, but last year's midyear order book was like 49% Asia Pacific and this year it was down in the high teens, as I recall. So there has been some cooling, as I said in my remarks. But again, we had a lot of fleet activity last year that hasn't manifested itself yet this year, but because of ongoing discussions, et cetera, we have -- we believe that there will be more activity coming out of Asia in the second half is probably the cleanest way to say it.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Do you think it's enough to make book-to-bill 1 for the second half?
Jay L. Johnson: Probably not. Remember, too, Myles, in my -- as I said in my remarks, the 1:1 book-to-bill is going to be challenged right now because we're working off the 650 backlog. So I look, primarily, at what my delivery window is and I'm still very comfortable today in the 18- to 24-month for the 450 and the 550, and as I said, well out in excess of that for the 650. So I think that answers your question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Jay, I wanted to ask you 2 questions on 2 specific programs. First, I wondered if you might speak to why you think Textron won the TAPV program. And then secondly, following up on your IS&T technical comments, can you elaborate on WIN-T? Is there anything materially unexpected or sort of out of line on that program going on?
Jay L. Johnson: Okay. I don't really have a comment on TAPV, Noah. I don't know, I mean. But I wish them well and I would say that we are in the hunt to compete for the CCV and we're already in execution on $1 billion of the LAV III upgrades with the Canadian DND so we've got plenty work to do, and we see more work out ahead. In terms of WIN-T, look, it's the stated #1 priority for our Army customer. So in macro terms, we feel very good about WIN-T and the performance of our pieces based on the NIE 12.2 are very encouraging. So it's back to my T word -- my T word, which is timing and we anticipate getting awards in the second half of this year. We just don't have them yet, okay? We expect a full rate production decision, I think, it's in September, either late August or September. So best we can tell that's still on track, but it hasn't, obviously, come yet. But we are very pleased and I believe the Army customer is very pleased with the performance of our pieces of WIN-T.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Have there been any design or specification issues with any other contributors to the program? Just trying to discern why this is getting held up.
Jay L. Johnson: None that I'm aware of. Honestly, I -- and I may be -- I don't want to presume to speak for the Army customer here, but maybe I will a little bit and my -- I'll just give you my impression of some of this, is that they're trying to align all of these programs, WIN-T and JTRS, into the NIE sequence and those don’t happen but every so often. So I think, honestly, that's caused some of the delay in some of the award activity. That's the best -- my best sense of it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Jay, just a question on the Aerospace and business jets. I just wanted to know -- you noted some pretty strong pricing previously. I just want to know if you could discuss maybe pricing for large-cabin and mid-cabin jets, especially since you're thinking about stronger order activity in the second half?
Jay L. Johnson: The way I characterize it, Rich, is that the large-cabin pricing is very resilient and the mid-cabin pricing, I think this is industry-wide, is very competitive, and shall we say, less resilient.
Operator: Our your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just a question on IS&T. Just thinking about kind of the different buckets that you're involved in. I know that you've commented on the delays within some of the products in the networking area. What are you seeing -- I mean on the services front, we've seen a lot of delays. Can you bucket it in terms of the customer mix, DoD or intel or is it all across-the-board within civil agencies also?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, our services business has been -- they've done pretty well in what I consider a really tough environment. Good award activity in the quarter, I think I mentioned that, but -- and we've got probably about -- I think I've got about 45% to 47% of our IS&T sales are coming out of services now. About 21 or 22% of that out of what I call pure IT services and then probably another 25% coming out of engineering services, but that segment has been pressured for 18 to 24 months now. But I'd say, as I started this answer, again, we're competing very well in a tough environment. We are seeing some of the awards move to the right. We are seeing some down-scoping or re-scoping of those awards, but we're maintaining our capture rates and I think we're very competitive. You've got, in addition to that, the lowest-priced technically acceptable reality, which I think we've talked about before that's out there, that puts a lot of pressure on the system. So in a pretty decent catfight, I think our IT services business is doing very well.
Jay L. Johnson: Yes. Do you need -- I know that you had presence in all 50 states and certainly internationally on the footprint side. Are there consolidation opportunities there to help preserve the margins?
Jay L. Johnson: Sure, sure. They're looking at that all, in doing that, all of them. It's interesting, the consolidations and the re-scoping and the reshaping that I mentioned in my remarks, I mean that is a reality across all of our businesses right now as they deal with the realities of the defense market that has taken a $487 billion reduction across the 10 years and that doesn't even get into the sequestration discussion, so that's just good business. So as I've always said, we manage for profitability. We are doing that right now in all of these businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes on the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just talk for -- about Gulfstream for 2 seconds. One is can you give us a sense what's left in terms of the challenges for the 650 cert and then also just talk a little bit about the service business, you did talk about all the expansion. How -- what kind of growth rate are you seeing?
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, okay. Howard, thanks. The 650 certification, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're getting very close to completion of the flight test activity. That'll conclude here very shortly. Once that occurs, then it becomes a matter of putting it all together, my word, not probably the proper word, administratively, if you will, in laying all that out and then getting with -- working with the FAA to get yourself to an agreed-upon time to execute the type certification. We're on track for that. I have no indication that we're not. So I'm getting excited about it actually. I try to throttle myself back, but that's on track. Once that happens and as that happens, okay, once the flying's done, then we'll -- they'll start training the crews for the aircraft to be delivered, et cetera, as we had talked before. And you'll see then entry into service within a matter, I should think, of weeks after the type certification occurs. So we're marching down that time line very aggressively and visibly, I would add. They're doing lots of flying right now, but we're almost done with it. The service business, Howard, I mentioned, I think, the service business was up like up 5% for the first half. I would expect it to probably stay kind of flat for the rest of the year. I don't -- and why do I say that? Because the lack of activity, for example, that we're seeing in Europe right now, I don't see that getting any better for the rest of the year. It's causing us to have to reshape our European business somewhat at Jet, as I mentioned earlier. So the service business is doing fine, but I don't expect it to outperform the first half in the second half. I'd love to be pleasantly surprised on that, but I just don't see it right now. And we measure that in lots of different ways, not the least of which is looking at what visibility our service centers have on their order books and it's still pretty close aboard. Not a lot of long-term appointments for discretionary repair and upgrade. So it's still a very strong business for us, but I don't see much more than flat for the rest of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with Lazard Capital.
Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Can you help us understand order flow a bit better? Where do bids submitted, pending approval, currently stand? And can you give us the mix of recompetes versus new opportunities in that number? And then finally, as we look out over, say, the next 6 months, what does -- what do you plan to submit to -- on new contracts?
Jay L. Johnson: Wow. Let me just put it in macro terms, Mike. I mean in IS&T space, as you know, we have thousands of contracts in the year. I would characterize the order activity as being quite healthy actually, okay? We don't quantify it inside of that because it's just, like I've said, they're just flat; too many moving parts. But we anticipate the funnel is still there and the funnel will need to get serviced. So as I said earlier, the order activity in IS&T, we anticipate to be fairly respectful and ending the year at probably 1x, which it needs to do. And you know in that short cycle business, they got to turn inside themselves at least inside the year. So that part is good. Where we're seeing the challenge right now, as I've mentioned, is in the actual converting that into -- converting orders into sales and execution, and we're working very hard with our customers to get the appropriated funds obligated and to execute the 2012 plan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: You sort of just touched on this, but what I was going to ask you is what level of bookings you need across the 3 segments, understanding that some are longer-cycle than others, in order to meet your targeted guidance for the year? I'm thinking about the third quarter, specifically, since no one knows what the fourth quarter is going to do.
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, I mean, I think I expect Combats' bookings to improve. I think I may have mentioned that. Marine, not much, but remember -- remember, Marine is very lumpy. So we'll get Marine orders in big slugs. We'll work them off, which we're doing right now and then we'll get another big slug. I'm not worried in the least about Marine. And then IS&T, as I said, it's got to turn itself inside the year and we anticipate, based on the funnel we see out there, still being close to 1:1 for the year. So I think -- I hope that's responsive.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Well, Jay, one other thing. Do I detect a shift towards service in the Marine business with the recent acquisitions? Is that a strategic thing that you're doing given the long-term outlook on production?
Jay L. Johnson: I wouldn't say it's a switch to service. I would say that we're adding service to a very robust platform portfolio, and the repair business is a wonderful thing to be in for the United States Navy with its global fleet. So we're trying to enhance our repair opportunities and I'd love to keep -- we will keep doing that, but it's not at the expense of because we've got 3 shipyards that are going to be very busy for as far as I can see.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: This is actually Jon Raviv in for Jason. Just a quick question on cash deployment priorities, looking at dividends, buybacks, M&A -- where your priorities are given the current environment? And then just on the M&A question, where your M&A priorities might be? I know we've seen some defense acquisitions of late, perhaps there's some commercial opportunities on the horizon as well?
Jay L. Johnson: Okay. Thanks, Jon. We always pouch our capital deployment in terms of balance and I'm certainly not about to change that. I would caveat it, however, by suggesting that as you look at the rest of this year and you look at, the term we're using, the fogbank, is now ahead of us in terms of the sequester: how it's going to be dealt with, what the CR is really going to translate to, how all that gets dealt with here in the next 6 months. I would suggest that capital deployment would be dealt with very cautiously and that's certainly what our intent is here. I would rather keep it in my quiver right now and that's kind of where we are. Now there aren't a lot of M&A opportunities of large and I don't see any of really large scale out there. There are some and we've -- I just talked about one of them, that we took advantage of, in IPWireless. I just talked about another one in Earl Industries. Those good opportunities to add to our portfolio will still be out there and we would take advantage of such opportunities. But I think the operative word, certainly into next year in capital deployment, is caution and maintain your balance and keep the quiver as full as you can.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Jay, I thought maybe I'd ask a bigger picture question on the Marine side. When you look at the ops tempo, clearly the Navy is small for the missions being asked of it. You've got the Navy stretched thin over Central Command and at the same time being asked to cover significant areas in the Pacific Command. The pivot to the Pacific has been long in the making, but I don't think anyone foresaw how much the Navy would be tasked over Central Command. So it's clear that the Navy budget faces real strain in terms of the needs for more ships. And I'm just wondering if you could give us color on what kind of discussions you're having with your Navy as they wrangle with solving this problem. Is there kind of examination into, basically, maybe buying more lower-cost surface combatants? Or the Virginia-class sub was supposed to be a low-cost sub; could they downsize yet again and develop less costly subs? Can you maybe add some vibrancy to kind of how you're working with the customer kind of wrestle with this?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I mean we've had this discussion before in the context of even before the Pacific pivot was announced. I mean, we are global Navy. Over 90% of the world's commerce moves by sea, by volume, as I recall. I don't think that will change, certainly not anytime soon. And with that as a reality, United States Navy must maintain a robust force structure. That robust force structure must include lots of ships. And as I've said before, presence really does make a difference, and so you have to be there particularly when you're dealing now with the realities in the Pacific where the tyranny of distance causes you to be unable to be in multiple places at the same time very easily. So all that bodes well when you're a Navy shipbuilder for your future opportunities. As to your comment about the Virginia-class, the Virginia-class submarine in that program, itself, is what I would call as close to a model program as the Department of Defense has and we're very proud of that and we bring those boats in at the price tag that was -- I think, the public price tag is like $2 billion a boat. In point of fact, we delivered the Mississippi $60 million under budget and a year early, so we know how to build Virginia-class submarines. There is no substitute for the Virginia-class submarine in my humble opinion, and I don't think the Navy would argue with that. We need them in number, that's why Block IV will become a reality and there'll probably be a Block V after that. So the customer is looking at costs all the time on things like SSBN(X), but we still must have a fleet of major platforms. LCS will have its role, but we're still going to be making -- manufacturing lots of, in Jay Johnson's humble opinion and I think the Navy would agree, lots of major surface combatants, aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines and the auxiliaries that will be needed to service them around the globe. That will not change.
Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And you said you're not the least worried about Marine. Does that mean that the second sub and the second destroyer in FY '13 will be executable? And lastly, if you don't mind me squishing this in, Jay, there's some smaller ships that are clearly struggling and I just wondered if you could touch on whether that creates some M&A opportunities for you?
Jay L. Johnson: On the last, I'm not particularly looking at any of that. On the smaller ship side, I think I know what you're talking about, but we've got plenty of work right now with the platforms we have. And the second submarine and the second DDG, I think the Navy and everyone is working very hard to keep that rate as the reality because it's the most cost-efficient and smartest move for everybody. So we're confident there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So a kind of 2-point question on profitability at Gulfstream. The first part is you did 16.1% close to the first quarter, even though forfeitures were down and you had the problems at Jet. How come? And secondly, you had said that G650 should have above-average margins. Given that volume will be up in the second half, presumably with the G650s in your guidance, how come the margins aren't better in the second half?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, they are better than I guided to earlier, Cai, but I would say I'm being a little bit conservative here. I've got a product mix at Gulfstream. We delivered, I think, like 4 of the mid-cabins in the first half so we're going to be delivering more of the mid-cabins in the second half and -- so I'm at the mid-15s right now. And as is usually the case, I'm hopeful they'll outperform that. But we've got Jet, you touched on it, but if you compare it to the first half -- first quarter, I'm sorry, we've got, I think, we were down like 60 basis points. But a lot of that had to do with timing from Jet absorption expenses related to their resizing effort, which I touched on but didn't really elaborate. They are on track to be about break-even for the year, but they've got a lot -- they had a lot to take out here in the first half.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: But isn't that even if Jet is going to do better in the second half, you have more 650s, you basically -- your volume on the mid-sized given the price differential just isn't that big. It still looks like, on paper, the margins in the second half should be better than the 16.1%. Are we missing something here?
Jay L. Johnson: No, I don't think so. I'm probably hedging. As I said, I'm being a little conservative with it, Cai, partly because of the restructuring and the market that Jet's seeing in Europe right now and partly because I'm just -- I'm hedging myself a little bit on product support which, as I'd mentioned on an earlier question, is I expect to be flat and that remains to be seen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: In Combat Systems, just if I look at that you did about $4 billion in revenues in the first half to get to $8.5 billion for the year, it would certainly imply a stronger second half. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that pickup in that second half? And then just secondly, unrelated, was OT&E recently talked about the HMS Manpack as not being -- performing as well and I just wanted to know if you could comment on that.
Jay L. Johnson: Actually, I think I know on the last what you're referring to, Sam, and that basically is some old news that's already been taken care of. So the Manpack is -- they're quite happy with the Manpack right now. As to the first, it's really -- hit me with it again?
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: You did $4 billion in revenues in the first half, you're saying $8.5 billion for the year, so it's got to pick up.
Jay L. Johnson: Yes. Some of that, I think, will have to do with ELS, which we expect to be stronger in the second half than in the first half in Land Systems international programs, which as I'd said, it had some program delay but we expect more pickup in the second half. ELS' and -- I mean Combat Systems has been, historically, rather back-weighted to the year. I don't expect that to change, but I'm quite confident in our $8.5 billion number.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a couple of clarifications. Jay, could you be specific on the number of flight hours or test points or whatever that have been achieved on the 650 versus what's necessary? And then on the IS&T side, looking for margin pickup in the second half, but I thought I heard you say that the services side of the business, which was what you believe is going to provide the incremental revenue pickup and so that would suggest an adverse mix shift. What am I missing there?
Jay L. Johnson: To your last, of the $500 million in incremental that we need to get to where we -- I'm guiding in the second half, 2/3 to 3/4 of that comes from IT service. Your point is well taken. The tactical communications piece of that, though, is about 20% to 25% of that. And assuming that happens, which we have every indication that it will, that will give us the margin lift that I talked about. As to your first, I'm not going to get test point-specific. Let's just say that we're down to a very reasonable number of flights that remain and we're on track for the third quarter certification. There's no mystery in any of that, that I'm saying. And quite honestly, I can't remember the precise figure, but I've been tracking it virtually every day or every other day and we're marching down the flight test point, burndown chart quite nicely and I'm very confident that we're going to be wrapping it up very soon here.
Amy Gilliland: And thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3748. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the first quarter 2012 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. And you have the floor, ma'am.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter Conference Call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson: Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by noting that today mark the 60th anniversary of General Dynamics' listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Generations of employees have helped to make this great corporation successful over the past 6 decades. Our exceptional people continues to drive GD through their innovation, operational excellence and commitment to continuous improvement. I am proud to be their CEO. Before speaking to the quarter, I want to address the current defense budget environment. On the fourth quarter call in January, I mentioned the potential for complications to 2012 budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, the likelihood of another continuing resolution and the threat of sequestration. These potential complications have indeed revealed themselves to us in the first quarter, particularly in our shorter cycle IS&T business, as looming budget cuts negatively influenced Department of Defense and federal government acquisition execution. While it's still early in the year, we're in no position to know the full effect of these complications on the year. The anxiety over these issues will almost certainly escalate, as we move into the summer months and the election campaigns roll into high gear. Washingtonians are seemingly unified in their belief that sequestration will not happen as currently legislated, although no one can explain how avoiding the severe cut will be achieved. In recent weeks, Pentagon leadership has reiterated that no plans are in place to deal with sequestration, while stating that they expect further guidance from the Office of Management and Budget this summer on how to begin planning. This will certainly spawn increased rhetoric and speculation, as details emerge on how cuts will be administered, making it even more difficult to overcome our customers' reticence to commit resource.  In the midst of this uncertainty or the "fog bank," as I often refer to it, the FY '13 budget has begun the Congressional approval process. While there are some puts and takes across our portfolio, as you would expect, there were no real surprises for General Dynamics in this budget request, and we were generally pleased with the support for our shipbuilding and technical communications program. As expected, the future disposition of Stryker and Abrams programs will be the subject of ongoing discussions with all stakeholders. As we look to the rest of the year and much of our portfolio, contracts are in hand, and we're on our way to achieving our expectations. In other parts of our portfolio, particularly our short cycle IS&T products and services, risks remain. We are doing everything we can to jumpstart the expenditure of previously appropriated funds. And with this as prologue, let's talk about the quarter. Revenues in the first quarter were $7.6 billion, down from the first quarter of last year due to lower defense revenues, particularly in IS&T. Operating earnings were $860 million, leading to company-wide operating margins of 11.3%. Net earnings were $564 million, which resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 on a fully diluted basis.  Revenues, earnings and operating margins were negatively impacted by $67 million of non-cash, other period adjustments recorded at Combat Systems' European subsidiary European Land Systems, ELS. In total, the corrections at ELS reduce the company's fully diluted earnings per share by $0.13 in the quarter. These adjustments were not a function of program performance, but rather were related to shortcomings in our accounting department at ELS.  Following a thorough analysis, we determined that certain transactions were not properly reflected in prior periods. The corrections have been made and the underlying causes remedied. Free cash flow after capital expenditures, totaled $324 million or 57% of earnings from continuous -- continuing operations, better than last year's first quarter. In terms of capital deployment, we repurchased 1.4 million of our shares in the first quarter and acquired an FBO at Houston Hobby Airport, the fifth most active U.S. business aviation airport to further expand Aerospace's service network. We also invested $90 million into our businesses to include the continuation of a $500 million, 7-year program to ensure Gulfstream's Savannah campus is sized to accommodate an expanding global customer base. And in March, our board increased the dividend to 8.5%, the 15th increase in as many years. First quarter orders were stronger than the first quarter of 2011 due to healthy activity in our Marine Systems group. At the end of the quarter, backlog totaled $55.2 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract totaled $82.2 billion.  Now I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business groups, starting with the defense businesses. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems revenues were $1.9 billion, down modestly from last year's first quarter and in line with our plan for the year. Revenues in the quarter reflected increased international vehicle volume, including growth on 2 significant LAV and tank-export programs, improved axle sales and the addition of Force Protection. This upside helped mitigate lower U.S. and European vehicle and ammunition volume, as well as the sale of the detection systems business, which was completed in the second quarter of last year. Combat Systems delivered $203 million of operating earnings in the first quarter. The group's operating margins were 10.6%. Without the previously discussed accounting adjustment at ELS, the group's margins would've been approximately 350 basis points higher, reflecting good execution across our 3 U.S. Combat businesses.  And we continue to work on improving ELS' profitability by divesting non-core assets, reducing the number of operating location, moving its headquarters and better integrating the 4 entities that comprise the business. These actions position ELS to compete more effectively in the broader global market, particularly, given the present challenges in their more difficult European home market. Combat Systems' backlog declined from year end to $10.7 billion. Despite this decline, there were several notable awards in the first quarter, including contracts to produce Stryker mine rollers and Foxhound vehicles, and to continue to demilitarized a variety of munitions. We anticipate improved order activity at Combat Systems as the year progresses, including over $1.5 billion in Stryker and Abrams awards and several production awards for an FMS tank upgrade program. Last week, in fact, we received an award for the 46 Abrams step upgrades funded in the FY '12 budget. Additional award opportunities that may happen this year but are not integral to our 2012 results include selection to compete in the next phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, JLTV, competition; additional Stryker Double-V Hull vehicles; a new LAV and tank export programs for an array of international customers, including nearly 200 tanks for Morocco. In March, our general tactical vehicles team delivered our proposal for the JLTV competition for the Army. This combat-proven, off-the-shelf vehicle, EAGLE by name, has already been deployed successfully in Afghanistan by German forces. It incorporates the unparalleled protection of Double-V Hull technology and is a reliable, operationally cost-effective, low-risk offering, which aligns with the Army Secretary's priorities for faster, smarter, cheaper and better solutions. For the year, I expect -- I continue to expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales. Full year operating margins will be pressured due to the impact of the adjustment made this quarter and will likely be closer to the high 13% range. Next, I'll discuss Marine Systems. Marine Systems revenues were $1.6 billion, down 4% from last year due to less T-AKE and Littoral Combat Ship volume, as these construction programs near completion, and lower Virginia class sales as we transition from the second to the third block of submarines. Increased ship repair revenues, following the October 2011 acquisition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, helped to mitigate the decline in construction programs. Operating earnings were $185 million, up nearly 11% compared to a year ago. Marine Systems' 11.5% operating margins were a 150 basis point improvement from last year's first quarter. The favorable earnings and margins are due to improved performance on the T-AKE and Mobile Landing Platform, MLP, auxiliary program. The 13th T-AKE, Medgar Evers, successfully completed sea trials last month and was just delivered to the customer yesterday. The 14th and final T-AKE, Cesar Chavez, will launch in May and deliver before year end. The first MLP, Montford Point, now 51% complete, remains on schedule and budget to deliver in May 2013. This ship is demonstrating the value of completing ship design before starting construction. We began construction of the second MLP, John Glenn, last week, and received a contract to build the third ship, Lewis B. Puller, into the quarter.  In addition to these NASSCO programs, we continue to see the group focus on cost efficiency, overhead management and risk reduction in our other 2 shipyards. At Electric Boat, Mississippi, the ninth Virginia-class submarine, recently completed alpha, and bravo sea trials and is due to be delivered to the customer nearly one year ahead of schedule and under contract costs.  AT BIW, the first Zumwalt-class destroyer, DDG 1000, is over 60% complete, while the second ship recently named USS Lyndon B. Johnson, is 30% complete, and fabrication of the third ship has just begun. We remain focused on ensuring construction success and are working closely with the Navy and other major suppliers on ship integration efforts. The Marine group's backlog totaled $18 billion at the end of the quarter. Our shipyards added several key orders to their workload in the quarter, including an additional DDG 51 and the third MLP. The Navy's updated 30-year shipbuilding plan provides several opportunities to enhance the group's backlog over the next few years. This revised plan includes a multiyear procurement for 9 DDG 51s between 2013 and 2017, and a block buy of 9 Virginia-class submarines known as Block IV between 2014 and 2018. We expect the Navy to award these contracts next year.  As part of the new shipbuilding outlook, we will also continue to work on several development programs, including the Ohio ballistic missile submarine replacement effort and a new program called the Virginia payload module, which will provide additional payload capacity for Block V Virginia-class submarines. The Navy's outlook also includes an additional MLP ship, the fourth in the class, planned for FY '14.  Marine Systems remains on track to achieve my guidance of revenues slightly below 2011. Also, as the T-AKE program winds down through the remainder of this year, I continue to anticipate some margin compression. However, given the group's strong first quarter performance, I anticipate margins will be closer to the high 10% range for the year. Now IS&T. The Information Systems and Technology group had a challenging first quarter, as many of the negative trends that we experienced in 2011 persisted. Group revenues were $2.4 billion in the quarter, down primarily as a result of weakness in our technical communications portfolio. Volume in our IT Service business was flat year-over-year, as the addition of several businesses in 2011, including Vangent, offset lower workload on several major IT infrastructure support projects that are concluding. There are several reasons for the continued softness in our Communications business, including further award delays in our shorter-cycle products, especially encryption hardware; slower-than-anticipated ramp in programs moving from development to production, like JTRS and WIN-T; and the slower-than-anticipated transition of some legacy contracts to new awards, particularly Common Hardware Systems-4, CHS-4 program. In each case, we expect gradual improvement activity as the year progresses.  As it relates to encryption, persistent and dynamic threats to vital national networks require continued upgrades and updates to encryption equipment. Because of the mandate for regular investment in these products, we view this shortfall as largely a timing issue. On development programs, our JTRS HMS and WIN-T programs continue to demonstrate their capability in the first quarter, including deployment of our HMS Rifleman radio to Afghanistan, with the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment. In the past 6 months, WIN-T Increment 2 has made great strides through its formal milestones, including successful government production and reliability testing.  Both JTRS and WIN-T remain on track to progress through further testing and acquisition milestone decisions this year. Additionally, both programs were well funded in the FY '12 budget and received strong support, totaling nearly $2 billion in the FY '13 request. We expect to receive FY '12 funded awards for WIN-T, as well as Rifleman and Manpack radios later this year. With respect to contract transition, CHS-3 was a very successful program that exceeded its original ceiling cap value several times. We were awarded a $3.7 billion, 5-year, single-source, IDIQ contract for the CHS-4 program last summer. CHS-4 is an extremely flexible contract that purchasers from across the military and other government agencies can use to acquire the latest, ruggedized, commercial computing and communications technology. Following last summer's award, we had limited activity under the new CHS-4 contract. We are now finally beginning to receive some orders. IS&T's lower sales volume impacted earnings and margins, which were $218 million and 8.9% respectively. While both were down from last year's first quarter, the margin decline was due primarily to program mix. With the addition of Vangent in late 2011 and the continued top line pressure in our communications product portfolio, services now represent the largest component of our IS&T portfolio.  While IT service work provides an excellent return on investment, margins on these types of programs are generally lower than more product-intensive programs. The IS&T group continues to aggressively manage its cost structure to protect profitability and competitiveness through actions such as facility consolidation, workforce reduction and discretionary spending reductions. These actions could afford some operating leverage when delayed volume returns. IS&T's backlog was $9.6 billion at the end of the quarter. While order activity improved from the fourth quarter, it was not at the level of prior years. We did, however, book several awards, some of which are detailed in today's press release, which highlight our ability to capture opportunities in high-priority growth areas, including cybersecurity, cloud computing, health IT and IT mission services.  When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contract totaled $32 billion. For the reasons I just outlined, I anticipate award activity to improve as the year progresses, and then point-of-fact, we've already seen some positive indications in April.  For instance, earlier this month, we received a 4-year, $173 million Rescue 21 sustainment award. Also, last week, our tactical communications business received a 10-year IDIQ contract with the FAA worth potentially $400 million to deliver radios to enhance air traffic controller communications. And we recently received long-lead funding to provide security systems for buildings and infrastructures in Saudi Arabia. This is the beginning of a multiphase several hundred million dollar project. Awards are starting to break free, albeit slowly. In light of IS&T's slow start to the year, we now expect group sales to be approximately 5% lower in 2011, with margins in the mid-9% range. Revenues and earnings will be back half weighted. Now let's talk about Aerospace. Aerospace growth continued in the first quarter, with revenues of $1.6 billion, up 20% from last year's first quarter. This healthy top line growth was driven by more large cabin deliveries, including G650s and continued growth in aircraft service demand.  The additional large cabin deliveries also grew double digit improvement in the group's operating earnings, which were $271 million. Margins were 16.7%, down modestly when compared with the prior-year period because of lower liquidated damages and higher R&D expense. Earnings and margins were up sequentially due to improved performance at jet aviation. Gulfstream orders were good this quarter, representing demand for products across our portfolio. Customer interest remains strongest at the upper end of our portfolio, although we are seeing improved interest in the G280 as entry into service approaches and the mid-cabin market slowly improves. Orders from our North American customers comprise the largest percent of orders in the quarter, a noteworthy development preferred by corporations taking steps to recapitalize their fleet. We also continue to see strong demand from Asia-Pacific customers. First quarter gross new the aircraft book-to-bill was 0.7x on a dollar-denominated basis. Orders continue to significantly outpace default. Default activity was driven by a few additional G650 cancellations, which filled in to 2012 from customers who were billed for milestone payments following the aircraft's provisional-type certification late last year. Consistent with my fourth quarter remarks, the G650 defaults are in line with our expectations. And even in light of G650 deliveries and defaults over the past 2 quarters, we still have close to 200 in backlog.  At quarter end, the group's backlog was approximately $17 billion, down from, year-end, due in part to the G650 default activity I just mentioned, but still very robust by any measure. Because new orders for the G650 currently have a 5-year entry into service date, we don't expect orders to match planned deliveries in the near term.  Continued demand for our G450 and 550 products keeps us in our target 18- to 24-month window from new aircraft orders to delivery for these aircraft. The decline in Aerospace as backlog in the quarter also reflected the cancellation of a wide-body Jet Aviation completion project, following the death of a customer. Aircraft flight utilization trended up in the first quarter, with a particularly strong March finish. This positive trend enabled service revenues at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation to post gains over last year's first and last quarters. We continue to make investments in our service network to better correlate our footprint with growth in the installed global base.  For instance, Gulfstream recently announced the planned opening of Gulfstream Beijing, a joint venture, which enables Gulfstream to be the first business jet manufacturer to offer factory service in China. This facility complements an authorized Gulfstream repair center in Hong Kong, as well as Jet Aviation's newly upgraded MRO and FBO locations in Singapore. Similarly, Gulfstream and Flight Safety International have teamed to open a new flight simulator in Hong Kong. This center will train Asian operators on G450 and G550 aircraft, enabling them to complete training much closer to home. In addition to the stronger service volume I just discussed, Jet Aviation's completions business made positive progress in the quarter. We delivered 1 of the 3 narrow-body/wide-body aircraft that had experienced significant cost growth. We will deliver the second shortly -- actually, almost any day now, and we expect to have the third aircraft delivered by the end of the second quarter. The new jet leadership team remains focused on capturing narrow-body/wide-body completions opportunities, while simultaneously optimizing the business to better align with today's market conditions. Gulfstream's G650 and G280 development programs continue to make progress in their respective flight test programs in the first quarter and remain on track for type certification in the midyear, perhaps moving into the third quarter. We're in the final stages of testing with the FAA, so the exact date of type certifications will really be determined by their schedule. Rest assured, however, that we are getting close, and both aircraft continue to perform extremely well. Entry into service for these aircraft, particularly the G650, continues to drive my Aerospace guidance of approximately 15% top line growth. Given the strong performance in the first quarter, particularly at Gulfstream, Aerospace margins will likely be somewhat higher than my original guidance, probably in the mid-15% range for the year. In summary, given the environment I detailed and our current outlook, I am reiterating my full year guidance of $7.10 to $7.20. With that said, in light of the company's first quarter results, we'll most likely come in at the lower end of this guidance range. And as I detailed at the group level, the composition of the earnings has changed slightly. I would remind you that this guidance does not anticipate the result of capital deployment. As we look to the rest of the year, there remains a great deal of uncertainty in defense. However, our businesses are focused on execution and remain agile and well positioned to adapt to the dynamic defense environment confronting our industry. Meanwhile, our Aerospace group is well situated to continue a steady growth trajectory, fueled by demand for our large-cabin, in-service Gulfstream aircraft, the entry into service of our new G650 and G280 aircraft and increased global demand for the group's aircraft permits. Our diverse portfolio, healthy balance sheet and cash outlook afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business. With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial [indiscernible]. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. Before we start the question-and-answer period, I'd like to cover a few additional financial items, including some more detailed discussion of the $67 million adjustment in the Combat Systems segment.  And let me start there. This adjustment is the result of human error, which we've caught and have now corrected. We have accounting policies and procedures and systems in place throughout all our operations. Unfortunately, sometimes, individuals fail to follow them. I should mention that this was limited to and isolated in our European-Land-Systems-based -- Switzerland-based vehicle business.  Beginning in late 2010 and spread over every quarter in the interim, there were 2 central accounting issues. I want to remind everyone that they were accounting issues, not performance issues. First, revenue was recognized in excess of the contract value on 3 contracts due to foreign exchange costs that were improperly accounted for. And second, revenue was recognized on costs that were not properly recorded to cost of sales, but rather, remained in CIP. We have evaluated this adjustment, the quantitative and the qualitative impact of the adjustment on the current quarter, prior quarters and the full year earnings, and we've determined that it was not material. Moving on to net interest expense, net interest expense for the quarter was $39 million versus $34 million in 2011. For 2012 we expect net interest expense to be at the lower end of our range of $155 million to $160 million. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $900 million of net debt, down just over $100 million from year-end. The effective tax rate was 31.3% for the quarter compared with 31% in the first quarter of 2011. For the full year, the effective tax rate should approximate 32%, rising slightly over 2011 due primarily to the lack of an extension of the R&D tax credit. We plan to contribute $500 million to our pension plans in 2012. Funding will be the greatest in the second and third quarter, the first installment of approximately $100 million having been made in early April.  Finally, now that we've seen one quarter of run rate, we are lowering our forecast of corporate expense, which is shown in the segment detail of operating earnings in Exhibit B to the press release. We're revising that forecast to $70 million down from the $80 million we were forecasting at the beginning of the year.  Amy, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the questions and answers.
Amy Gilliland: [Operator Instructions] Jeff, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Jay, could you talk a little bit more about the sensitivity at IS&T? You've adjusted the guidance given the pressure. How do we think about a CR in the fourth quarter might -- how that might further affect things?
Jay L. Johnson: First of all, as I think we've probably talked before, we see the likelihood of a CR very high. So I think that will be the reality we deal with later in the year. But I will say that we've had a slow start as I described in IS&T, but we are starting to see award activity. My guidance assumes the resumption of my terms here, what I would call more normal activity as the rest of the year progresses. We have indications that, that is still going to be the case. The encryption business, as I described, will have to move here at a certain time, because you just can't put that off, but so long. So that was the basis of my timing statement. The communications programs, specifically WIN-T and JTRS, are in the test at NIE next month, and we expect LRIP-II decisions that are in the plan. We have every indication that's going to happen here, May, June timeframe or slightly thereafter. That's 6,000 Riflemen radios and more Manpacks. So we feel pretty confident that, that's going to happen. So what am I saying? I'm saying then that we see enough daylight ahead of us, even in front of the fog bank, and feel that a CR at the end of the year, based on what we have already appropriated, if you will, in 2012, will put us in pretty good shape just to go through that fog bank with the guidance I've just delivered. Okay?
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes. Would you characterize IS&T as having greater uncertainty than Combat at this point?
Jay L. Johnson: I think, yes, of course. And why do I say that? Because, again, it's the shorter-cycle business, and it's been the one that's been, shall we say, most exposed here. Through the CRs -- look at it this way. I don't want to over-dramatize here and say perfect storm scenario, but in a way, you could almost make that case when you say, "Look, we've had 2 CRs in the last year. We're likely to have another one. We've got the reality of award delays." We got -- because of that or part of that is protracted acquisition cycles. You got this fog bank as sequestration out there. And then we've got programs that were mature and very successful concluding Pentagon [ph] renovation, Rescue 21, CHS-3, the Walter Reed here in DC. So that being replaced by other programs -- these are good programs, but they are slow to pick up the ramp, if you will, and the margins will probably be a little challenge relative to the old mature programs until they get rolling. But still in all, that scenario, I can see it through what appropriated in 2012 in a way that makes us confident that the guidance is very achievable. Could it change? Sure it could change, but right now, the best vision we have says, we think we can get there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Actually, I wanted to put a finer point on the other question. I guess, as we -- can you just help us reconcile a little bit, Jay, sort of what seems to be conflicting puts and takes between you're talking about budget cuts affecting execution and anxiety escalating? And then revenues and margins in IS&T being back half-weighted and award activity improving. And I'd also love if you could touch on top of that. Talk to us about what's happening with award fees in general. Where are you today versus a year ago and versus maybe 2 or 3 years ago?
Jay L. Johnson: Okay. Let see, Heidi. We do believe that it's going to be back-half-weighted. I mean, one of the reasons I took the guidance down was because of what we're seeing so far. So if you take my guidance down 5% as I just did, and then you look at the rest of the year as I just described to Rob, is there uncertainty out there? You bet you. But again, if the appropriated funds are obligated, we believe this is a good piece of guidance for IS&T. As we've discussed and will continue to discuss, I'm sure as the year goes on, the fog bank becomes more real the closer we get to it. But again, I was -- to be very honest with you, 3 weeks ago, I was more concerned about it, it being 2012 execution, than I am today just because we are starting to see some award activity that was frankly absent in the first part in the majority of the first quarter. So am I enthused about that? I'm gratified by it, and I'm hopeful for it, but you know, the check's in the mail to a certain extent here until we see, as I mentioned before, more sustained "normal activity" going forward. And that ties back to the obligation of appropriated fund. So it's going to be a very, I think, dynamic is probably a fair way to say it, year, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T business. But I'm giving you the straightest we have right now on the view that we see out forward. The award fees in general, and that I don't see frankly -- I guess, the comment I would make would be the competition you see, in particularly, the IT Service business is as intense or more intense than it's ever been. So there, I think, Heidi, is where you're seeing a lot of that. That accounted for -- the IT Service business is probably about 1/3 of the decline in my forecast. The Tac Communications business was probably 50% to 60% of that decline, and part of that decline in IT service frankly is biz lost, my term, in this hypercompetitive environment which gets to your point on these.
Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just one last follow-up. Jay, when we -- you sort of -- I guess, when you talk about the 5% guidance down and obviously, we wonder whether that's sufficient, can we at least have the understanding that you've baked enough cushion in the other divisions that could have potential offset to what we're seeing or potential worsening in IS&T?
Jay L. Johnson: Yes. I think -- I mean, my answer to that, Heidi, is yes. And if you look at -- I see opportunity, and I've used a little of guidance in Aerospace and Marine, in both. And I'm very -- at this point, I feel good, confident about Combat Systems, in terms of absorbing the impact of what happened with the accounting issue at ELS. But the 3 U.S. businesses were essentially on and on. So I think yes. That's a long yes to your answer.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Jay, back on IS&T, you talked about service being a bigger portion now and that impacting the margins. Can you give us a break out of service versus product? And given the bigger portion at service now, or normalized margins when IS&T kind of get back to somewhat normal here? Or are normal margin's going to be more in the 9% range on a go-forward basis?
Jay L. Johnson: 9% to 10% is probably -- what I have in my head right now is a fair answer. To your earlier point. Were talking, right? Given the, shall we say, pullback or delay in the tactical communication and the product business in IS&T, the service side of it takes 40%, 45%. It becomes -- you're approaching half of the IS&T book is in the Service business with great business, as I said in my remarks, great return on the investment, but at a lower margin.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then in Gulfstream, you commented that North America was pretty strong. Can you give us a break out how much North America, actually -- how much of total orders were North America in the quarter?
Jay L. Johnson: For the quarter, it's about 60%, so -- and I've talked about that some in the past, but I think it's really good for everybody to see that coming back. And even better, when you match that to the other statement I made, which is if not North America replacing Rest of World, Rest of World is still doing great, but North America is also coming back now, which is, I say, a good sign for everybody.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Jay, on the Aerospace division, I was wondering if you could comment on the pricing situation in the quarter, whether you've seen any improvement there, and how it differed from model to model and even region to region.
Jay L. Johnson: Pricing did you say?
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Yes.
Jay L. Johnson: Okay. Right now, the pricing is very strong on the large cabin. That's a consistent statement. That hasn't changed. And frankly, I don't see it changing, both 450 and 550 for us. The mid-cabin market as we see it, based on the activity levels and listening and talking to the other OEMs, I think for us, it's improving, but still a bit challenged, I guess, is a fair way to say it. We're seeing 280 activity. The 150 activity for us was slow in the early part of the quarter, and it picked up in the latter part of the quarter. So that's a good thing. I hope that's responsive to your question.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Yes, and just a follow-up. With the strong pricing and the continued strength in the backlog for the 450 and the 550, what point, do you think, can we anticipate production heading higher?
Jay L. Johnson: We've got a pretty good chance of having it about right now, because as I mentioned, we're still in kind of a 18- to 24-month sweet spot backlog. And as long as that's the case, I think we've got the production rate about right.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: It's been Finbar Sheehy for Doug. As you mentioned earlier, in Washington, there seems to be a broad agreement that sequestration would be bad, but no clear path to avoid it. At what point during the year do you need to have contingency plans in place, just in case they actually don't manage to avoid it? And how do you think about what sort of actions you could take, especially given the sequestration, if it ever happens, could be quite short lived or not?
Jay L. Johnson: Yes. That's a tough one to give a crisp answer to, because we don't know the frame of the template that we're going to be dealing with. Suffice it to say that as I've said previously here, I think the challenge for us, the responsibility, really, for all of us, is to stay committed to executing the appropriations that have been laid forth for the year. And if we can continue to do that, there's reasonable news in entering as I say, that fog-bank-called sequestration out there. How it manifests itself, nobody knows. How do you prepare for that? It's really tough. But what you do is you maintain your agility, you keep running your business, you control your costs as best you can, you stay focused on execution, and you don't overcommit yourself with capital, I think, in that kind of an environment. And that's about the best protection I believe you could give yourself coming into something that is unknown as what we're seeing right now.
Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And just a quick follow-up on a specific aspect. You mentioned about restructuring in European Land Systems. Can you give us a sense for the scope and scale of that? Sort of how far you are along in it? And whether the restructuring costs might be a drag on margins this year?
Jay L. Johnson: No, to your latter. And it's been a work in progress quite honestly for quite some time. Example would be the movement which we executed late last year of the ELS headquarters from Vienna to Madrid. So we're attending to that, basically all around. And it's continuous work. And it'll continue to occur as we move forward, but it's not impacting our margins right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Jay, I guess, I want to take a different tack, which is -- that if I look at your guidance and I see Marine margins up, Aerospace up, even with the volume cut at IS&T, you mentioned interest expense in the lower end and corporate expense in the lower end, it would seem as though, actually, you should be higher, not at the low-end. And so I'm just trying -- are you forecasting a contingency of a continuing resolution? Is it haircutting, that IS&T could be worse? Where are you hedging? Because it would seem like it actually should point higher, not lower.
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, I appreciate that, Sam. And I would just tell you that I think particularly, as it applies in IS&T, we like what we're seeing. We just haven't seen enough of it. That's a fair way to say it. I mean, it's early in the year. There's starting to be movement. We're starting to obligate the appropriated funds. We're starting to see that. That's a good thing. If that continues, okay. Then maybe I can feel differently. But right now, in terms of where within the $7.10 to $7.20 band we are, but right now to be honest with you, I haven't seen enough of that goodness, and I've got the $0.13 dividend. That just was the reality here in the first quarter. That's what puts me at the low-end. I'd love to outperform that. And I'm hopeful that we can. But I'm just not ready to write that check yet.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just secondly, it sounded like when you mentioned the 650 and 280 type certification that it perhaps it flips into third quarter. What's happened there? It just seems like it's moved a little bit to the right.
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, it has -- I mean, to be fair. And it's frankly just a matter of scheduling and executing a very detailed test regimen with our partners in the FAA. I mean, that's pure and simple. And may we do it better than that, yes. But right now, with the testing, we see that they want to have -- I'm just -- I'm hedging it a little bit. I'm not worried about it. It's just a matter of -- and it's not just a matter of getting type certification, okay. You get type certification, then you have to get the simulators certified, then you have to get the crews for the airplanes that are entering into service type rated, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a fairly complex set of realities you have to be dealt with, starting, of course, with getting the type certification. So if it happens, second quarter or third quarter, to me, I'm happy either way it's coming, the airplanes are performing beautifully and there's great enthusiasm for them out there. So I'm not hedging it, because I see a problem. I'm just hedging it because of the reality of the testing and the pacing of that testing. This isn't the only thing the FAA has to do either. So I'm just being sensitive to that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC: Jay, on that score with the G650, have they done the test that caused the problem, that caused the crash last year?
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, we've done those, yes. I mean, we've done most, all of the, as I would characterize it, company testing. But the protocols are such that you do it, and then you analyze it, and then the FAA works with you, and you do it again. So it's a series of sequential events that have to occur here. And so that's I think the answer that you were looking for.
George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC: And then a quick follow-up, were forfeitures at Aero around $20 million? And is the jet completion business still have a loss this quarter?
Jay L. Johnson: Sorry, I missed the first part of that, George.
George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC: Were the forfeitures at Aero about $20 million from the G650 cancellations?
Jay L. Johnson: I don't quantify that. But I've been very consistent here in saying that we expected a number of G650 cancellations once the PPC call was made. And we got basically what we expected. So Gulfstream piece of that is in line. The reason I brought up the other for the Aerospace and backlog is because it was a big jet that fell out of the backlog, because of, frankly, the death of a customer.
George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC: And did the completions business have a loss yet in the first quarter?
Jay L. Johnson: No, completions business is doing -- is on plan. And I'll take the opportunity to say that you didn't ask this, but I mentioned, we've delivered 1 of the 3 aircraft. I would tell you that the -- just to reaffirm to everybody and to my folks at Jet that the feedback I'm getting first hand on the quality of those airplanes, and what they've done is spectacular.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a quick follow-up on Jet Aviation. You talked about the deliveries of some of the challenged planes going forward. Can you just talk a little bit more in detail around the timing and the margin recovery of Jet? Just kind of update us on where we are? And when you think that Jet will reach normalized margin rates? And what more do you need to get that done?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, as I said, Jason, I think before that what I expect out of Jet this year is essentially breakeven, and then we ramp from there. And right now, I feel pretty good about that. In fact, I feel very good about that. The real challenge in the completions business, quite honestly, will no longer be our ability to manage the throughput. It's to fill the skyline. So what am I saying? I'm saying if the business is out there, we've got the protocols and processes in place now to really nail that business, okay, which is good news for everybody. I'm really proud of what they're doing now. And the challenge will be if the customer demand is there. And we're working on that very seriously, as you would expect.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a quick one on Jet, on the wide-body cancellation. Was there any P&L impact as a result of that in the quarter? Or was it just the backlog?
Jay L. Johnson: Mostly backlog. Maybe just a smidgen on the quarter. To be honest with you, I can't -- I don't even have the number in my head, but it's not material. It's mostly just backlog, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just didn't know if there was a big forfeiture, I mean, in one time. And secondly, I know there's a lot of discussion on The Hill about Abrams and the facility and the budgeting there. I wondered if you might provide us an update with how you see that playing out, and what risk there may be in the guidance, should you not see the sort of plus up, you guys were trying to get similar to last year.
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, I mean, I think I'm not worried about the 2012 piece. We've got work to do as I mentioned before in 2013. But I would say that it's pretty consistent here, in terms of the concern -- that Abrams has generated with JSMC Lima regarding the whole issue of defense industrial base going forward. And we've had, as recently as yesterday I think, I read in the clips this morning, 170 members of Congress signed a letter to Secretary Panetta expressing their concern on this issue, which says, frankly, this defense industrial base, as we go into this full fog bank and deal with the new realities that everybody's challenged with, the defense industrial base is elemental to that discussion. So from our standpoint, of course, we think that totally appropriate and must be part of the calculus, and we're very encouraged by it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: You had some pretty significant management announcements over the last several weeks. And Jay, I'm wondering if you might comment on a, on how you and Phebe will be working together in her new role. How do you envision this role? And any update you can provide, given this announcement, on succession plans for the company? And also any comments you might have on the new head of your Shipholding business?
Jay L. Johnson: You're not trying to push me out the door, are you, Joe?
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Not at all. Just want to get the updates, pretty big announcement.
Jay L. Johnson: Now, listen, first of all, just to refresh, next week, the 2nd of May, to be precise, Phebe Novakovic does become the President and COO, working directly for me. As you would expect, that's the start of a very disciplined succession rhythm here, if you will. She and I are spending a lot of time together as you would hope. And I'm very anxious to get started here, frankly. We spent a lot of time with my direct reports now, executive vice presidents, senior vice presidents with Phebe. And so the transition is beginning, and we're very encouraged by all of that, so -- and we'll continue to work very closely together as you would hope. Likewise, Phoebe is in the process as we speak of turning over Marine Systems group to John Casey, who is currently President of Electric Boat. And then John will be turning over EB to Kevin Poitras, as you probably know. In every one of those moves, we're very well served. And John's going to do a superb job as EVP, and Kevin will do likewise as the President of Electric Boat. So it reaffirms, frankly, the bench strength of General Dynamics and how seriously we take the succession business. And we feel very comfortable with all of that, Joe.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, Are there any comments you can make on just how you and Phebe will be working together day-to-day on running the company? Are you going to maintain a focus on different areas than her? Or are you going to make joint decisions? Or how do we think about how you're going to divide the executive responsibilities?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, one of the things she'll be doing, first-order, of course, as you would expect, is spending a lot of time with the other executive vice presidents, if you will, and the businesses, getting herself, shall we say, refamiliarized, because she's fairly been total focused in the Marine group as was her task -- to get her now snapped in, if you will, resnapped in to the other 3 business groups. So as first order business that would be elemental to what she's doing. And she and I will work very closely throughout all of that as will the rest of the leadership team. So this is teamwork underlying.
Amy Gilliland: And Jeff, I think we have time for one more question this morning.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So you had very strong large biz jet deliveries in the first quarter. Could you comment, what are you looking for, for the year? Is there upside, given that's very strong first quarter, unless it was bloated by huge forfeitures, which you're seeming suggesting isn't the case, isn't 15.5% a conservative number?
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, I always give you conservative numbers, Cai. But, I mean, it's a pretty reasonable number from what I see today. Is there some upside to it? I certainly hope so and I think there probably is. But I think that's reasonable today, quite honestly.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I mean, you haven't told us. I mean, are you looking for more large biz jet deliveries? You said that completions were on plan, but you didn't say whether it was in -- jet was in the black. You say you expect it to only breakeven for the year, so a little hard to kind of see the rollout from here.
Jay L. Johnson: I think the completions -- the production rate, as I think I always say, can be -- it's unchanged today. Can it be tweaked a little bit? Yes, as we go through the year. Will it be? It's too early to tell. That's a fair answer.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3748. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Maria, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now turn the presentation over to Ms. Amy Gilliland, the [ph]Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson: Thank you, Amy. Welcome back, and good morning.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you.
Jay L. Johnson: General Dynamics' fourth quarter was marked by our best cash quarter ever and strong operating performance at Gulfstream and across our defense businesses. Charges taken by Jet Aviation's completion business blemished an otherwise solid quarter and year.  Fourth quarter sales and operating earnings were the largest of the year at Gulfstream and at each of our defense businesses. Company sales totaled nearly $9.2 billion and up 6% from last year's fourth quarter, driven by Gulfstream G650 deliveries. Operating earnings were $950 million for the quarter, while net earnings from continuing operations were $603 million or $1.68 per fully diluted share. For the full year, sales were $32.7 billion, a modest increase over 2010. Operating earnings totaled $3.8 billion, with Combat Systems and IS&T both topping $1 billion of EBIT.  Net earnings from continuing operations were $2.6 billion or $6.94 per fully diluted share, an increase of 2% over last year's EPS result. Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter. For the year, free cash totaled $2.8 billion or 109% of earnings from continuing operations. Let me address the 2 Jet Aviation charges first, one related to contract losses and the other an impairment of an intangible asset. These charges reflect 2 issues that I have previously highlighted, namely, lingering performance challenges on several narrow-body, wide-body aircraft, and the significant decline in other OEM business jet completions work.  The contract losses taken this quarter, which depressed group margins by over 400 basis points, resulted primarily from cost growth caused by increased labor hours and late penalties on 3 wide-body and narrow-body aircraft. These legacy aircraft are the most complex custom completions project ever undertaken at Jet Aviation. Once we've delivered these aircraft, our Jet team will focus on completing the next series of aircraft, which are already benefiting from new management and operating processes. As a result of trends experienced in the completions business, we conducted a fourth quarter review of long-lived access assets at Jet Aviation and recorded an intangible impairment charge of $111 million. This impairment, which reflects an outlook with substantially fewer business jet and narrow-body, widebody completions than when we acquired Jet Aviation, negatively impacted Aerospace margins by 600 basis points in the quarter.  These charges are very disappointing, and clearly, not in keeping with General Dynamics' operational track record. The new management team is instituting necessary measures to improve Jet Aviation's completions business in 2012, including restructuring operations to lower overhead and headcount; improving the coordination between engineering and operations; and strengthening supply chain management controls.  I would point out that the other 3 quarters of Jet's business portfolio continues to perform well. Revenues at Jet's aircraft service facilities around the world were up double digits in 2012 -- 2011, excuse me, and remain well positioned with an established global footprint as emerging market business jet demand takes hold. I said many times that we acquired Jet for their global footprint. As the business jet installed base expands internationally, Jet's facilities will be ever more elemental to our Aerospace growth.  Now let me talk about the Aerospace group and more specifically, Gulfstream. Gulfstream enjoyed a banner fourth quarter, marked by strong cash generation, healthy order activity and the first 12 green G650 deliveries. These aircraft deliveries drove significant growth in the group's fourth quarter sales.  Aerospace sales, which totaled $1.9 billion, were up nearly 50% when compared to fourth quarter 2010 and up over 30% sequentially. Operating earnings were $73 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of charges taken at Jet. For the year, Aerospace sales were $6 billion, up 13%, while operating earnings were $729 million. The group's top line growth was driven by the fourth quarter G650 deliveries and improved service activity throughout the year.  Gulfstream made meaningful progress in product development in the fourth quarter, to include receiving provisional type certification from the FAA for the G650 and from Israel's Civil Aviation Administration for the G280. Both aircraft remain on track to achieve full FAA IASA certification and entry into service in the midyear. Our first 12 green G650 deliveries went smoothly, giving us further confidence in the G650's design for manufacturing processes. Business jet market indicators were positive again in the fourth quarter. Aircraft utilization remained robust, and our service centers enjoyed another good quarter. For the year, our Aerospace service business was up a combined 15%, including Gulfstream's best year ever in service volume.  Preowned inventory levels for both large- and mid-cabin aircraft continued to show gradual improvement. We took one aircraft in trade in the fourth quarter, and subsequently sold it for a small profit. We had no preowned aircraft in inventory at the end of the year. For the year, we made a modest profit on just over $75 million in sales on 5 preowned aircraft. The Gulfstream order book was healthy again in the fourth quarter and exhibited many of the trends we've seen throughout the year. Although orders were placed for each of our aircraft models this quarter, demand remained strongest for our large-cabin offerings.  Similarly, international customers continued to dominate new orders, although North America enjoyed its strongest quarter of the year, comprising nearly 45% of the order book. Notably, with this strong fourth quarter finish, Gulfstream booked the highest number of orders in 2011 since the introduction of the G650 in 2008, causing year-over-year backlog to increase to $17.9 billion. New aircraft book-to-bill this quarter was one-time on a dollar-denominated basis. Despite strong bookings, backlog decreased from the third quarter due primarily to the large number of green G650s delivered. Also, as expected, G650 defaults were higher than normal this quarter, as customer milestone payments were triggered by provisional type certification. We actually saw fewer defaults than anticipated and still have over 200 G650 aircraft in backlog. I should also highlight that we continue to maintain an 18- to 24-month backlog for our G450 and 550 aircraft. At year-end, Gulfstream's backlog consisted of 64% international customers, including 27% in Asia Pacific. The Gulfstream product support organization continued to expand in 2011 to keep pace with our international customer base, including new facilities or additions in the United Kingdom, Spain, Singapore and elsewhere.  In the fourth quarter, we also announced the opening of a product support office in Hong Kong, and the opening of an office in Beijing, which will enable us to better serve our growing Asia Pacific-based customers. Fortune 500 and other public companies comprised 34% of year-end backlog, up modestly from 2010, with individuals and private companies comprising the other 2/3. In 2012, we plan to deliver just over 100 large-cabin green aircraft, including approximately the same number of G550s and 450s as in 2011 and about 2 dozen G650s. We expect mid-sized green deliveries to be around 10 to 15 aircraft, primarily the G280. The additional G650 deliveries will drive 15% top line growth in the Aerospace group this year, and margins should be around 15%, driven by improvement at Jet Aviation.  Next, the defense side of the business. Before discussing the performance and outlook for each of our defense segments, let me comment briefly on our defense outlook. Amidst the backdrop of continued deficit focus and political divide, we are pleased to start the new year with a 2012 defense budget, as this provides some clarity to our 2012 planning process.  General Dynamics programs were well supported again in this year's budget, including $577 million for Abrams tanks, $723 million for Strykers, $1 billion for WIN-T, and $1.1 billion for JTRS, and full funding for all of our ship and submarine programs. Congressional support for the defense industrial base was solid throughout the 2012 legislative process, particularly as it relates to our tank, Stryker and shipbuilding programs. However, even with an approved 2012 defense budget, we recognize the potential complications to budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, likelihood of another continuing resolution and the looming shadow of sequestration. As we saw in 2011, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T world, budget officers and program managers are put into positions where they naturally pull back or make awards very cautiously when a continuing resolution is likely. This year, with the added threat of sequestration, the situation becomes even more unsettled. If sequestration were to occur as laid out today, it would be very bad for defense and frankly, for our country. While many believe, as do we, that it is unlikely to happen as presently described, no one knows how it will be resolved.  The DoD has already provided some FY '13 budget details, particularly as they relate to the Budget Control Act defense top line. The Secretary of Defense is scheduled to provide more detail this week, with the service chiefs to follow in the days thereafter. That should give us more insight as to how investment accounts overall, and our programs in particular, will fare.  Given our incumbency and relevance, we do not expect any significant surprises. The roles and missions study implies that ship, ISR and cyber programs will continue to be priorities in 2013 and beyond, especially as the new Pentagon strategy pivots toward Asia Pacific. Conversely, we would expect to see some uncertainty in the 2013 budget request concerning the final disposition for Stryker and Abrams funding by Congress.  Following a decade of growth, we are now in a new era where defense spending is clearly coming down. Given this backdrop and our lessons learned from the changing defense environment in 2011, my 2012 defense segment guidance is realistic. We are doing everything in our control to position our defense businesses for the declining budget headwinds, including continuous improvement initiatives, restructuring, divesting non-core businesses and headcount reductions.  These types of actions enabled us to maintain defense earnings in 2011 despite declining sales. As appropriate, we are also adding new businesses to shore up our outlook and improve our competitiveness in faster-growing market channels. We continue to feel confident about the defense portfolio relevance in this environment -- our defense portfolio relevance in this environment, excuse me. Our facilities are key parts of the defense industrial base, which must be maintained.  We have solid incumbency in the Army and Navy Force Structures, and with fewer new programs, incumbent platforms and programs capable of addressing today's dynamic threat environment will require continued production and modernization. Now let's move to Combat Systems. The Combat Systems group delivered a productive fourth quarter, marked by the acquisition of Force Protection and healthy domestic and international order activity. The Force Protection acquisition, which closed in late December, expands Combat Systems' sustainment business, tactical wheeled vehicle product portfolio and product development capabilities.  As partners in delivering thousands of Cougar-variant MRAPs to the Marine Corps, we gained an appreciation for the company's significant research and test capabilities. Our broadened development experience, together with Force Protection's proven product portfolio, better position combat systems to compete for vehicle sustainment and upgrade opportunities in new development programs globally.  In the fourth quarter, Combat Systems sales were $2.6 billion, while earnings were $388 million, both down 3% when compared to last year. This downslope was in part a function of timing, as several new engineering and development opportunities planned for the year, including the Ground Combat Vehicle moved to the right. Margins were 14.9%, also on par with the year-ago period. For the year, the group sales were $8.8 billion. This represents a modest decline in sales from last year, the result of lower U.S. vehicle volume, particularly Abrams and Stryker. International LAV upgrades in Axles for military and commercial OEMs helped to soften the U.S. vehicle decline.  Cost reduction and productivity improvements enabled Combat Systems to maintain operating earnings at $1.3 billion despite the year's decline in sales. Margins were 14.5%, modestly ahead of our expectations, as cost performance improved on several of our core vehicle programs. Combat Systems enjoyed its largest order quarter in 2 years in the fourth quarter, with sizable awards for U.S., European and FMS vehicle programs. Notable U.S. orders in the quarter included approximately $800 million for Stryker production and sustainment; and $100 million for MRAP upgrades. The group's nearly $1.4 billion in international fourth quarter awards included LAV and tank upgrades for several customers, and another tranche of DURO vehicles for the Swiss government.  The quarter's healthy order activity and the addition of Force Protection caused Combat's backlog to expand by $1 billion, a 10% increase from the third quarter. Year-end total potential contract value for Combat was $14.9 billion, including $11.4 billion in backlog and $3.5 billion of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts. While the way ahead is not entirely clear, the flexibility and operational success of our Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles are undisputed. We believe we will see additional Abrams upgrades and Stryker Double-V Hulls either through new production or upgrades of existing vehicles. The Combat Systems business will also be extremely competitive in each of the major development programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle, where we are 1 of just 2 teams selected to compete; the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle; the amphibious combat vehicle; and the armored multipurpose vehicle. In the event that these programs are impacted by budget decisions, we have a portfolio of proven vehicle solutions to offer. Combat Systems will continue to provide support and sustainment of vehicles we produce. We have the experience and the infrastructure to expand those services to support a wider array of Army and Marine Corps vehicles. Our successful teaming relationship with the Army's Anniston depot over the last 5 years differentiates General Dynamics from our competitors.  Additionally, with Force Protection now in our portfolio, we have enhanced our exposure to U.S. and international inventories by several thousand vehicles. The requirement to improve vehicle suspension, protection and power capabilities will create opportunities for us to leverage our experience and help our customers identify ways to affordably reconstitute and modernize. Our international vehicle business continues to grow. With several billion dollars of orders in backlog, we are at work on LAV and tank production and upgrade programs for a variety of foreign customers. This work helped to mitigate pressure on our U.S. vehicle business volume in 2011 and will continue to do so through 2014. Beyond our ongoing contracts, we're tracking a variety of international competitions, including the TAPV and CCV programs in Canada, and several 8x8 vehicle and tank programs in the Middle East. Our munitions and weapons systems businesses also face budget pressures over the next few years. However, adjacent and international market opportunities and continued strength in the Axle business should provide some offset.  For 2012, I expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales, reflecting declining domestic vehicle funding, somewhat offset by growth in our international vehicle programs and the addition of Force Protection. We expect operating margins in the low- to mid-14% range, consistent with 2011. Next, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group finished the year with another solid quarter. Quarterly sales totaled $1.8 billion, up 3% over 2010, while operating earnings increased 7% to $190 million. The group's 10.8% margins were 40 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2010.  Higher Ohio-class replacement volume and the addition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, stimulated top line growth, while strong T-AKE program performance drove the earnings and margin improvement. For the full year, sales were $6.6 billion, down modestly from 2010, while earnings grew 2.5% to $691 million.  The sales decline was primarily a timing issue, as several destroyer awards planned for earlier in the year slipped into the third quarter. The group's 10.4% operating margin for the year reflects the commitment to manufacturing excellence across our shipyards and improved performance on the T-AKE and MLP programs throughout 2011. Marine's year-end backlog totaled $18.5 billion. This enduring backlog includes several awards received in 2011, which position the group for success in 2012 and over the next several years, including 2 additional Zumwalt-class destroyers; DDGs 1001 and 1002; 2 DDG 51 destroyers, part of the Arleigh Burke restart program; 2 mobile landing platform MLP ships; and additional repair work enhanced in part by the NASSCO Norfolk acquisition.  In 2012, we expect to receive the RFP for the next block of Virginia-class submarines, which should include 9 boats. This contract is scheduled to be awarded in 2013. For the year ahead, I expect Marine Systems sales to be ever so slightly down, with margins in the low- to mid-10% range. The group's outlook is very stable, with a number of opportunities, including the next block of Virginia-class submarines; the SSBN replacement program; additional DDG 51s; a new program to replace the Navy's aging class of oilers; and new commercial work.  The value of our Navy's global mission was reaffirmed by the Pentagon's recent roles and missions study, which emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong military presence, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This bodes well for our shipbuilders. Moving to IS&T. IS&T finished the year with fourth quarter sales at $2.9 billion and earnings at $315 million, essentially flat from the year-ago period. Continued strength at our IT service business, bolstered by the addition of Vangent, helped to offset a decline at the group's tactical communications business. Group sales were pressured by the FY '12 continuing resolution, which exacerbated the sluggish award activity felt throughout 2011.  Margins increased 20 basis points to 10.8%. For the full year, IS&T sales were $11.2 billion, down 3% from 2010, primarily due to lower tactical communications volume. This lower volume was the result of several program cancellations: FCS brigade modernization; IWIN integrated wireless network; and JTRS AMF, just to name 3; and award delays, particularly in shorter-cycle encryption, mobile and ruggedized computing products. Two of our largest sole-source tactical awards in 2011, WIN-T Increment 2 and CHS-4, were delayed by approximately 6 months. Despite significant market pressures, the group's IT service business continued to deliver organic growth in 2011. This growth, which helped to mitigate the group's sales decline, was primarily due to several large IT infrastructure support projects and success in capturing new business opportunities. IS&T operating earnings were $1.2 billion in 2011, as margins expanded 20 basis points to 10.7%. Consistent with the group's historical trend, IS&T order activity was lighter in the fourth quarter than the previous 3. For the year, IS&T book to bill was 0.92x, a good result in a year which included 7 months of continuing resolutions. Year-end total potential contract value, which includes backlog, IDIQ contracts and unexercised options, totaled $32 billion, an increase of 28% from 2010. This healthy opportunity set positions IS&T well for 2012, particularly given the reasonably strong support the group's products received in the 2012 defense budget. For instance, following successful 2011 customer testing, we anticipate receiving FY '12 funded awards for the next low-rate production increment of WIN-T and the first tranche of full-rate orders for our Rifleman Radios. Also, despite the market environment, IS&T's opportunity pipeline is larger than ever, as our products and services portfolio remains well aligned with customer spending priorities focused on cyber security; enhanced ISR; battlefield communications; and streamlined, more cost-effective IT infrastructure.  IS&T sales will likely be flat in 2012. As suggested earlier in my remarks, this guidance anticipates that the shadow of sequestration and the potential for another fourth quarter continuing resolution continue to prolong and delay awards, effectively pushing sales to the right even more than what we saw in 2011. Margins should be in the high 9% range, driven by a higher percentage of IT services work, continued slowdown in product volume and the competitive market environment. The 2012 segment guidance I provided this morning implies total earnings per share from continuing operations in a range between $7.10 and $7.20. This guidance is operational. It does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment. In terms of capital deployment, we maintained our balanced approach in 2011, and I expect that to persist this year.  Last year, we deployed $1.4 billion to repurchase 20 million of our shares. Through both share repurchases and dividends, we returned 77% of free cash to shareholders in 2011. We also spent $1.6 billion to acquire 6 businesses that enhanced our Combat, Marine and IS&T portfolios. Our strong cash performance in 2011 and excellent cash outlook for this year afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business. In closing, while no one today can say with certainty what defense spending will look like in 2013 and beyond, we feel our businesses are as well positioned as any. Marines products are at the heart of the Pentagon's Asia Pacific focus, while IS&T, cyber, ISR and intelligence mission-support capabilities remain well aligned with customer requirements.  Combat's vehicle programs will be challenged. However, strong international sales will help to defray budget headwinds. And we continue to believe that enhancements and upgrades to our vehicle programs offer an attractive lower risk alternative to our customers as they recapitalize the force following a decade of war.  Outside of defense, our Aerospace group will serve as the company's primary growth engine over the next several years, as G650 deliveries ramp and the international sales increase. Clearly, General Dynamics' diverse portfolio remains a distinguishing asset. With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd: Thank you, Jay, and good morning. I'd like to cover a few additional financial items before the question-and-answer period.  First, net interest expense was $38 million for the quarter and $141 million for the full year. These amounts were in line with our expectations. For 2012, we expect net interest expense between $155 million and $160 million, reflecting the full year impact of the $1.5 billion of fixed rate notes we issued in 2011. As you may recall, in July, we issued $1.5 billion just prior to the maturity of notes in the amount of $750 million.  Corporate expense was $77 million for 2011, and we expect corporate expense to approximate $80 million again in 2012. The effective tax rate was 33% -- excuse me, 33.8% for the quarter and 31.4% for the full year. And the fourth quarter was higher than the prior quarters and higher than we anticipated due to less European income than we had expected.  That, of course, was a result of the performance in our Swiss-based completions business. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, rising slightly over the 2011 rate, but due in large measure to the current lack of an extension of the R&D tax credit in the provisions of the tax code.  Finally, cash contributions to our pension plans for 2012 are expected to be approximately $500 million, occurring primarily in the second half of the year.  Amy, that concludes my remarks.
Amy Gilliland: Thanks, Hugh. I'd like to highlight that a summary of the guidance provided this morning is now posted on our website as supporting materials in the webcast link.  [Operator Instructions]
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Jay, I'm hoping you can give us a little color under the surface in some of the guidance that you provided, particularly in Combat and IS&T. And just to start with Combat, the underlying organic decline there, about 10%, can you give us a little bit more clarity on programs that constitute that shortfall or that decline? And as you look out further, are those programs stabilizing? Or are they continuing to retreat and then you'd backfill them with the international growth elsewhere?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, as I mentioned, I mean, we're seeing U.S. decline that we offset with the international, as you just said and I said in my remarks. But I mean, it's a combination of Stryker and Abrams, primarily. And if you look out past 2013, you don't see a lot. But if you looked at a year ago, what we had in 2012, you didn't see a lot either, and we ended up being very well supported. So this is a constant work in progress between us, the customer and the Congress, and I would anticipate that to continue. So there will be some U.S. vehicle decline. We see that quite clearly. But don't forget, those programs are both elemental to the United States Army, even as they reshape themselves. So we'll use the international sales to help offset that, but we'll still do a great deal of business in both those domestic programs. And now we've got Force Protection in there to help us on both the product and sustainment piece for the vehicle business.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Was it roughly split, the $1 billion decline, organically between Stryker and Abrams? Or is it favoring more one over the other?
Jay L. Johnson: No, I think it was more Stryker, actually.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Jay, just to follow up on that, a lot of moving pieces. Could you maybe give us a number, organically how much you see the entire defense side of the business down in 2012?
Jay L. Johnson: Probably 1% or 2% would be my -- off the top of my head, offset by the Aerospace growth.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And as a quick follow-up, you mentioned North America for Gulfstream's strongest quarter in a while there. What do you think's driving that at this point? And do you think what you're seeing is sustainable?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, first of all, the Gulfstream order book is healthy across the board. I mean, we're very pleased, particularly, as I mentioned, in the large-cabin. That's a consistent message I've been delivering, but it's backed up by the backlog in the order book. We see very healthy order activity, particularly in the large-cabin offerings. I would say the United -- North American market returning is a good sign. It's still outpaced by the international space. But we're very encouraged to see the North American market activity picking up.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Jay, on the G650, could you update us on how things are going here? You got the provisional cert. You delivered the aircraft. You had said, I think, that the margins on the first aircraft would be in line with the sector average of around 15%. So did that actually transpire in the quarter? And then, as we look forward, how do you feel about getting the complete cert? How -- the rate ramp-up, the completions, how's all that coming along?
Jay L. Johnson: Okay. Joe, first of all, I'm very pleased with the 650 program. We're very excited about it. The aircraft is performing beautifully, and the sales book is still very active, even with over 200 in the backlog. So that's all good. We are on track, as I mentioned in my remarks, and I think the way I said -- the words I used were "in the midyear." We're still looking at about late second quarter, thereabouts. It's paced, quite honestly, by the working down of the test points in collaboration and with the FAA. All on track. All looking real strong right now. The airplanes, as I said, are performing beautifully. The margins were consistent with what I've been saying, Joe. They are better than the group average but not as strong, as you would expect, as the in-production large-cabin aircraft. That, too, will change, as I've said before, and it will ramp up beautifully. I'm just not-- I'm not ready to wick that up verbally yet. But everything we see in the production side, everything we see in Savannah is coming along very handsomely with the 650. So the rate ramp-up that you asked about, again, I'm going to hold to what I've said before. The production, we're going to add about 2 dozen or so green deliveries a year. Did I say -- yes. 10 to 15 a year is what I'm -- 10-15 a year green deliveries. But my complete deliveries, I'm sticking with 17, 33 and 33 for right now, with every expectation that we'll exceed that. I'm just not ready to go there yet.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And just finally the completion process, that has been a bottleneck in the past on new aircraft types. How are things going? And how do you feel about getting those first dozen aircraft that you've taken payment on, in terms of green deliveries, into customers' hands?
Jay L. Johnson: We feel very good about it. I think it's proceeding just very well, actually. We're anxious to get them to the customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Perlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit about the, marine segment? I would've thought that, I guess, with the delay on the DDG 1000, as that starts to come in that you'd actually have a worse mix. And it sounds like if I just look at this fourth quarter, as well as your outlook into next year, it would seem like you're not seeing any sort of an adverse margin mix in Marine.
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I mean, we're clearly still benefiting from the superb performance on the T-AKE program. And that keeps it up. But honestly, even as that matures out and completes at the end of this year, I do not expect to see a drastic margin reduction at all. And I've been very consistent in that. This is a 9%- to 10%-margin business with these 3 superb shipyards. And I say that publicly and then charge the shipyard presidents to beat it.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: But it's 9% to 10%, but you're guiding to above 10%. So should I say that, or think that's the T-AKE?
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, exactly. Yes, indeed, yes. And as I said, that will complete at the end of this year, Sam.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Jay, question on Combat. I just want to get a clarification. Can you tell us what the percentage of international sales was for Combat in 2011 and what that looks like in 2012?
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, Heidi. It's about low 30s in 2011, and I'd see it going up probably a couple of percent or so in 2012, and therefore continuing that kind of a ramp out for the next -- well, with clarity through 2014 to 2015.
Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And on the Jet Aviation, at your September conference you talked about the issues at Basel and highlighted Jet as a turnaround story in the second half of '12. Can you give us, sort of fold in the charges we're seeing today, relative to those comments? What changed and prompted this charge? Did things get worse?
Jay L. Johnson: I think the way I would-- the best way for me to say it, Heidi -- and I've described it, as you point out, kind of throughout the year. But when we put the new management team in place, okay, just after the midyear and Dan Claire and his team settled in, we brought in some other subject-matter experts from across the businesses here at General Dynamics and particularly at Gulfstream, with the sightline to get clarity and definition, if you will -- more granularity on what we were feeling and seeing. They did exactly that. And as we brought ourselves through the second half of the year, we came to a point in the fourth quarter where the magnitude became very clearly defined for us. And therefore, we realized the operating earning impact, which then triggers an impairment review of the long-lived assets. And so you have it, $78 million of one, $111 million of the other. And I also mentioned in my remarks that most of this tied to the legacy aircraft, and the 3 legacy aircraft in particular; and somewhat to the OEM business mix change, if you will, from the other OEMs, which has impacted us. Those 3 legacy aircraft will be delivered here within -- one of them within a matter of a couple of, few weeks and the others -- by the midyear, I should think they'll all be gone, delivered to customers, with very happy customers in terms of the quality of the work. But I would also say that the charges that were taken capture the costs that we have incurred thus far, and those we project for the completion of those 3 legacy aircraft. I think it's important to put that out there. So we've got the right leadership in place; the management team is firmly in control; the processes that were causing us problem with throughput have been, in large measure, really well defined, clarified. And we're running smoothly with a workforce that is pulling together in the ways that they need to. So I think we're finding ourselves in 2012 in a place of much better improvement at Jet completions, and we're anxious to see that reality unfold throughout the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I guess, 2 issues at Aerospace. First, if you can update us on the status of the G280, when that should be certified. And secondly, if you could give us the number of the dollars you had of forfeiture gains in the final quarter and some color on what you look for, for 2012.
Jay L. Johnson: Okay, Cai. The 280 cert timeline, I mentioned in my remarks, we got CAI, the Israeli certification provisional -- full cert, sorry. And so now we're working with the FAA to get provisional type certification here in the U.S. That's ongoing right now and proceeding. There's no issues here. It's just marching down the timeline. I believe, based on that, some of the software issues we'd talked about before in terms of what you need to get final certification, type certification, I would expect that to be second quarter -- midyear, as I said, entry into service. But as far as the aircraft itself, the aircraft itself is performing very well. And there is great customer interest. So I think that captures most of the 280. Let me think. Yes, that's probably enough on the 280. But we're on track for certain delivery by the midyear. The dollar forfeiture, the forfeitures, the LD is really a function of getting liquidated damages from the defaults that we experienced, which were higher than they would normally be. We knew that would probably be the case. It was the case, yet it was less than we expected, which sounds like I'm talking around a circle. But at any rate, we got substantially fewer than that in the forecast for 2012. And I think that's probably enough to say right there.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Can you give us a number?
Jay L. Johnson: No, I won't give you the number. But let's just say it was probably at least half of the entire year's amount in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just wanted to follow up, I think it was on David's question from earlier. You mentioned you're seeing some activity pick up a little bit more in North America. Are you seeing any of that in the mid-sized aircraft? I mean, what's -- If you could give some commentary on what you're seeing in the mid-sized aircraft, because that's clearly been a softer spot, right?
Jay L. Johnson: Yes. Honestly, Ron, it's still a soft spot. I think that's a fair way to say it. We are seeing activity, as I've said, I think, in the last several quarters in the mid-cabin. We've got activity in the 280, but it's still a very -- there's a lot of inventory out there still to absorb is probably a fair way to say it. So it's clearly still a very bifurcated market with, I would say, very strong activity in the large-cabin and modest to -- but active at a lower level, activity in the mid-cabin.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, not big of a [ph]follow-on to the large-cabin, because it was very active in the large-cabin. I think at one point you guys said that maybe full production on the 650 would be like 40 a year. Have you questioned that to maybe go higher, to maybe 50 a year or 60 a year? I mean, is that -- are those kind of program assumptions being investigated?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, let's just say with 200 in the backlog in the purpose-built facility that you've seen and the way these airplanes are coming together and the excitement that surrounds all of that, we're always looking at opportunities to increase production as rapidly as we can smartly do it. And that's really the operative, and that's why you won't have me getting very aggressive on the number -- as aggressive as perhaps you would like or the airplane deserves. But in time, we'll be there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Jay, Hugh and Amy. I wondered if you might talk briefly to aircraft development. I mean, the company has always had a focus on a kind of regular cadence of product updates and introductions. And with the 650 and the 280 entering into service later this year, you're working on some stuff. What should we think be thinking about when we hear about new product introductions? What kind of impacts should those have on, or are they having in, your plan on the 2012 margin outlook within Aerospace?
Jay L. Johnson: I don't think that, that's -- the R&D investments, as I've -- we've said for years around here, is a constant investment and whether the top line is going up or down. We've been through that over the past few years. I would say that the R&D investment this year was higher than kind of normal for us, a full 3.4%, I think something like that. But we target 2% to 2.5% and then deviate from that as circumstance and development requirements dictate. But we're -- suffice it to say, we're in product development all the time. And you know the cycle of our airplanes, nominally a 15-year cycle. So we're either looking to enhance, upgrade or perhaps replace airplanes in due course. The 650, as you well know, isn't replacing anything. It's defining its own spot at the top of the market. The 280's coming in for the 200. That transition's going well, and the rest of it will be done in due course. But we're very pleased with the product line we have right now, and by the order activity that I described earlier. I would say, so is the customer.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So just to follow up to that briefly. Presumably, with the growth in the 650, the R&D investment would be declining as a percentage of sales, but is it declining in absolute dollar terms?
Jay L. Johnson: No. No, it's not.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Jay, I just wondered if we can have a comment from you on cash deployment and whether your thinking has evolved on whether it might be more effective to increase your dividend as a proportion of the cash payout versus buybacks or acquisitions.
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I mean, as you've heard me say many times, we do believe in a balanced capital deployment philosophy here. But specifically to your point, Rob, on the dividend, we've been very proud to increase our dividend for the last 14 years. We gave it a 12% increase last year. We deal with that and have that on the agenda for our meeting, our board meeting on the first week of March. And rest assured, we will have a very thorough discussion of that, and we'll see where the board goes. But I would anticipate dividend activity to come out of that. Beyond that, I'd certainly -- it'd be inappropriate for me to comment.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And maybe just as a follow-up to that, with regard to other cash deployment and acquisitions. How do you see the M&A market as it stands today, particularly with regard to pricing in the defense area?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I think -- I mean, I think there will be opportunities to acquire defense properties at good value, going forward. I'm not sure we are there right now. But as this market tightens, I believe that there'll be defense space opportunities. And having a lot of cash in your rucksack, as we do, gives us the opportunity to take advantage of some of that, as we did with Force Protection, whereby we got a good strategic asset at a very fair price.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Jay, I guess just a follow-up to the acquisition question. I guess the backdrop that you painted regarding defense and the cautiousness and the uncertainty regarding sequestration, how do you really approach having any kind of comfort level regarding M&A on the defense side?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I think -- again, I mean, you have to look at your criteria for acquisition and be very disciplined in how you analyze, assess and actually then act on the potential acquisition. Does it enhance your portfolio? Does it give you a fast current? Does it give you a return on your investment? And that will be perhaps more challenging as this environment tightens, or perhaps it will become even more clear that this is an obvious go or a no-go. So I think, look, it comes down to the discipline by which you execute these acquisitions. And we have a very good internal process for it. We risk-adjust everything we do, based on the type of business it is. So I feel like we've got the rigor we need to fairly assess what's out there and make good judgments on whether it makes sense to acquire or not. But having said all of that, I'll go back to where I was a minute ago, that I believe there will be acquisition opportunities going forward in the defense space -- if for nothing else, just as a result of the tightening of the defense market.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Yes. And Jay, just as a follow-up to that, how do you weigh that against the -- maybe commercial manufacturing opportunities, just given your history and exposure to commercial markets with Gulfstream?
Jay L. Johnson: We wouldn't restrict our scan pattern to one or the other. We look at them all.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a clarification on the G650, can you remind us how many planes you could produce on an annualized basis with your current installed capacity?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I don't think -- there have been numbers out there. They haven't come from us. But let's just say that the 650 production will be gauged by the purpose-built facility in which it's being constructed and our ability to put airplanes through there -- which, if you look at what we're doing now versus when we started, it was good when we started. It's really good now. It's only going to get better. So once we get the supply chain flow, the vendor flow, which is coming nicely, you're going to see very, very strong production levels at G650. But as I said earlier today, I'm not ready to give you numbers outside of what I've already committed to.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up question on the 650 and just the competitive environment that's out there today. If a customer, a new customer, were to approach you today, when could you deliver the plane to them? And if it's in the same timeframe of when they could go and get a plane from a competitor, doesn't there seem to be a pretty strong incentive for you to speed up the production rate so that you can get those planes to the customers sooner and perhaps create that as a point of differentiation from a competitive perspective?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, Jason, the way I look at it is if you got 200 airplanes in the backlog, you want to get them to the customers as soon as you can do it. But when you're dealing with the premier brand and the premier aircraft that's going to be out there very shortly, you want to make sure it's done correctly and that the customer has complete satisfaction when the product is received. Therefore, you don't want to over-accelerate yourself -- as I say, "overdrive your headlights." We're not overdriving our headlights. The production is very, very measured and very solid, and we'll wick it up when it makes sense to do so. And when we hit steady-state production in the supply chain, everything's feathered in and flowing beautifully, then we'll wick up the production. But right now, the answer to your question is you'd get an airplane in 2017. That's how big that backlog is. And we'll be producing more every year as we go forward and -- until we hit a steady-state backlog. But we're very bullish on the 650 and so is our customer base, on a global scale.
Operator: At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Amy Gilliland for closing remarks.
Amy Gilliland: Thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3748. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. All parties may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Gina, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Nicole Shelton, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Nicole Shelton: Thank you, Gina, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter Conference Call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered another solid operating performance in the third quarter, with sales of $7.9 billion and operating earnings of $998 million. Company margins improved 60 basis points from last year's third quarter and 70 basis points from last quarter to 12.7%. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.83 on a fully-diluted basis, $0.13 better than last year's third quarter.  Third quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $15 million. This result was largely a timing reality caused by working capital growth and inventory at Gulfstream, associated with preparations for initial G650 green deliveries. We expect significant G650 cash payments in the fourth quarter in conjunction with the plane certification which will substantively reverse this trend.  In our Defense businesses, I expect them to deliver their largest cash quarter of the year in the fourth quarter as we progress toward our annual goal of a 1:1 conversion. In terms of capital deployment, we repurchased 5.8 million shares of GD common stock this quarter. Year-to-date, we spent $1.4 billion to repurchase 20 million shares. Through share repurchases and dividends, we have returned over 200% of year-to-date free cash flow to shareholders. In addition to share repurchase and dividend payments in the quarter, we also deployed capital to pay down $750 million in notes that came due in July and to further enhance our IS&T product portfolio through several accretive acquisitions totaling $1.1 billion, which I will describe in more detail later in my remarks. All together, these actions clearly reflect our balanced approach to capital deployment.  Backlog increased $1.4 billion in the third quarter to $58.5 billion, as 3 of the 4 operating groups exceeded 1:1 book to bill. At the end of the quarter, total estimated contract value, which includes backlog and the value of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts, stood at $85.8 billion, up over 9.5% from last quarter.  Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups beginning with Combat Systems. Combat Systems sales and earnings improved again when compared with both last quarter and the year-ago quarter. Sales totaled $2.14 billion, reflecting growing Foreign Military Light Armored Vehicle Sales, increased axle work and somewhat lower U.S. vehicle and engineering volume. Earnings were $319 million, resulting in a 14.9% operating margin, reflecting sound execution across the group's portfolio of mature, fixed-price production programs. In addition to good operating performance, profitability continues to be enhanced by the group's efforts to cut costs and prepare for the realities of a reduced defense budget environment.  Total backlog for Combat Systems was $10.4 billion at the end of the quarter, including $2 billion of orders received throughout the period. Notable orders in the quarter included $315 million for 115 Stryker Double-Vs and vehicle support services; $440 million for the Army's Ground Combat Vehicle development program; $200 million for MRAP upgrade; and $195 million for Canadian, U.S. and nonstandard ammunition programs.  International orders included $44 million to procure long-lead materials for 102 FMS tank upgrades and $50 million for FMS LAV training and field service support.  We expect good award activity again in the fourth quarter, particularly from our international customers. We just announced the award to upgrade 550 Canadian LAV vehicles, a contract valued at $1 billion. Other key foreign orders should include funding to upgrade 60 FMS tanks, 73 FMS LAVs and another 125 Egyptian tank kits. Domestically, we've just finalized an order for another 177 Stryker Double-V hull vehicles and are working with the Army customer on an order for 100 Stryker nuclear, biological and chemical reconnaissance variants. We also anticipate several hundred million dollars in funding for other Stryker upgrades and logistic support services.  Looking ahead, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest, with most of the businesses contributing their largest volume of the year. For the full year, the group remains on track to deliver around $9 billion in sales at 14% margins.  Now let's talk about Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group delivered another successful quarter. Sales of $1.6 billion resulted from higher Ohio class replacement and MLP volume, offset by lower destroyer volume when compared with the year-ago quarter. The lower destroyer volume is really a timing issue as we received several new destroyer awards late in the third quarter that will drive incremental sales moving forward. Earnings totaled $173 million, up when compared with both last year and last quarter. The group's third quarter operating margin was 10.7%, driven primarily by continued strong performance on the T-AKE program.  Marine's backlog totaled $18.9 billion at the end of the third quarter, reflecting $2.1 billion in new orders, the group's largest order quarter since the Virginia Block III contract was awarded in the fourth quarter of 2008. This significant order flow resulted in a book to bill of 1.3x.  Bath Iron Works, won the 2 largest awards in the quarter, which together totaled $2.4 billion for the construction of 2 DDG 1000 Zumwalt-class destroyers and one DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. As part of the Arleigh Burke destroyer award, BIW was awarded an option for a second ship, which is funded in the Navy's FY '12 budget request. Electric Boat also received several engineering and development contracts in the quarter, including an award to continue development of the common missile compartment for the next-generation SSBN program.  Total estimated contract value, including backlog and unexercised options, was $20.9 billion, up over 7% from the end of last quarter. This represents a stable, predictable and enduring workload. In the fourth quarter, group sales will be at their highest for the year due to higher submarine and destroyer revenue, while margins will be slightly lower due to mix shift. For the full year, sales should remain near the 2010 result, and margins will be around 10%. Looking to the future, Marine Systems has an experienced workforce, a durable backlog and an excellent reputation for delivering affordable, high-quality ships and repair services.  We've reported several positive developments in our ship repair business in recent weeks, including the announcement of our intent to purchase Metro Machine, a Norfolk-based naval repair yard, and NASSCO's successful bid for LPD 22 work. Metro Machine provides General Dynamics the opportunity to extend our surface ship maintenance footprint to the East Coast. The acquisition of Metro also complements the repair work that NASSCO is already executing in San Diego and we believe will enhance our competitive positioning for future repair opportunities. The Marine group's proven ability to take cost out of this business and its dedication to continuous improvement, as evidenced in program learning curves across the portfolio, position the group for continued great service to our Navy customer.  Next, I'll address our IS&T group. IS&T sales were $2.7 billion in the third quarter. Sales continued to reflect 2 key realities: growth at our IT service business due primarily to large IT infrastructure support projects; and pressure on our tactical communications business. Year-to-date, our IT service business has grown mid single-digits and continues to succeed in capturing new business opportunities. The group's tactical communications business, on the other hand, continues to experience lower volume driven by prolonged award activity, particularly in the shorter cycle, ruggedized and mobile computing division.  The group's third quarter earnings were $310 million, up modestly both year-over-year and sequentially. Operating margins were 11.6% in the quarter, 120 basis points better than last year's third quarter and 90 basis points improved from the last quarter. This margin improvement reflects the group's ongoing reengineering and cost-cutting actions made necessary by the slowdown in the businesses' acquisition cycles.  Despite the impact of delayed award activity on group sales through the first 3 quarters, IS&T enjoyed its strongest order quarter of the year in the third quarter, causing backlog to increase by approximately $1 billion. In particular, award activity in our IT service business, which was selected for an array of IDIQ contracts and task orders, was particularly healthy again. We also received a handful of key tactical communications awards, which position the business for improved results moving forward. These included the Common Hardware Systems-4 program, with a potential value of $3.7 billion; the joint Global Broadcast Service program, with a potential value of $900 million; and the Wideband Networking Waveform Software In-Service Support program valued at $65 million. Additional details about many of these contracts are included in today's earnings press release.  IS&T's total estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog, stood at over $32 billion at quarter end. This represents almost 3x expected 2011 sales and is a 27% increase above last quarter's value.  We further enhanced our IS&T portfolio in the third quarter with a number of acquisitions, including: Fortress Technologies, a provider of secure, wireless networking equipment that fits nicely into our tactical communications portfolio; and Vangent, which complements our healthcare and federal civil IT service businesses and significantly expands our opportunity pipeline. With Vangent onboard, we now have a health IT business with over $800 million in annual sales and a customer footprint spanning the Centers for Disease Control, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, Military Health System, Veterans Affairs and commercial health services. Given this critical mass and diverse customer exposure and experience, we will compete effectively as a Tier I health IT provider.  On the fed civ side, we plan to leverage our existing customer relationships to export Vangent's proven services to other agencies. Vangent will be nicely accretive in 2012 and offers IS&T growth opportunities, as health and federal civilian customers inevitably seek to automate processes and gain smarter IT solutions.  Fourth quarter sales will be the group's largest yet this year, as the tactical communications business begins to realize revenues associated with several of the delayed awards added to backlog in the third quarter, and we add Vangent's volume to the fold. Margins will be in the mid-10% range. For the full year, I expect group sales to be down 2% to 3% from last year, a reduction from my previous guidance, due primarily to the year-to-date pressure on our tactical communications business top line as previously discussed. Margins for the year will be in the mid-10% range.  Next, I'll move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group's third quarter was marked by continued emerging market customer interest and improved aircraft service volume. Sales and earnings improved from both last year's third quarter and from last quarter. Group sales were $1.4 billion, driven by more aircraft deliveries, both green and completions, and higher services volume when compared with last quarter, while earnings were $217 million. Margins were 15.4%, up modestly from last quarter.  Emerging market demand drove Gulfstream's order book again in the quarter, with Asia Pacific representing nearly 50% of the order book. This includes a 20-unit order from Minsheng, the Chinese financial leasing company of Minsheng Bank, for the Memorandum of Understanding we signed earlier this year. In addition to emerging market demand, we continued to see improvement in our North American markets, including the gradual return of Fortune 500 customers.  On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book to bill was 1.5x, causing backlog to increase by over $300 million to $18.6 billion. While third quarter orders spanned our product line, the large-cabin business continues to dominate. With that said, we've been pleased to see demand for mid-cabin aircraft gaining traction, particularly as it relates to our new G280 offering.  In terms of preowned aircraft, modestly declining inventory levels continued to help foster a healthier business jet marketplace. Gulfstream took no preowned in trade this quarter and sold 2 aircraft at breakeven. At the end of the quarter, we had no preowned aircraft in inventory.  Gulfstream's installed fleet has now surpassed 2008 flying hour levels, a reality that helped our service facilities enjoy another record volume quarter. Year-to-date, Gulfstream's service business is up nearly 19%. In part, this double-digit growth reflects Gulfstream's #1 ranking in worldwide product support. In the quarter, Gulfstream product support was voted #1 for the ninth consecutive year in the annual Aviation International News product support survey. Similarly, Gulfstream received first-in-class product support recognition in the yearly professional pilot survey.  Our improved service network is particularly timely as we prepare to deliver our new G650 and G280 products to customers around the world. Both of these aircraft made significant strides toward entry-into-service this quarter. The G650, which had -- has amassed over 2,000 flight hours at the end of the third quarter, and I think today is just under 2,200, is performing well in flight testing and remains on track to receive provisional type certification in the fourth quarter. We expect to deliver 10 to 12 green aircraft before year end, with entry-into-service on track for second quarter 2012.  We're also extremely pleased by the performance of the G280, and recently announced that it will exceed the capabilities originally stated at the program's public launch. Following extensive flight testing, the G280 has demonstrated a 200-nautical-mile increase in range to 3,600 nautical miles and a shorter balanced field length, providing this aircraft unsurpassed flexibility for a business jet of its size. We now anticipate Israeli type certification by year end, with FAA type certification and entry-into-service to follow in the first part of 2012.  Jet Aviation's aircraft service-related revenues continue to grow in the third quarter. Volume is up nearly 16% year-to-date, driven by demand for Jet's MRO and FBO services. Regarding completions at Jet, the new management team is in the process of restructuring and rightsizing that business. Decreased OEM volume and several challenging widebody completions continue to impact operating performance. In the quarter, Jet Aviation announced significant overhead initiatives and personnel reductions at Basel in response to these conditions. This is an area of continuing management focus.  Looking to the fourth quarter, the Aerospace group expects provisional G650 type certification in the next several weeks, which will enable the group's sales, earnings and cash flow to reflect delivery of green G650s. Planned 2011 deliveries for our existing large-cabin and mid-cabin aircraft are also on track at 80 and 15 to 20, respectively. For the full year, I expect Aerospace group's sales to be up approximately 13% and operating margins to be around 15%. As we look to next year, Aerospace is well-positioned for growth, given our robust large-cabin backlog, planned new product deliveries and improving service volume. In summary, General Dynamics is positioned for a very productive fourth quarter. Given our year-to-date performance, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be at the high end of my prior $7.15 to $7.20 guidance. As we plan for 2012, the defense market is shrouded by the uncertainty of the continuing resolution and the activities of the congressional super committee. While we continue to have no special insight as to what the super committee will determine between now and Thanksgiving or what will happen to defense budgets beyond 2012, we are encouraged by the dialogue that the Secretary of Defense is leading regarding the national security and economic impact of a potential defense budget sequester for our nation. It is clear that defense spending will be part of addressing our nation's economic problems. However, the manner and degree to which cuts are made will dictate how they impact our industry.  In our planning estimates, defense spending will decline at a moderate pace in the coming years. However, persistent global threats, election year politics, defense industrial base consequences and outlays from existing budgets must mitigate significant declines. Additionally, GD's mature, diverse portfolio and our solid defense incumbency, particularly with our Army and Navy customers, position us well. We can leverage our incumbency, innovation and experience to either bid as prime contractors for new development programs or provide customers with steady and dependable proven solutions. Amidst this uncertainty, we are focused on managing the downward pressure by shaping what we can control. This includes continuous improvement, restructuring, headcount reductions and various other cost-cutting initiatives essential to driving profitability as the top line becomes pressured. We are divesting those businesses that are no longer core to our portfolio and identifying areas in our business where acquisitions would shore up our outlook or improve our competitiveness in faster-growing market channels.  On a positive note, our core defense programs were well funded in 2011 and would, we believe, be largely supported under a protracted continuing resolution. Additionally, our backlog already includes a good order book for next year, and we are encouraged by the congressional support our programs have received in the 2012 defense budget appropriations process.  The Aerospace segment remains a key element of our company's value proposition over the next few years. Volume associated with our new aircraft programs will drive substantive incremental sales, earnings and cash. All of us at General Dynamics are acutely aware of the realities of today's uncertain and dynamic environment on a global scale. However, we will not allow ourselves to become distracted from delivering results. We are aggressively managing our businesses for profitability, with continued emphasis on execution, earnings growth and efficient conversion of earnings to cash. Our strong balance sheet and excellent cash outlook afford us the flexibility to continue deploying capital in a balanced fashion in order to create the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd: Thank you, Jay, and good morning. I'd like to cover a few miscellaneous items before the questions and answers period. First, interest expense was $38 million for the quarter and $103 million for the full year. This puts us on track for expense of $140 million for the full year. We recorded $8 million of other operating expense, primarily associated with transaction expenses for acquisitions, and most particularly the Vangent transaction.  The effective tax rate was 30.1, 3-0 point 1 percent for the quarter and 30.6% year-to-date. We expect the full-year rate to be very close to 31%. This quarter, we recognized a $13 million after-tax charge in discontinued operations resulting from the settlement of an environmental matter associated with the former operation of the company. Finally, during the quarter, we made voluntary contribution to the pension plans of approximately $300 million, consistent with our expectations at the end of last quarter.  Nicole, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back to you.
Nicole Shelton: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Gina, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays Capital.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Jay, I wondered if you might elaborate on 2 things. The first on the 280, you said you expect Israeli type certification early next year with U.S. to follow. That sounds later -- correct me if I'm wrong, but that sounds later than what we were talking about earlier. And does that change the production profile there at all? Or is this -- you're continuing on the existing production plan, will just get certification and have more green airplanes to deliver in the future.
Jay L. Johnson: It's pretty much exactly as you said, Carter. It is a little bit later. It has to do with the sequencing of those certifications, and I don't expect that to impact the production rate. So we're working that with both -- obviously the Israeli regulators and the FAA. But we're on stream. And as I said in my remarks, we're thrilled with the airplane. It's just getting through the approvals.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And what's the real source of the change in schedule?
Jay L. Johnson: I think it has to do, honestly, with software upgrades and when they feather in, and what's required by the Israelis and the FAA. And I think just flowing all of that, to be very pragmatic about it, pushes it into next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just on Vangent, I was wondering if you could walk us through a bit more of the strategic rationale behind the price that you paid for it. And then lastly, some of the synergies that you would expect over some time.
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I talked to some of that, Jason. But I mean, basically -- first of all, we believe we paid a fair price for it. And we're very glad to have Vangent in the portfolio, most importantly. It allows us to compete as a Tier 1 healthcare IT provider, okay? That's the underlying foot stomper, okay? It puts us at scale where we really can compete. It also gives opportunity in serving the fed civ customer base, both back office and customer facing, in areas like student loans, Medicare and Medicaid. So we believe there will be lots of synergistic opportunities, as I said in my remarks, in the fast-current lanes that are becoming much more obvious in that space. So Vangent is going to be a good add for us. We've worked some -- we are working the integration right now with the existing GDIT organization, if you will, and we like the prospects we see ahead. We're very bullish on it. And as you heard me say, it comes into the financial fold here starting in this quarter, fourth quarter.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Are there any cost synergies associated with the transaction?
Jay L. Johnson: I mean, some elimination of some of the corporate expense perhaps. But it's mostly opportunity that we're after here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Jay, just when you look at, I guess, the global economic backdrop and some of the uncertainty that we've seen in -- a slowdown in China. Maybe, maybe not. What impact have you seen or not in terms of demand on the large-cabin jet?
Jay L. Johnson: To be straight up with it, Ron, I mean, we've seen no negative impact whatsoever. And as I've said before and talked in terms of the bifurcation of the business jet market, our large-cabin business is very strong and just continues with that. This is the largest order -- albeit we've got a big Minsheng number in there, but it's the largest order book number we've had since 2008. So the large-cabin business is very strong. And it's really heavily weighted to Asia Pacific, as I said in my remarks. But honestly, if you take the Minsheng order aside and look at the rest of it, it's pretty well dispersed: some North America; some Asia Pacific, as we discussed; but also Europe, South America. So it's pretty global, notwithstanding the economic realities we're talking about.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And what incremental demand have you had for 650s, say, over the last quarter or 2?
Jay L. Johnson: I think I'd characterize it just by saying there's continued interest and activity, and the backlog number continues to increase somewhat. I mean, when you got over 200 in the backlog to start with, you don't expect a lot of add to that. But by golly, it's adding, okay? So there's still great attractiveness out there for the 650 and our in-production 450s and 550s. And you've heard me talk about the backlog sweet spot, if you will, of 18 to 24 months. Hey, we're still there, okay, with the in-production large-cabin. So it's a very bullish large-cabin market right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm interested on the cost side, actually 2 aspects of this. One is, if you could talk a little bit about the cost initiatives that you're driving from corporate across the businesses and how you're pushing that, because that sounds like a big theme here, given your discussions about the defense budget outlook. But in particular, Marine, you've gotten very impressive margins there, even with product -- program transitions underway. Is this being driven heavily by cost? Or how is that -- how have you done that?
Jay L. Johnson: Cost and performance, I mean, that's the best way to say it and particularly to the last part, to your Marine question. You know, Doug, from watching our Marine group operate over the years, that they are very disciplined in managing those yards for profitability. And they do it extremely well. And that, plus the performance on the contracts that they're executing, allow those kind of margins. Now we talked about mix shift coming, and that will be a factor. But we've -- we also -- we still believe this is a business that will show us, even with the mix shift in DDG 1000 versus 51s, and MLPs versus T-AKEs, and Block III versus Block II Virginia-class submarines, we are still talking about a 9% to 10% margin business at least.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: But this sounds considerably better than, I think, you saw the business, say, 6 to 9 months ago in terms of performance. What's happening that has really improved that?
Jay L. Johnson: It's back to cost management and performance and T-AKE, as we get to the end of the T-AKE line. And it's also -- I would add that it's also their ability to outperform their CEO's somewhat conservative lay-down in the start of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So the Minsheng order, I guess some other guys who have orders from Minsheng have provisions that that's cancelable. Are there -- can you give us some color on that transaction? I mean, are there any outs for them? And secondly, is there additional potential from either Minsheng or others that you see near-term in China?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I think the answer to the last, Cai, is yes. We see the opportunity set in China continues to grow as the Aerospace business in China, the business -- Aerospace business continues to grow. And as to the first, I mean, we have very good terms and conditions on our contracts and liquidated damages clauses, et cetera. So we feel very adequately protected, if you will, with this order and frankly, the rest of them we have in our book. We're very mindful of that, particularly when you have numbers like we're talking about here. But it's spread across the product line, and they're very eager to get their airplanes. So we feel good about it right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Jay, a question on the international markets. Again, I just want to get a little bit more bead on how you would characterize the Asia-Pacific demand in commercial. Is it as strong in '11 as it was in '10? Do you see it ramping up? And then the second part is on defense. We've obviously seen a lot happening in the Middle East. And how is this affecting the pace of international competitions? And which would you highlight as the most imminent or important for you to land?
Jay L. Johnson: As to your first, Heidi, I would say yes and yes to your questions. I mean, we are seeing increased activity, pretty steady in Asia Pacific, with Minsheng being fairly typical of that. But you and I, we've talked before about things like the projections for airport growth in China, for example. And the earlier projection I saw in the year had like -- I think it was 10 airports a year that they were projecting to build. The number I'm seeing now is higher than that. I don't know if that tracks with what you see. But it could be like 15 a year. So the point of it all is that we are seeing increased activity in Asia Pacific, and as I mentioned earlier, from a large-cabin perspective, and really now starting with the 280 from the other areas of the globe as well. The defense side, international is kind of a -- let's see, how would I characterize that? The growth area right now in international is in the Middle East. I mean, that's unequivocal, okay? Our European business is mixed. Not surprising. We've talked about that before, because of the fiscal conditions in which they're operating. Their requirements are fairly well -- very well-defined, but the fiscal realities are preventing some of the contract lay-downs that they need and we would like to see executed. That gets pushed to the right. But having said that, our indigenous business, as I highlighted with Canada on the LAV contract, the production contract that just got laid down, is very good. The TAPV is proceeding right after that with -- for selection within the Canadian forces. And so there are mixed messages perhaps in some of what I'm suggesting, from Europe in particular. But the Middle East market continues to grow and continues to execute very well for us. And that's in more than one place, as you probably know. So we see that as probably key to our international book of business in the Combat Systems group, going forward. As the U.S. market flattens to declines, the indigenous European market stays flat, the ammunition market comes under some challenge in the short term just to burn off inventory that it has right now. You're going to see the growth coming out of the Middle East.
Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And just quickly on that, what percentage of Combat Systems, international, is it in '11? And what does it look like in '12?
Jay L. Johnson: The number I've got in my head is around 30%, I think, right now in '11, of international sales. And as you -- I don't have a '12 number, but the projection I looked -- out a few years, when we last -- when they last showed it to me, was in the mid- to upper 30s. So it's growing as a percentage of their book of business going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from SunTrust.
Peter J. Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Jay, on the guidance for this year, are you guys basically factoring in 0 for the share repurchases?
Jay L. Johnson: I don't really factor share repurchases in when I do guidance. If that's what you're asking me, yes. So my answer would be yes. Now having said that, we have the authority and the wherewithal to do so tactically as we always do, if the market suggests that it's time to buy back some shares. But the answer to your question is yes.
Peter J. Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And a question on margin. Fourth quarter in Combat sounds like it's going to be really, really strong from a top line perspective. It just seems like kind of 14% margin rate is really conservative. I mean, shouldn't we be thinking more like 15% or so for the quarter?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I'm pretty comfortable, I think, with what I said overall. And it has to do with timing of, shall we say sunsetting of some programs that showed themselves in the third quarter. EFV comes to mind and perhaps FCS. So that's why I'm tamping myself back down to what I'd call more normal in the fourth quarter and for the year.
Peter J. Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Understood, understood. If I could sneak one last one in, because I'm really confused in IS&T margins. If services are doing really well and products poorly and yet margins were up to 11.6%, and given the margin differential there, I mean, shouldn't we be thinking 11.5% or so as sustainable given what you're doing on this type of mix?
Jay L. Johnson: It's another one where you've got some timing here in terms of the programs that delivered, that helped us deliver. You've got cost-cutting initiatives that I discussed in my remarks and performance that helped us drive the margin. But you've also got -- in this quarter, 3Q, you've got some program -- not termination -- I'll use the term sunsetting again, like WIN-T Increment 1 that gives you a margin lift there that you probably won't represent again in the fourth quarter. So I think I'm comfortable with the margins that I've laid down.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with Lazard Capital Markets.
Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Jay, just to stay on the Combat Systems point. In your prepared remarks, you comment about the FMS LAV orders, also some pretty significant logistics work that's out there. Should we expect these orders to all book in Q4? And also, will the book at year end be enough to support flattish revenue moving into '12?
Jay L. Johnson: I'm not ready really to talk in any detail about '12. I mean, as I said in my remarks, I'm encouraged by what we've got in the order book and what's coming to the order book, even post Q3, that tees us up for 2012. But beyond that, I don't think -- I don't see a precipitous decline, as we've discussed in the past. But I'm not ready to give you any hard numbers for 2012 yet. But I do think that the order book that we've seen, we're expecting Q4 orders for more FMS tanks, for example. We expect the Egyptian Increment 11 to come to closure here -- I mean literally within days, perhaps. So these things are moving forward. We expect more Stryker consideration on the support side and/or the NBCRV that we talked about -- that I talked about in my remarks. So I think another tranche perhaps of LAV from the Middle East. So we've got a lot that's pending that we're confident will come across. It's just a question of the timing space, 4Q or into next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Access 3:42.
George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC: Jay, if you looked at IS&T, where it's down 2% or 3%, I'm assuming Vangent's $200 million in revenues. So you're looking for, without Vangent, another relatively weak quarter. Is that all due to the tactical communications area? And how much is that area actually declining by itself? It must be a pretty substantial amount.
Jay L. Johnson: Well, honestly, George, I think what you're seeing in a lot of it here is -- I would call it a combination of CRA timing and customer behavior. What does that mean? That means that what we're seeing -- and I alluded to it, or -- quite directly, I think, in my remarks, you're seeing prolonged acquisition cycles, shall we say. The time between bid and proposal, and then actually award or task order has increased 50%, 100%, 150%. I mean, for example, one of the large awards that we've received in this space, we were the only bidder and it still took over a year to bring that award forward. So that's just a timing reality that they're all dealing with in it. Particularly important, as I said in my remarks, is some of the mobile computing and ruggedized equipment: the tactical, the products and systems piece. The services piece is holding its own. I don't see, honestly -- well, let me add something else to that. I think what you're also seeing in this space, back to the customer behavior, is we've read pieces of -- well, read quotes from people I have great respect for, like the DNI, General Clapper, who speak to the IT space right now. And my take on that is that what you've got is an environment whereby the things that must be dealt with right now, okay, the high-priority stuff, either for the war or for cyber or for something that cannot be deferred, you're seeing those awards come forward. A lot of the rest of it, the back office, the admin-type IT business, I think you're seeing deferred or reevaluated. The prioritizations are taking place and the impact of that is being felt in our businesses right now. How long will that last? My view is that it will last probably until we either get ourselves through a CR or through the next election. I mean, I don't think this is going to go away anytime soon, and I think the whole industry -- the whole information technology space sees that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Jay, just to touch on Marine -- actually, just to touch actually and expand a little bit on your efforts at sort of managing costs. And it's not just at Marine, it's also at Combat, these sort of levels of profitability. What other opportunities are you doing that's just looking for opening the aperture to do things, either like what you're doing with Marine on service or booking of other Combat vehicles that you can bring technology to for upgrading?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, we're always -- look, as I said earlier, we, Howard -- particularly as it applies to Combat Systems, we compete very favorably for all the new stuff, okay, all the new development programs. That's why we're players in Ground Combat Vehicle. But we also know how to work with our customer to service what's already there. Our incumbency puts us in a very strong position there. Double-V hull, Stryker V is a classic example of something that was already there that needed to be enhanced. We enhanced it for the customer. So we're constantly looking for things like that. As to the businesses, and I think to your earliest point, look, you know our model. It's very decentralized. There's great authority and responsibility at the business unit level, and they are working very diligently to manage for profitability. And we've reduced headcounts, we've reduced overhead. And we'll continue to go do that as we go forward to make sure that we can still deliver the results we need for our shareholders.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Jay, just back to the tactical communications. How much of the shortfall in what you maybe expected 6 or 9 months ago is, do you think, just reduced demand from the field as OCO outlays slow? And how much of it is just program-specific delays? And to the degree that it's program-specific delays, could you talk a bit about which programs? I mean, is this HMS? Is this WIN-T? Is it others? Is it a whole bunch of things? And then finally, just looking at OCO in general, what do you guys estimate your OCO spending exposure is in 2011?
Jay L. Johnson: The OCO number in 2011 I don't have off the top of my head, honestly. But I'll just say it's not substantive, in the broader sense. And we've said before that a lot of the OCO that moved away, for us, because of the incumbency that we have, moved back into base budgets. So I mean, our programs are fairly well supported in that regard. To your point about the reduced pull from the field, look, we're very -- our JTRS HMS and WIN-T are very much, shall we say, in demand. You know that #1 priority that the Army has right now is for their network, and that's what we're talking about. So there's another network integration exercise here next month. We are already in LRIP on producing 6,250, as I recall, Rifleman radios, and 100 Manpack PRC-155s. That will come to another production decision earlier in the year after this next exercise. And so we're very bullish on those products. Some of the others, to your first point, it has been manifest because of the acquisition delays that I talked about. But we feel very strongly that our WIN-T and JTRS HMS programs are being very well supported and pushed by the Army. They need them.
Operator: Your last question will come from the line of Rob Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Jay, 2 quick things. First, the talk about potential expansion of Virginia class to 40, 50 boats. What kind of impact benefit might that have for you? And then I have a quick one on Gulfstream.
Jay L. Johnson: A good one. I'm not being smart-aleck about it. Look, we've talked before, Rob, that right now, there are 30 Virginia-class boats in the plan. That clearly does not meet the requirement that the combatant commanders need out there. So going beyond that, I think, is a very logical national security priority. You might expect a former Navy guy to say that, but in point of fact, I believe the combatant commanders validate that virtually every day. So I think the likelihood of expansion beyond 30 is very real. How that all feathers in, how it mixes with SSBN, what you do, when you do it, all that to be determined. But I think from a strategic prioritization, that makes sense at 2 per year, okay, Virginia class.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Could that somehow or another improve cost in the near term? Somehow something gets deferred out into later boats if we get a decision in that direction? And then the last thing I wanted to ask you...
Jay L. Johnson: Rob, just a second. The cost piece, to me, the best way to manage the cost on that program is to stay at 2 a year.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then quickly, what would be the timing on the G450, G550 refresh? And is there some R&D already flowing on that?
Jay L. Johnson: Oh now, Rob, you know I'm not going to answer that question.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Honeywell is already talking about some anticipated avionics awards, so...
Jay L. Johnson: Look, here -- you know that we are very consistent in product development commitment at Gulfstream. That's my answer. We nominally take 2% of sales, whether the top line's going up or down, and commit to product development. We continue to do so. And there'll come a day when the 450 sees a new airplane out there, and the 550; and many, many years from now, the 650. But we continue to refresh these aircraft. Example, out at NBAA, we have something we call Phoenix, which is basically an upgrade enhancement to the interior of the 450 and 550 that is really, really nice, if I do say so myself. That basically puts the cabin management system and the cabin itself -- the galley's upgraded, in the same package, if you will, as you see in the 650 and the 280. So we continue to do that even with the in-production aircraft as we develop product going forward. And we'll stay with that. That's how you stay as the premier brand, and that's how you continue for the long haul in this business. And we've been capitalizing smartly our Gulfstream business since we got it in '99, and we'll continue to do that going forward.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2011 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Caris, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Amy Gilliland, staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Caris, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay Johnson: Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics performed well in the second quarter, delivering $7.9 billion in sales and $949 million in operating earnings. Sales and earnings improved from last quarter, with Combat Systems volumes leading the top line growth. Excellent performance across our 3 Defense groups in the quarter drove 12% company operating margins. Earnings per share totaled $1.79 on a fully diluted basis, $0.11 ahead of last year's second quarter and $0.15 ahead of last quarter. Second quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $658 million, nearly 100% of earnings from continuing operations. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $924 million, well ahead of last year. I expect this robust cash performance to continue in the second half.  Regarding capital deployment, we took advantage of our healthy balance sheet and market conditions to repurchase 11.1 million shares of GD common stock this quarter. Through the first half, our EPS growth has been enhanced by the repurchase of 14.2 million shares. Subsequent to the quarter, we also took advantage of favorable market conditions to issue $1.5 billion in new debt. This issuance increased the average maturity of our debt, reduced our average coupon rate, covered $750 million of notes that matured 2 weeks ago and provided additional flexibility for future capital deployment.  Orders this quarter were nearly $7.5 billion, $300 million more than last year's second quarter, due to particularly strong demand for our Aerospace products and services. Defense bookings were more modest than anticipated because of slower than expected award activity, following the delayed passage of the 2011 defense spending bill in late April. With that said, I anticipate healthier order activity across our Defense segments in the second half. At the end of the quarter, funded backlog was $44.3 billion up $400 million from the first quarter, while total backlog stood at $57.1 billion. Total estimated contract value, which includes opportunities to provide products and services under IDIQ contracts and options, was $78.3 billion.  Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups. First, let's talk about Combat Systems. Combat Systems sales and earnings improved this quarter when compared with last quarter and the second quarter of last year. Sales totaled $2.1 billion, reflecting growing international vehicle volume, particularly foreign military sales of light armored vehicles and somewhat lower U.S. vehicle and engineering volume. Earnings were $299 million, resulting in 14.1% operating margins. This healthy operating margin reflects excellent performance across the group's portfolio of mature production programs. In addition, the group's profitability has been enhanced by ongoing continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives, aiming at ensuring that we remain a competitive, high-quality provider in a tightening market. These efforts were illustrated by several actions taken in the quarter, such as the decision to relocate our European Defense business headquarters to Spain by year-end and the consolidation and resizing of our Guns and Weapons businesses to align with anticipated demand. We also continued our focus on core businesses by divesting the successful but non-core detection business. Combat Systems' backlog totaled $10.8 billion at quarter end. Orders in some of Combat's businesses were somewhat lighter than anticipated this quarter, in part due to the impact of the sluggish contracting environment on our Ordinance and Weapons Systems businesses. Notable orders that were received included approximately $286 million for Hydra rockets, $124 million for MRAP upgrades and $62 million for Stryker Double-V hull engineering. In the second half, we expect additional U.S. awards for more Strykers, additional MRAP upgrades and a Ground Combat Vehicle development contract.  We also expect international production contracts in the second half, including the Canadian LAV upgrade program, 2 awards for an FMS tank upgrade program and a possible launch customer for the newest upgrade to our PIRANHA family of vehicles. Additionally, requests for the next increments of 72 FMS LAVs and 125 Egyptian tank kits are now proceeding through the appropriate approval channels. In total, these international awards could add approximately $1.5 billion to backlog before year-end. Given year-to-date performance, current backlog and anticipated orders, Combat remains on track to achieve my guidance of around $9 billion in sales this year and a 14% operating margin. As we look to the future, the Combat Systems group will be both challenged by an uncertain market environment and bolstered by an array of opportunities. Domestically, our incumbency and unique experience in designing, producing and servicing combat-proven vehicles positions us well. For example, Stryker Double-V, which arrived in Afghanistan in early June, is already saving lives, and the Double-V hull itself is quickly becoming a survivability requirement for all armored vehicles. We will continue to leverage our investment in Double-V in order to offer more survivable, lower-cost solutions for future combat and tactical vehicle fleets. The Abrams tank offers similar potential for further adaptation and modernization. We are encouraged by the strong congressional support we have received thus far in the 2012 budget process. This support will help ensure that the U.S. maintains a healthy and reliable tank industrial base. International vehicle markets and the growth that we expect to arise from several indigenous and foreign military export programs are key to providing relative stability in Combat's outlook over the next several years. We have a $2 billion, multiyear FMS LAV program already in backlog, which helps to mitigate some softening in the U.S. vehicle program sales. In addition, the Canadian LAV upgrade program and FMS tank upgrade program and the expected Spanish 8x8 LAV program will help to further offset pressure in our U.S. vehicle market. In summary, Combat Systems is performing well and continues to build on the success of our franchise programs. As we begin to look into 2012 and even 2013, we certainly have some work to do. But with that said, I remain confident in our ability to provide best-in-class vehicles and weapon systems to U.S. and international customers at affordable prices for years to come. Next, Marine Systems. Marine Systems delivered a solid quarter. Sales in the quarter were down modestly, while earnings were consistent with the prior-year period at $1.6 billion and $161 million respectively. Marine sales reflect lower Destroyer, commercial shipping and T-AKE volume, partially offset by higher submarine, mobile landing platform and repair volume. The lower Destroyer volume is really a timing issue as we fully expect several Destroyer awards in the second half. Margins in the quarter were steady at 10.2%, driven primarily by improved performance on the T-AKE program. The group's funded backlog totaled $9.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $1.1 billion from the end of last quarter. This increase reflects funding for the second FY '11 Virginia-class submarine, several NASSCO repair contracts, additional funding for the DDG 1000 program and an $800 million award for construction of the first 2 MLP ships and long lead material funding for the third. We were very pleased to add these 2 MLPs into our backlog and look forward to another successful program. Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $18.4 billion, down modestly from last quarter.  We now have an agreement with the Navy on DDG's 1001 and 1002, the second and third ships in the class, and expect a contract to follow shortly. Additionally, we are preparing a bid for the Navy's DDG 51 restart Destroyers, and anticipate an award announcement late in the third quarter or perhaps early in the fourth. We also continue to see the need for replacing aging Jones Act commercial ships, but that has yet to translate into orders at NASSCO.  For the remainder of the year, group sales will grow progressively due to continued growth on the Virginia and SSBNX programs and incremental Destroyer volume once we're able to add these ships to backlog. Overall, 2011 sales should be similar to last year, consistent with my prior guidance. Given the group's performance through the first half, Marine margins for the year should be in the high 9% range, better than my earlier guidance. The group's excellent track record of taking cost out of this business and its continued dedication to process improvement, positioned it to remain a leader in designing and constructing the most affordable, reliable ships moving forward. Now to IS&T. Our IS&T group had a good second quarter. Sales were $2.8 billion, while earnings were nearly $300 million. The group's IT service business realized growth throughout the first half, primarily attributable to large IT infrastructure support projects in the DC area, such as the DoD's Mark Center, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the relocation of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency headquarters. IS&T's Tactical Communications business did experience lower volume, particularly in its Shorter Cycle Product business, which includes encryption, mobile and ruggedized computing products. This lighter-than-anticipated volume is primarily a timing issue, the result of both prolonged acquisition cycles and the aftermath of the continuing resolution. We anticipate volume to increase materially in the second half.  IS&T operating margins were 10.7% in the second quarter, 20 basis points better than last year's second quarter and 90 basis points improved from the last quarter. This margin improvement is a direct reflection of the group's ongoing response to top line pressures. In reaction to the new reality of slowed acquisition cycles and less predictable customer award activity, our IS&T businesses are taking prompt action to ensure they remain competitive, including consolidating and adjusting staffing levels across the portfolio. The group's backlog totaled $9.6 billion at the quarter-end, consistent with the prior quarter as book to bill was very nearly 1x. Our IT Service business enjoyed its best order quarter in almost 3 years and helped offset the more sluggish award tempo in our Product and System Integration businesses. IS&T's opportunity pipeline is very robust, and we anticipate full year book to bill to be at or very near 1x. Even with some of the award sluggishness just mentioned, the Tactical Communications business has recently secured several notable contracts. In the United Kingdom, we received a $174 million Bowman support and enhancement contract, critical to maintaining and evolving this franchise product for the British Army. Similarly, following a key Pentagon milestone decision, we were awarded a contract for 6,250 JTRS HMS Rifleman radios and 100 Manpack radios. Our HMS products continue to perform well in testing to include success in a recent Army network integration exercise for the handheld and Manpack variants demonstrated their ability to provide transformational networking capability. The group's IT Service business was also selected from several multiyear IDIQ contracts in the second quarter, including an award to build the IT backbone for the new Department of Homeland Security headquarters. These awards drove a nearly $600 million improvement in the group's potential contract value.  In the second quarter, we announced the acquisition of Fortress Technologies, a provider of secure, wireless networking equipment for the U.S. Military and other government customers. Fortress' product portfolio provides secure, Wi-Fi hotspots for battlefield logistics, convoy and command post users that do not currently enjoy this capability. We also recently announced the acquisition of Network Connectivity Solutions, a provider of enterprise services, cloud computing, and cyber information assurance solutions to the Department of Defense. IS&T's volume in the second half will exceed both last year's second half and this year's first half. For the full year, I expect group sales to be flat to modestly up from last year, a revised outlook that reflects the realities of contract award activity in the first half. Margins will be in the mid-10% range, somewhat higher than my previous guidance. Looking ahead, IS&T's highly diverse portfolio positions the group to leverage its prudent capabilities to capture new business in fast-growing market segments. Now let's move to our Aerospace segment. The Aerospace group's second quarter sales were $1.38 billion, consistent with the year-ago quarter and up modestly from last quarter. Earnings totaled $209 million, resulting in a 15.2% group operating margins. The group's operating margins are down through the first half when compared with last year's period, primarily because of the timing of R&D spending and supplier payments at Gulfstream and to performance challenges at Jet Aviation. Even with the impact of R&D expenditure timing, Gulfstream margins remain robust, and the business is performing extremely well.  In my last quarterly earnings remarks, I noted the problems that Jet is confronting in its Completions business. Specifically, I highlighted that as a result of the economic downturn, Jet's OEM business jet completions volume deteriorated markedly. This loss of OEM volume is aggravated by less than optimal performance on several narrow-body, wide-body contracts. While underperformance is not related to the quality of the products delivered, it has impacted throughput and subsequent volume. Therefore, to better align jet completions to the realities of today's market, we are restructuring the business, eliminating overhead and transforming the management team. We will see continuing improvement in Jet's Completion business as the year progresses. Jet service operations continued to do well, especially the FBO business, as flying hours increased globally. I have great confidence that new management at Jet Aviation and healthy demand for its completions, MRO, FBO and management services will help to ensure improved performance moving forward.  Broader Aerospace market indicators were generally positive again this quarter, when in fact, second quarter Gulfstream orders were the largest we've seen since the economic downturn began. When combined with low customer defaults, this strong order book drove a $428 million increase in the group's backlog in the second quarter. At $18 billion, including an 18 to 24-month delivery window for our in-service large cabin aircraft, our backlog is solid and sustaining. For the year, large and mid-cabin in-production green deliveries remain on track at 80 and 15 to 20 respectively.  Orders through the first half reflect the reality of today's market environment. Customer appetite for large cabin aircraft remains very healthy, while mid-cabin demand continues but at lower levels. International customers represented over 70% of our order book in the first half, with Asia Pacific customers accounting for 50%. When compared with the first half of last year, Asia Pacific orders have more than doubled their share of the order book.  We were also particularly pleased to see a doubling of North American customer orders from the first to second quarter. It's good to see our domestic markets slowly coming back, particularly given recent political rhetoric, which is very harmful to our industry. Gulfstream flying hours continued to improve and have now returned to prerecession levels. This has driven additional growth in our Aircraft Services businesses, which enjoyed another quarter of record-setting service demand. Year-to-date, the group service sales are up almost 20%, with both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation delivering double-digit growth. We're working diligently to ensure that our service network remains well positioned to serve our customers and a growing installed global fleet. In pursuit of this goal, we added 2 new European warehouses this quarter, enhanced our Air Products Support program and introduced new fast teams, able to deploy around the world to deal with customer maintenance needs. Market preowned aircraft levels continued to slowly decline. We had 2 aircraft in inventory at the beginning of this quarter, took 2 additional preowned aircraft in trade during the quarter and have sold all 4 at a modest profit. On the product development front, the G650 returned to flight in late May, and our 4 test aircraft are busily progressing toward certification. While the 2-month delay in flight testing introduced some additional risk into our plan certification schedule, we are pleased with the progress we made since returning to flight. We continue to believe that we can obtain our objective of delivering 10 to 12 green G650 aircraft this year. However, it is fair to assume that these deliveries will happen later in the year than previously planned. The G280, which was recently renamed, also continues to make progress towards certification, having achieved several critical milestones in the quarter to include obtaining engine certification. For the year, I expect the group's sales to grow approximately 14% to 15%, slightly below my prior guidance. Margins will be around 15%, somewhat lower than previously expected, given Jet Aviation's performance through the first half.  As we look to the future, our current order book, healthy pipeline of potential customer orders and continued investments in new aircraft development bode well for the future of our Aerospace group. In summary, General Dynamics delivered a solid first half and is well positioned for success in the second half. I now expect earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be $7.15 to $7.20, an increase from my prior guidance. This revised guidance reflects the changes to segment guidance I provided this morning. The sale of the Detection Systems business, additional interest expense resulting from our debt issuance and share repurchase through the first half. As is our practice, this guidance does not presume further deployment of capital, although our healthy balance sheet affords us great flexibility to do so.  Before I turn the call over to the Hugh, I want to comment briefly on today's dynamic business environment, particularly as it relates to our Defense businesses. As we speak, talks on resolving the nation's debt challenges continue. Although it's not yet certain today how or when the debt ceiling is raised, it is clear that defense spending will play a role in helping to ease the country's economic challenges. The President's recently announced plan, for example, would cut national security spending by $700 billion over the next 10 to 12 years. The distribution of this reduction has not yet been detailed, although it is probable that the largest cuts will target budgets in the second half of the decade, rather than those in the nearer term.  The Pentagon under the guidance of the new Secretary of Defense, is in the midst of a roles in mission study, which will identify an array of options for capturing savings commensurate with the President's plan. While we have no insight into the study it is apparent that senior leadership in the Pentagon intends to make sure that any cuts are made deliberately and with known strategy and capability consequences. Secretary [Leon] Panetta who most certainly understands the multiplicity of threats facing our nation has clearly expressed that he will not create a hollow force. The Secretary has also stated that while he understands the defense cuts are necessary, he does not believe that the country must choose between strong fiscal discipline and strong national security.  As we continue to closely track the conclusions of this study, which will predominantly inform the fiscal year 2013 budget submission, the 2012 defense budget request is proceeding through the Congressional approval process. We have been pleased with the support our programs have received to-date While there are several steps remaining before the 2012 defense bill is enacted, I remain confident that GD's core programs will receive solid Congressional support.  Furthermore, in the event that the 2012 Pentagon budget is funded through a continuing resolution, we remain relatively confident in our outlook, given the robust funding for our programs in the 2011 spending bill. General Dynamics is particularly well positioned to excel in this fast-changing, high-pressure environment. The platform incumbency that we've established, particularly with our Army and Navy customers, will afford us significant opportunities to evolve our defense products in a manner that both addresses emergent warfighter requirements and minimizes costs in the expanding global business jet market and continued investment in our product and service portfolio will help to ensure that our Aerospace segment is the company's growth engine for the next several years. We are taking appropriate actions across this corporation to ensure that we can continue to provide the most capable and affordable products to our customers as we enhance value to our shareholders. With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?
L. Redd: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by following up on Jay's comment regarding the issuance of fixed rate notes subsequent to the quarter. As a result of the increased debt, we now project full-year interest to approximate $140 million, now that's up from our previous expectation of around $130 million.  Also following the end of the quarter, we replaced our $975 million credit facility, which was set to expire in December of this year, and we replaced that with a $1 billion facility expiring on July of 2015. This, together with our facility that expires in July of 2013, maintains $2 billion in backup liquidity for our commercial paper program. Our next scheduled debt maturity is $1 billion of notes due in July -- excuse me, in May of 2013.  With respect income taxes, our effective rate for the first half of the year was 30.8%, consistent with our expectations and with our current outlook for the full year of around 31%. With respect to pensions, as planned, we will make a voluntary contribution to the pension plans totaling $350 million mostly this quarter, this quarter meaning the third quarter of this year. Also, as Jay discussed, we divested the detection systems assets of our Combat Systems group during the quarter. That transaction resulted in a pretax gain of just under $40 million, which you see reported in other income on our income statement. After considering the tax impact of the transaction and adjusting for the second half earnings that were associated with these operations, the transaction has a net favorable impact of approximately $0.03 per share. And that's the impact for the full year.  Finally, with the decision by the Supreme Court to remand the A-12 case to the Federal circuit and the Federal circuit's decision to remand the case to the Court of Federal Claims, we are anticipating a prolonged path to resolution. Accordingly, we accrued our estimate of the additional legal cost [indiscernible] with this revised outlook. And you see that reported in the discontinued operations net of taxes.  With that, I'll turn the time back over to Amy for the Q&A.
Amy Gilliland: Thanks, Hugh. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Caris, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Jay, you mentioned that the mid-cabin area is slightly improving for you. I was wondering if you could give us a feel of how much it's really recovered say sequentially or year-on-year and what your expectations might be for mid-cabin deliveries as we head into next year?
Jay Johnson: Well, look, we see continued activity in the mid-cabin as I highlighted, Rob. It's not -- it certainly doesn't compare with the large cabin activity, but it is -- I would categorize it as being fairly steady at this point. We're going to deliver 15 to 20 this year. I feel very confident in that. It's too early to call next year yet, but I like what we're seeing thus far. And it really is across all the models in our portfolio. I'm reading from other mid-cabin OEMs that they're seeing continued activity as well. So I think slowly but surely, we're getting ourselves back into that market. And as you know, it's not a large portion of Gulfstream, but we're encouraged by what we see across the markets there.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: And as a quick follow-up on the Aircraft this is the third consecutive quarter of demand increase or backlog increase at Gulfstream. At what point do you think we can expect maybe production of the large cabin jets to head higher?
Jay Johnson: Is that part of the first question, Rob?
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: I was just saying that you've had 3 consecutive quarters of demand increases. But I was wondering at what point should we be expecting production of large cabin jets to increase.
Jay Johnson: Well, we keep ourselves, as you know, in the 18 to 24-month backlog, and that's kind of where we are now. We get on the long side of that, we can ramp it up an airplane or 2 and we're not afraid to do that. But for now, I kind of like where we are.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with Lazard Capital Markets
Michael Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Jay, I was wondering if you can expand a little bit more on the jet services restructuring, and more specifically when do you think the operation is right-sized.
Jay Johnson: We're in the process of doing the latter as we speak, Mike. But let me just say there are 2 pieces to this, okay? One in jet is the services business, which is doing quite well. I'll put that aside for this part of the discussion. The Completions business is challenged, as I've described this time and in previous conversation. And it really does come down to OEM volume cutbacks, which have caused us to have to reshape that business. And then the OEM -- sorry the narrow-body wide-body completions. I think the best way for me to describe that is to say that what happened to us at jet completions is that the volume in the front door overcame the throughput efficiency that we had on the deck plates, if you will. And so we brought them in the front door but couldn't get them out the back door in a timely enough manner. When they got out the back door, the quality, the product was fine, wonderful, actually, but it just -- you couldn't get them through the flow. We've taken very, very specific steps, and as I mentioned to reshape that business, to resize it we've put a lot of new talent in there to help those on the shop floor and we feel good about everything we're seeing. But as you would expect -- and, oh, by the way, while we're doing this, we wicked down, if you will, the volume coming in the front door which is, as I mentioned in my remarks, part of the issue with the rest of the year, okay? In terms of volume. That's a temporary condition that is being adjusted, in fact, as we speak to continue more volume in there, now that we're getting our processes and throughput efficiencies in the stride. That won't happen overnight. That will take the rest of the year. But one thing I am certain, as I mentioned in my remarks, with the leadership team we have in place, the management of that production facility over there, I'm very confident that 2012 is going to be a better year for us than 2011. We're just going to have to work our way through it
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr with Stifel, Nicolaus
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'm wondering if you can talk about the budget delays and maybe quantify how much that impacted the quarter, or maybe you could take a stab at that. And then do you see risks that some of the money actually doesn't get spent this year and you start seeing some revenue slip out into 2012.
Jay Johnson: I don't know that I can quantify it, Troy, but I mean, you heard in my remarks. We feel it particularly in IS&T, we particularly feel that in some of the short cycle pieces of Combat Systems, as I said, you're obligating 12 months worth of budget in 5 months. And contractually, that's really hard to do. So we're not the only ones that are saying this, obviously, but it's just the reality that we're dealing with. So things move to the right. Nothing's really falling off the table, but it's just going to take longer. Remember, in Combat in particular, we're ramping markedly in the second half. That's kind of always been the plan, but it's exacerbated somewhat by the CR delta that we're dealing with. IS&T, we're really pleased with the turn at 1x on book to bill or very close to it, and we project that for the year. So we'll gather stride here as we go, we are gathering stride as we go. But inevitably, we're going to push some of it to the right. We are seeing that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Jay, could you give us a little bit more color about the kind of the elements of profitability in the second quarter and the year at Aerospace? Specifically how much was the R&D and SG&A up sequentially, given we know the R&D was higher and presumably with the good orders, the commissions were higher and where was jet's profitability? Was it slack? What kind of level and what kind of ramp can we expect going forward? Are we going to be see more expenses in the second half, or is the profitability going to get better?
Jay Johnson: Gulfstream, as I said, Cai, it continues to do extremely well. I think that -- let's talk about the R&D for a second. Net R&D is up this quarter. That's really a function of not the R&D itself growing much at all. It's a function of the launch assistance being, for example, 1/3 of what it was last quarter. It's kind of timing. For the year, you know well we're kind of the 2% to 3% folks with our net R&D investment. We're still there. So it's a quarterly blip, if you will, against a year that's essentially a little bit higher, but not much higher than we normally see. Some of that has to do with 650, some of that has to do, in terms of our spend, some of it has to do with across the product portfolio. But the R&D expense is a little bit higher this quarter, no question about it. Jet. The profitability of Jet, as I indicated before, we were challenged, we're challenged right now. It's going to take, I would suggest, several quarters to work our way through this. But I'm encouraged by what I see and each quarter will be better than the one before it.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG: Jay, I'd like to ask a strategic question on Marine and clearly understanding the uncertainty at hand here, perhaps this can leverage your vast naval experience. I'd like to talk about the ship plan long-term and where you see the pressure points. So for example can Virginia class and SSBN(X) crowd one another out, might they have to share funding? There has been talk that we can put ballistic missiles potentially on a Virginia class? Do you see pressure points on the carriers? How do you see this long-term? Because at some point, one would imagine that the ship plan is going to come under some pressure.
Jay Johnson: I don't disagree with you at all, Rob, on the reality that the shipbuilding budget will come under some pressure. I would suggest maybe the term -- the numbers may be different, but the shipbuilding budget, historically, has always seemed -- my experience is that it always seems to come under some pressure. But that said, the things you talk about are very relevant in that. Look you've heard this from me before, we are a global Navy, we will always be a global Navy. To be a global Navy, thou shalt have large combatant vessels, okay? You need carrier strike groups, okay? You need submarines, both attack submarines and ballistic missile submarines. And you need surface combatants and all auxiliaries attendant to that force. That's not going to change, okay? How we shape it is the challenge. And you've heard me say again, in times past on the surface combatant side, the DDG 51 is going to be, I believe, the long-term mainstay for the surface combatant Navy, okay? There's a whole new flight of ballistic missile-capable 51s that will be coming in the next tranche. And we'll be building 51s, I believe, for quite some time to come. The points you make about the submarines is a very big part of the challenge I think for the Navy, and frankly for the country, in terms of dealing with the requirement for Virginia-class submarines to replace the Los Angeles class, as well as the Ohio replacement program for the SSBN(X) or whatever they're going to end up calling it. Will they compete against each other? My sense would be yes, they would. But we're going to have to figure out a way forward that accommodates both of them because the requirements are fairly well sacrosanct. There's a lot of talk, as you highlighted, about do we put another missile and modify the Virginia class? Look, I don't know. I don't know where that's going to go. But the strategic requirement for the ballistic missile submarine is inviolate, okay? It is the most survivable leg of the strategic triad. And nobody's talking about doing anything with that. It's a question of how you manifest the Ohio replacement program going forward. As you would expect, we're in the thick of that with our electric boat engineering and development efforts, and we'll help shape that outcome as we go forward. But that will be a very robust discussion. The carriers, my background keeps me interested in carriers, but my business doesn't deal with carriers at this point. So I'll let Mike Petters talk about the carriers.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Jay, following up on that a little bit at marine. Obviously the performance in the quarter was strong. You raised the margin guidance there. But can you talk about looking forward the outlook for Marine, particularly the trade of MLP or T-AKE leaving, going away and the trade for MLP? And then as a follow-up on share repurchase, obviously a much higher level than what we see in the past. Can you talk about the sustainability of repurchasing shares of this kind of level going forward?
Jay Johnson: Okay. Look, let me take them backwards. The share repurchases, you know that we're tactical share repurchasers. We've always done it that way. We'll continue to buy shares when the market tells us that it's appropriate to buy our shares. So whenever that's the case, we'll be in the market. I mean, we keep the authorization up and we're very, very pleased with the value we're creating with our share repurchase program, particularly when you look at us with the Aerospace growth engine that we've got and what's coming in the next 5 to 7 years, buying back our shares right now, we think is a really good move for our shareholders. That said, now let's talk about T-AKE and MLP. They're actually feathering together -- my words, not Fred Harris' words, they're feathering together very nicely out at NASSCO and will flow one right into the other to be followed by, I believe yet to be detailed, but followed by the TAOX program. So that part of NASSCO, the Navy build at NASSCO if you will, looks very positive for us going forward. The T-AKE performance is superb. You heard me say that, you see it in the numbers, I would suggest that the MLP performance will be likewise very, very, very strong because the design for that MLP is that it was as complete, is as complete as any ship we've ever built. So we know exactly what we're doing as we build that series of 3 vessels, and are very confident in our ability to generate really good margins out of it, okay? So don't forget also that we've got other volume impacts, if you will, out at NASSCO. One is the repair work, which is steady and actually increasing, which I think last year was like a quarter of their sales and earnings. That will continue, as I said. The commercial side is still out there. I mean if you look at the addressable market in Jones Act ships alone, nearly 100 ships. Sooner or later, that market is going to have to get serviced because the Jones Act ships are getting very old and they're going to have environmental, et cetera, challenges as you know, single-hull, double hull. We've talked about some of that before. We have not translated any of that into contract yet, but that market will come back. So we think NASSCO is in a great position right now, and as you know there are premier shipyards. So we're proud of what we're doing at T-AKE. Underway, I saw my first picture. I haven't been out there yet to see it, but I saw my first picture of MLP yesterday and it's real, okay? It's in the build, MLP 1 is very real. So we're anxious to get it in the water.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Jay, could you talk a little bit about the 650 and sort of the changes that have been brought about as a result of the accident and where you go from here? I know you sort of said it'll be a little tight to get the year done, but how is the airplane performing? And I mean, some of the other things that I'm sure you had questions that you've not heretofore been able to answer.
Jay Johnson: Well, listen, I'm very pleased with what's happening with 650 as I said in my remarks. I mean, we're back in the air, we're flying our test points and proceeding towards certification. Yes, it's going to be later in the year. I'm not aware, Howard, I'm not aware of anything material, shall we say, or significant that's been changed or that we're doing to the airplane that would cause certainly a need to be concerned about it. It's performing beautifully. So off we go. I still, as reflected in the guidance that I delivered today, I still am really confident that we're going to get 10 to 12 green deliveries this year. And so I'm still on the 650 bullishness if you will. The backlog in 650 continues to increase, okay? We're taking orders for 650, so it's still a great program for us.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Jay, you mentioned, I guess, in Combat Systems about relocating the headquarters and resizing the Gun and Weapons Systems. And then also in Jet, talking about the restructuring and reduction overhead. Can you just talk about what kind of costs you might be absorbing in both of those businesses for those restructuring, either whether it was in the second quarter or just prospectively? And then I guess within Gun and Weapons, is that also potentially an allowable cost as well?
Jay Johnson: I'm not going to quantify any cost. I mean, these are good business leaders that are running their businesses to become more efficient, given the realities of the world. I mean the savings and the macro terms are probably de minimis. But it's important for them to maintain their competitiveness and efficiency, and that's exactly what they're doing. It made sense for us to move the headquarters of our European Land Systems out of Vienna into Madrid. Why? Because European Land Systems' core of business is resident in Spain. It's things like that, that just make good business sense. More opportunities will come to us with the Spanish headquarters for ELS than was the case previously. So it's the charge I give to the business leaders. It's a charge I give to the business leaders to run their businesses to be more competitive and efficient that will continue. There are others I didn't even talk about this morning in IS&T and other places where we've resized some of the businesses to maintain our competitiveness.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Yes, Jay, on the G650, a question in a different way, can you talk about how the production is going on the plane? And I'd like to get some thinking about how you plan to make rate decisions. Is it going to be based on milestones or is it going to be calendar? Are you waiting to see the number of planes built before you make a right decision?
Jay Johnson: No, I mean -- the rate decisions -- we have given you the rates that I see for the next several years are really going to be determined by how our -- as I use the words, how our battle rhythm develops down in the production facility at Gulfstream, how the vendors and the supply chain feed into that production center that you've seen down there. That's really going to determine, I think, the pace. As we've talked many times in the past, when you've got over 200 in backlogs, the desire to increase the rheostat of production is a very real one, but you don't want to do it before you're ready. So I'm very comfortable with the pacing we've got right now, but the production is going just fine. There's no -- we're moving along, we're building airplanes, it's full. The production facility has lots of G650s in there right now. We'll go see them next week, as a matter-of-fact. So I'm very encouraged by what I see down there. But again, we're going to pace the production to our ability to deliver what we say we're going to deliver
Operator: And your next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Jay, on the 650, is it still operating or flying under a restricted envelope or has that been lifted? And as we look at the margins for the business, your guidance implies 14% in the second half of the year, and I know the problem's at Jet, but you said that's going to improve every quarter. And so, what else is going on there? Why are the margins down on the second half? Are you lowering your expectations for 650 margins?
Jay Johnson: No, Joe, the 650 -- I'm still where I was in probably our earlier discussions on 650. That's going to hit with margins that are accretive to the group, but not certainly what we see in our in-production large cabin aircraft. And we'll work our way over time through the latter of those 2. So I'm fine there. What it really boils down to, to your specific point on the second half, is Jet still -- okay, and I mentioned earlier, it's going to take us several quarters to work through this. But it's also at Gulfstream side, a little bit of mix, okay? More I said we're going to do 15 to 20 on the mid-cabin. And I think the number we had in the first half was 7. So we're going to have a little mix shift there. And I think in the second half, we've also got perhaps a little bit more 450 than we had in the first half. So you're going to see some of that less liquidated damages and a little bit higher as I said before R&D expense in the second half. But overall, the Gulfstream side is very strong with the elements I just mentioned. And we're going to work our way through Jet, okay. Now to your other point, about the restricted envelope, I believe that is still the case. But it is certainly not affecting our ability to proceed along our test path if you will, and at the appropriate point if they need to adjust, I'm sure between Gulfstream and the FAA, they'll adjust. But for now, we're proceeding apace and I like everything I'm hearing about our 650 test program. And I mentioned it in my remarks as well, but I thought that since you asked about 650, I would also suggest that the 280 side is proceeding very nicely toward certification as well. That's a sweet airplane, as I've talked before.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Jay, I was wondering if we could get you to reset your -- or give us the latest sort of medium- to long-term kind of 3- to 4-year outlook for Combat. And I feel like there was a period where you all were describing combat as a steady, low single-digit grower over the medium- to long-term. And it is unclear that you still feel that way. Is that the case and can you just update us there?
Jay Johnson: I think the way I'd characterize it was suggested in my remarks, Noah, that it's a very dynamic environment. And I think I certainly am confident in what I see this year as I reaffirmed this morning. I've got a pretty good sight line, I think, based on what went in and what next year's going to look like. But then I think we need to see a couple of things. One, we need to see what our customer, our army customer does with their combat vehicle review that's ongoing and should come out before too much longer, which will inform us. And so their views of basically all the major platforms. And then I think we all, all of us, need to look at what happens with what's going on right now in terms of the debt ceiling and all appended to that. And very specifically, as it applies to the Defense businesses, the roles and mission study that's underway. And I think that will be the best source of look-ahead knowledge if you will beyond say the year 2012. I mean, I just think anybody who said they've got a clear sight line on 2013 and beyond I think is making it up.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Jay, I was hoping you could help me out with the IS&T margin performance. I think you said the IT business was actually up and growing, the C4 is where you're seeing the top line pressure. And I'm just trying to understand, obviously a good performance on the margin side given what I would expect would be an otherwise adverse mix. So have IT margins really structurally gotten better or is there anything in the quarter? And then a clarification on repo. I think you authorized another 10 million shares in the quarter. But it seems like you exhausted that. Just curious, is this going to become more of a flow authorization of share repurchase than anything else?
Jay Johnson: We have not gone through our authorization. That's just a fact. I mean, we've got more repo we could do if the market talks to us appropriately. But as your IT margins, they, like everyone else, are very aggressively taking costs out of their business and reshaping and performing extremely well. And I give that the most credit, that We're very competitive and we're very good at what we do across that very diverse portfolio. So all elements of our IS&T business are performing very well right now. So I mean, they're mature programs, Tactical Communications, good execution in IT service, bringing home some big contracts and outperforming those contracts. I'm very pleased with what we've seen in IS&T. Very bullish on the whole group.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2011 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jeff, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, Ms. Gilliland.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay Johnson: Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered another quarter marked by strong operating performance. This performance is particularly notable in light of the dynamic environment that the lengthy fiscal year 2011 continuing resolution created.  Revenues in the first quarter were $7.8 billion, up modestly from the first quarter of 2010 due to growth in our Marine and IS&T businesses. Operating earnings were $929 million, and earnings from continuing operations were $618 million in the quarter, up slightly from the same period last year. Operating margins improved 10 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 11.9%, as 3 of the 4 groups delivered improved earnings and margins. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.64 on a fully diluted basis, up 6.5% when compared with last year. Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $266 million, better than last year's first quarter. Consistent with prior years, I would expect our cash trajectory to be back-half loaded.  In terms of capital deployment, we repurchased 3.1 million of our shares in the first quarter. And in March, our board increased the dividend 12%, the 14th increase in as many years. First quarter orders remain healthy in our Aerospace business, as backlog expanded for a second consecutive quarter. Defense orders, however, were somewhat light. This lower defense order intake is in part a timing issue caused by the prolonged resolution of this year's Defense Appropriations Bill. With its recent passage, we expect healthier order activity in the coming weeks and months.  At the end of the quarter, backlog totaled $57.6 billion down from year end. Timing of marine orders drove 3/4 of this reduction in backlog. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts totaled $78.2 billion. Now I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business segments, starting with Aerospace. Before I address the quarter, I want to update you on the status of the G650 program. As you know, on April 2, the G650 test aircraft was lost in a tragic accident that took the lives of 4 dedicated Gulfstream pilots and flight engineers. The National Transportation Safety Board is in charge of investigating this accident, and Gulfstream is fully cooperating with their team. A preliminary report was published by the NTSB on April 6. As the NTSB investigation continues, Gulfstream is moving forward with all other nonflying certification and production work on the G650. We are working closely with the FAA in consultation with the NTSB to determine when it is appropriate to resume test flights. We look forward to continuing the rigorous testing required to achieve type certification. I remain confident that the G650 will take its place atop a long line of safe, reliable, high-performance business jets on which Gulfstream has built its superb reputation. With that said, I understand that all of our stakeholders would like and deserve a much more fulsome briefing on what lies ahead for the G650 program. Given where we are in the investigative process, however, there is really nothing more I can add at this time. When we have more clarity and can provide an informed update, rest assured, we will do so. Now let me address the Aerospace group's first quarter. Aerospace delivered another very strong quarter, marked by particularly good operating performance at Gulfstream and robust demand for new aircraft and aircraft services. The group's revenues approximated last year's first quarter at $1.4 billion. This result reflects growth in aircraft service demand, offset by lower completions work at Jet Aviation and the absence of preowned aircraft sales. First quarter revenues were up nearly 7% over the fourth quarter of last year due to additional Gulfstream new aircraft volume and growing global demand for aircraft services. Gulfstream green deliveries in the first quarter included 4 additional aircraft when compared to last quarter. The group's operating earnings were $230 million, and margins were 17% improved when compared with both last quarter and the prior year period. The group's better-than-anticipated margins derived from Gulfstream's improved productivity and from liquidated damages recognized following the cancellation of aircraft options by a fractional customer. We continue to see improved conditions in the business aviation market, including healthy new order interest, declining pre-owned inventory levels and robust aftermarket demand spurred by further improvements in aircraft utilization. To that last point, Gulfstream flight hours are now approaching 2008 levels, 2008 levels. Gulfstream participated in another quarter of notable order intake with international orders continuing to dominate the order book. Orders from the Asia Pacific region were particularly strong this quarter, including an order for 5 large cabin aircraft that will further expand our footprint in China. First quarter orders favored all 3 of our large cabin aircraft models. Gross new aircraft book-to-bill was 1.2x on a dollar-denominated basis in the quarter. Orders continued to significantly outpace defaults which were at their lowest levels in the quarter since the downturn began. This helped the group's backlog to grow for a second consecutive quarter. At $17.9 billion, backlog continues to keep us in the 18- to 24-month window from newer aircraft order to delivery for our 450 and 550 large cabin aircraft. Pre-owned inventory levels across the Aerospace market reflect modest improvement. We took 2 pre-owned aircraft in trade this quarter, with one of these aircraft available for sale at the end of the quarter and the other under contract for April delivery. Aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul demand was solid in the quarter, with both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation posting their strongest revenue quarters ever. We are working diligently to expand our global service footprint as our international installed customer base grows. For example, Jet Aviation has just upgraded its MRO and FBO location in Singapore. Eventually, this Singapore facility will include a second hangar capable of accommodating numerous Gulfstream G650s and an engine overhaul shop that will dramatically reduce the cost of shipping engines to the United States and the United Kingdom. While Jet Aviation experienced continuing demand at its Service business, the Completions business remained challenged due to lower OEM completions volume, following the economic downturn and throughput delays at its wide-body, narrow-body facility. As a result, Jet is taking steps to restructure this business, reduce overhead and enhance Completions productivity. For the year, I'm still guiding to 15% to 16% top line growth and 15.5% to 16% margins at Aerospace. Now let's move to the Defense businesses, starting with Combat Systems. Combat Systems is off to a good start, with each of the 4 Combat businesses contributing to the group's solid operating margin performance in the quarter. Revenues were nearly $2 billion, essentially flat when compared with last year's first quarter and in line with our plan for the year. Revenues in the quarter reflected increased international vehicle volume, including growth on a major LAV export program and work on a number of wheeled vehicle programs for European customers. This additional international work helped to mitigate a decline in U.S. vehicle revenues caused by fewer domestic Abrams tank upgrades and less Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle development work. Volume was essentially flat at our Weapons and Ordinance businesses. Combat Systems delivered $277 million of operating earnings in the quarter, up slightly from last year's first quarter. The group's operating margins were 14.2%, 80 basis points higher than last year. Cost savings and continuous improvement initiatives across the segment drove margin improvement, with additional benefit from a favorable program mix that included less vehicle development work. Combat Systems backlog declined modestly from year end to $11.4 billion. Despite this decline in backlog, there were several notable awards in the first quarter, including contracts to produce armored personnel carrier hulls for a foreign government, provide 120-millimeter mortar ammunition for the Marine Corps' expeditionary fighter support system and demilitarize several types of munitions, including cluster bombs. We anticipate improved order activity at Combat Systems as the year progresses. Several awards expected before year end include funding for the first tranche of an FMS tank upgrade program; additional Stryker Double-V vehicles and an opportunity to participate in the initial phase of a Ground Combat Vehicle development program. Several additional award opportunities that may happen this year, but are not integral to our 2011 results, include additional MRAP upgrade opportunities, the production award for the Canadian LAV upgrade program, another tranche of FMS LAVs, the next increment in the Egyptian tank program and the Spanish 8x8 vehicle program. While we have not yet seen any international opportunities come off the table, we remain very mindful of the impact that dynamic, political and economic developments can have on the timing of international awards. For the year, I continue to expect Combat Systems to deliver approximately $9 billion in sales and around 14% operating margins. My revenue guidance reflects a stable outlook for our Weapons and Munitions businesses, some decline in U.S. vehicle programs and growth in our international vehicle markets. As I've previously highlighted, we expect sales and earnings to grow in each of our 4 combat businesses every quarter, resulting in a particularly strong second half. Next, I'll discuss Marine Systems. Marine Systems continued to perform admirably in the first quarter. Group revenues were $1.7 billion, while operating earnings were $167 million; both up slightly compared to a year ago. The earnings increase is particularly notable in light of mix shift within several of the group's programs. Marine's top line reflects higher submarine, auxiliary and repair volume, offset by lower destroyer and commercial work when compared to last year's first quarter. The higher submarine volume relates to our work on both the Virginia class, as we move to 2 boats a year, and the Ohio class replacement. This program passed a major Pentagon development milestone in the quarter, enabling it to enter the technology development phase. Lead ship procurement is planned for 2019. And the Navy shipbuilding plan reflects the significant funding increase over the next several years to support that schedule. Electric Boat is the design agent for the program and is working closely with our Navy customer as this program moves into the next phase. Marine Systems' 10% operating margins were a 20-basis point improvement from last year's first quarter. This margin is driven by NASCO and particularly noteworthy performance on the T-AKE auxiliary program. We launched the 12th T-AKE USNS William McLean into San Diego Bay 2 weekends ago and remain on track to deliver the ship later this year and the remaining 2 T-AKEs, numbers 13 and 14, next year. The group's backlog totaled $18.7 billion at the end of the quarter, down from year end 2010. This decline in backlog is primarily a timing issue, as we continue to anticipate adding several Navy ships to backlog this year. With the CR behind us, we expect to receive the contract modification for the second FY '11 Virginia class submarine very shortly, enabling us to move this submarine from unfunded to funded backlog. We remain in negotiations with the Navy on the Mobile Landing Platform, MLP, and the 2 remaining Zumwalt Class destroyers, DDGs 1001 and 1002. While negotiations have been slower than we had anticipated, we continue to expect to move these ships into our backlog this quarter. We also expect to finalize the contract for the first of the DDG 51 follow-on ships at Bath later this year. In addition to our Navy work, we continue to see interest across the range of Jones Act commercial shippers and believe that we will leverage our Product Carrier success to win new commercial work as these potential customers start awarding new contracts. Marine Systems remains on track to achieve my guidance of relatively flat sales this year. As work begins on several new ships and we experience further mix shift in our surface combatant workload throughout the year, I continue to anticipate margin compression that should lead -- should result in full year operating margins in the low 9% range. Next, IS&T. The Information Systems and Technology group delivered a good first quarter, particularly in the face of the prolonged CR. Group revenues grew 2% to $2.8 billion from the first quarter of 2010 due to higher volume on several programs in our IT service business. IS&T's earnings were $276 million, and operating margins were 9.8%. While both earnings and margins were down from last year's first quarter, this decline was due in part to program mix as this year's first quarter represented a higher percentage of IT service program volume when compared with the prior year. While IT service work provides an excellent return on investment, profitability on these types of programs is generally lower than more product-intensive programs. IT service margins also reflect the competitive dynamics of this marketplace, particularly as IDIQ multiple source contracting vehicles have become much more prevalent over the last 18 to 24 months. IS&T's backlog was $9.7 billion at the end of the quarter as the group achieved a book-to-bill of 0.9x. This indicates continued demand for the group's products and services despite resource constraints and delays in contract awards imposed by the CR. This quarter's order activity was especially strong at our Tactical Communications and IT Service businesses, demonstrating continued success in capturing business in faster growing market segments, such as Battlefield Communications, Cyber and IT Emission services. We had a number of notable IS&T awards in our Tactical Communications business this quarter, including a contract for our core Warfighter Information Network Tactical, WIN-T, program. The nearly $300 million WIN-T Increment 2 award in the quarter, fund network development to another 5 brigade combat teams and represents the customer's dedication to rapidly deploying the significantly enhanced on-the-move broadband capability to the Warfighter. WIN-T provides the network that our JTRS radios will leverage to enhance soldier communications on the battlefield. Our HMS Rifleman and Manpack radios underwent further successful field testing in the quarter, where they proved their ability to provide significantly enhanced situational awareness and connectivity to soldiers at the company and squad level. We anticipate a Low Rate Initial Production decision on Rifleman radio soon and on the Manpack before year end. When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contracts totaled $24.8 billion, providing IS&T ample opportunity for continued growth. IS&T remains well positioned to achieve my guidance of approximately 3% to 5% sales growth and low to mid 10% margins this year. Although in recent periods, IS&T margins have been somewhat consistent throughout the year, we expect them to increase throughout 2011 as contract mix reflects increased tactical communications volume in the second half. In summary, our first quarter provides a solid foundation for a successful year. As is our custom at this early point in the year, I am reiterating my full year guidance of $7 to $7.10. This guidance presumes second half G650 deliveries. However, it does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our backlog and continuing to identify new opportunities. General Dynamics' key programs did very well in the FY '11 budget recently passed by Congress. Program funding included $1.2 billion for Stryker, $521 million for Abrams, $223 million for EFV, $591 million for WIN-T, $787 million for JTRS and support for all of our ship programs, including DDG 51, Virginia-class submarines and the Mobile Landing Platform which received $500 million for an additional ship beyond what was in the President's budget. Our programs are also well supported in the FY '12 budget request. There is clearly significant angst and uncertainty surrounding the level of future defense spending, particularly given President Obama's recent remarks. We recognize that as the country deals with the urgent requirement to reduce national debt, previous predictions regarding defense spending are changing. While it is impossible to know what will come from the administration's roles and missions study and the President's announced intention to find more savings in the defense budget, there are a few things that remain evident. First, in this pressured budget environment, it is very likely the case that defense top line spending will begin a slow, steady decline. I believe the programs most at risk are likely to be the new development programs. As such, incumbency is particularly salient. While we continue to pursue new development programs, we remain focused on leveraging our incumbency to help our customer identify solutions that affordably improve the warfighting capability of existing platforms. Second, the world remains a dangerous place, and current force structure is sized to this threat environment. Going forward, our nation's tolerance for risk must continue to acknowledge the global threat. That should mean only modest adjustments to force structure. Secretary of Defense Gates has already warned that deep defense budget cuts would be calamitous. His eventual successor will confront the same national security reality. As General Dynamics plans for the future, we will continue to evaluate the long-term defense spending environment realistically. GD is well positioned to sustain our business in a declining defense top line environment, given our current footprint in Army and Navy force structure and the opportunities inherent in our Aerospace business. Our lean, agile business model, solid balance sheet and ability to generate earnings and efficiently convert them to cash afford us great flexibility to deploy capital to further enhance our business. With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial highlights.
L. Redd: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to make a few observations about debt, interest expense, taxes and pension contributions. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $430 million of net debt, up slightly from year end, and this is after returning over $470 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Our next scheduled debt maturity is $750 million of notes due in July. As we get closer to July, we will make a decision to either repay that debt from cash on hand or to issue new obligations.  Our net interest expense in the quarter was $34 million, down from $44 million a year ago. This resulted from repayment last year of $700 million of fixed rate notes. For the full year, we expect interest expense to be around $130 million, that assuming of course that we don't refinance the notes that are due in July. With respect to income taxes, the first quarter effective rate of 31% was consistent with our expectations and with our current outlook for the full year. Finally, we remain on track to make a voluntary contribution of $350 million to our pension plans in the third quarter of this year.  That completes my remarks. Amy, I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.
Amy Gilliland: [Operator Instructions] Jeff, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question of the day comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch: Just to maybe start off with a Gulfstream question, the order activity in the quarter, can you characterize at what part of the world it came from? What was going on with the mid-sized aircraft if you're starting to see a pickup there, and if there was any impact to Gulfstream due to the instability in the Middle East?
Jay Johnson: Okay. I'd be happy to take that question. The order activity, Ron, was -- I would say very well spread across the product line. Large cabin dominating, yes, but we're also taking mid-cabin orders. The demographics of that are very heavily weighted to international, pretty consistent with what we've been saying in previous quarters. But actually in this quarter, it was even more so -- I mean, like 70-some percent international. A large portion of that came from Asia Pacific, probably half of that at least came from Asia Pacific and, as I mentioned, China being a major part of that. So it was a good dispersion, if you will, on the international space across the product line. Mid-sized activity continues. I would not characterize it as robust but certainly, improving the pre-owned inventory that's out there is working its way through the system. There's still more to come as I think you know. But for us, we are seeing continued mid-cabin activity, and we are taking orders to include our G250. The Middle East, I would characterize it as being about 10% of our backlog at Gulfstream, and that's proceeding. I would say that the order activity has probably slowed somewhat in the Middle East, as you'd probably expect but nothing drastic in terms of falloff or cancellations or what have you there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Campbell with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: It's actually Carter Copeland and Joseph Campbell. Just a quick question on your comment about the 650. You said you were moving forward with the nonflying test activities and production. Is there a point in the NTSB investigation and how long that stretches out, where you have to change that sort of strategy in terms of production and what's going on? Do you reach a point where you need to slow that activity down, and when might that be? How are you thinking about that?
Jay Johnson: Well, I mean, I guess the answer would be there would be a point. But that's not something that is of immediate concern here at all. It's a very deliberate process as both of you know, and the NTSB controls that process. But rest assured, Gulfstream is working with the NTSB and the FAA, as I said in my remarks, to analyze, to determine, to move forward as smartly as we can. To put a specific time line on that right now is just not something that I can do. But I would tell you that just to reaffirm, we are proceeding with all nonflying activity as it applies to the 650 program and our other programs as you’d expect. But specific to the 650 and at this time, reflected in me not changing my guidance, I don't see any impact to the year. We'll see how that goes obviously. But I don't want to presuppose anything from the NTSB. They have a very tough job to do, and we're helping them as best we can, and we'll get to a resolution here and return to flight at some point. I'm just not going to try to put a time line on that, except to say that I believe it's being treated as you would expect it to be treated very seriously with great discipline, with great analysis on both Gulfstream's part and the other entities. And we'll come to a safe decision here as soon as it's practical to do so. I realize that probably doesn't satisfy your desire for specifics, but that's about as specific as I can be right now.
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: I think it's less on the conclusion that the NTSB may draw and when they will draw them and more internally how GD is -- how Gulfstream is proceeding with production, and what your views on that which you do control outside of the NTSB investigation.
Jay Johnson: Well, I've said very consistently that we anticipated about a dozen green deliveries this year, and we're proceeding along that pathway. And we are unencumbered on that pathway at this point with the exception of, quite obviously, type certification for the aircraft. So at this time, we continue to proceed. And at such time that we have to modify that, we'll make those adjustments and tell you. But that's certainly not the case now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with SunTrust.
Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Jay, can you just talk to us about the pricing realized at Gulfstream during the quarter on new aircraft versus the pricing in backlog, and maybe you can give a differential, large versus mid-sized?
Jay Johnson: I think the way I’d characterize it, Peter, is the pricing is very, very firm on the large cabin and a little bit softer in the mid cabin, which I think is consistent across the industry right now, just as a function of mid-cabin inventory that's out there. But the large cabin pricing is very strong and holding.
Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, okay. And then can I ask you that there's a lot of reports about potential for an Abrams line break, I think in 2013? Can you talk to us about that and then also the outlook for Stryker as well?
Jay Johnson: That part of the first question? I'll take it because somebody else will ask it. But listen, there is work to be done as it applies to Abrams to your point. And we know that, and the customer knows that, and everybody knows that. If you look at the Army's lay down of heavy brigade combat teams with some 24 of them with 60 Abrams apiece, that and the industrial base issue that's attendant to that beautiful facility out in Lima, Ohio, we all realize that we've got some work to do to get from the multiyear that completes next year to the next phase, which some are saying doesn't need to start until 2016. So there’s -- filling that space with valid work is, I would characterize, a work in progress right now. Everybody is realizing that we've got something to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: So Jay, your R&D was down fairly substantially in the first quarter, and you delivered 2 more large biz jets than we’d assumed on a pace to do 80, and yet you really said you’d do 78 excluding the G650. Is R&D going to be building as we go through the remainder of the year at Gulfstream, and can you do more than 78 non-650s? And lastly, if you don't know what the problem is, how can you still feel you're going to do 12 650s for this year?
Jay Johnson: The R&D is net, and we had more alliance assistance in the first quarter, I think is the first answer. And as to the incremental production on the in-production large cabin, Cai, we do have some opportunity there to add an airplane or 2 as we kind of talk about every year. So there's some maneuver space there. And look, I'm not going to go into much more than I've already said about the 650, except to reiterate that at this point, I said we would deliver approximately 12 green 650s this year, and I'm still in a place in the year where I believe we can do that. And obviously, the type certification and the FAA restart with the NTSB authorization is elemental to that. But at this point, I'm quite comfortable suggesting that we carry out the plan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: You mentioned that you were having some throughput problems on the Completions business. Can you provide a little bit more detail as to what the issues are there and the time frame for completing the restructuring that's going on there and the impact that, that might have on margins for that business over time?
Jay Johnson: Well, I think the way I’d characterize it, Jason, is it's a number of things, and I mentioned some of that in my prepared remarks. But you've got an OEM, how do I characterize it, shortfall, I guess, as a result of completions activity resulting from an economic downturn. The valley of that, that we're dealing with which then when you butt it against the narrow-body, wide-body work that's out there, the flow and the rhythm and the volume and the overhead and all of those things kind of come together. And you'd say, you know what, we may need to retool this business a little bit given the new scope of activity that we are seeing. That's probably the easiest way to say it. The margins I would anticipate would improve throughout the year. We're working very diligently to do that. And as I mentioned also, the other parts of Jet Aviation which really is what we bought Jet Aviation for – the global footprint, the service, the MRO -- is coming along quite handsomely.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: Great. And then to the one thing that you haven't mentioned about the G650, and sorry to ask a second question, but what's the customer feedback then at this point?
Jay Johnson: The customer feedback has been very supportive, very concerned in terms of the losses that we've suffered and basically reaffirming their desire to get their airplanes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research Group.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Jay, I heard your comment about international vehicle awards, that they're not coming off the table. But some defense companies are noting that some international customers aren't taking deals off the table, but they are sliding planned purchases to the right. Was wondering if you just might comment on whether you're seeing similar trends for Combat.
Jay Johnson: We have seen some of that indeed, Richard, and we talked about some of that last year, and there was movement to the right. Yes, indeed, we still see that, I mean, the Spanish 8x8s are probably the most talked about example of that. We still believe that the Spanish 8x8 based on what everything the Spanish government is saying, the MoD is saying, will come to a decision this year. But we haven't seen it yet and that's why I mentioned I think that, that's not integral to our sales plan for the year. So yes, we are seeing some movement to the right. Having said that though, we’ve still got a lot of work ongoing. We're in production on -- development on the Specialist Vehicle in the United Kingdom where we're doing the first tranche of FMS tank upgrades at Lima right now and expect the production contract later this year. So we're doing between the FMS LAVs and the FMS tanks, there's lots of activity still apace with more to come that perhaps could be delayed. But right now, we've got a lot that's already in train which is good.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Jay, you started to talk about Gulfstream in China, and I wanted to ask you to elaborate on that just because there's obviously a great long-term opportunity there, and the debate is timing. And I think most think it's pretty long dated and there are some hurdles there. We were just out there. We met with some of your folks actually and were surprised with the comments that the Western companies out there were making about how quickly that is actually turning now. And so I wanted to get your kind of personal stance on that topic. And then strategically, if you feel like you need to do anything there to have a bigger presence than you already do, whether it’s JV-ing or moving facilities there or whatever.
Jay Johnson: Your latter first. I mean, that is a very active market, and the pacing I think is picking up to a degree that perhaps -- I won't use the word surprised, but I mean it's accelerating, shall we say. But as I have said before, we're very mindful of the need to match the product support with the sales. So we're working very diligently with -- and to your last point about JVs and partnerships, that's the way you do business over there right now. So we're working diligently with partners over there to enhance the Product Support business as we sell airplanes into it. And also, if you heard my remarks, you heard me mention Singapore as a major, basically a major maintenance overhaul hub in Asia. All of that ties together to be able to capitalize on this growing market in China. We believe it will be a very robust market, and we just want to make sure that we're measuring ourselves properly into that market so we don't, as I like to say, overdrive our headlights and risk diminishing the premier brand that we have in Gulfstream.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Access 342.
George Shapiro - Citi: My question is you had mentioned in Combat that you've got like $1.2 billion in Stryker orders, $500 million in Abrams. But the reality is, I mean, your Stryker sales are a lot above the $1.2 billion and Abrams is 2 to 3 times what you got. So how do you not have this sector go down fairly substantially over the next several years?
Jay Johnson: Say the last part again, I'm sorry.
George Shapiro - Citi: Abrams you got $500 million in orders like you said, which is probably maybe around 1/3 of what the sales are currently running. So given that Stryker and Abrams are the 2 biggest programs in this sector, how do revenues not go down substantially over the next several years?
Jay Johnson: Well, I think the numbers I gave are production numbers. And you've got in addition to that, as you know, you've got modernization, which is particularly significant in Stryker land and also will be in Abrams. You've got reset. You've got combat logistics support, which is ongoing. So there are more elements to it than just the production, I guess, is probably – it’s the safe way to say it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just want to follow up actually on that same track. Jay, you gave some good color on what's in your Combat guidance, the $9 billion for this year and what's not. And I think you only mentioned one international order that's significant that is in there and most of the rest of these things, Canadian LAV, Egyptian, Spanish, et cetera, seem to be now upside to your guidance. I just want to confirm that. And then secondly on the back of that, you said in the past that this is a business that you anticipate growing modestly from this level in future years. Is it fair to say that you do need these things to hit -- that these are really more important for next year and the year after than they are for this year anyway?
Jay Johnson: Yes, concur your last, Joe, that's exactly right. I mean, we've got a pretty good -- not pretty good, we've got very good visibility on the year, which is why I reaffirmed about $9 billion in sales. We're less dependent than we were last year on sales coming into the book. So it's a better circumstance. But you're exactly right. I mean, the order book for next year is dependent on a lot of these things -- not dependent, but these would have more impact next year than they do this year, I guess, is the way I'd say it.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And the one order you need to get this year, you mentioned it was FMS tank. Is that into the Middle East?
Jay Johnson: Yes, it is. And we're already working the front end of that, if you will, in Lima, and we anticipate a production contract later in the year. And we've got Stryker in the budget. We think, as I mentioned, we're going to get probably more Stryker. The Army wants more Stryker. We've got the double-V hull. We've got the reset on the -- not reset, sorry, the redo on the other 7 brigades that aren't double-Vs. The only -- the comment I'd make in addition to that, I mentioned in my remarks about Ground Combat Vehicle, that's one of the new development programs. So I would attach some risk to that to be pragmatic about it. But that's in the plan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Actually, I also have a Combat question, sorry, Jay. A 2-part question there, I wanted to understand what percentage of Combat sales is going to be international this year versus last year.
Jay Johnson: About the same, 23%, 24%, Heidi. That's all in, okay, FMS 2, okay?
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And then you said the force is sized correctly. But actually some of us have been talking to folks down in DC, and they want to get an update as to how many Stryker brigades you see likely ahead. I mean, is there a world given the FCS cancellation, and again, you admit that GCV could be vulnerable? Could that be filled in with more Strykers?
Jay Johnson: Well, my answer to that would be, certainly, yes. As you’d expect me to say. So I guess, I mean, honestly, you know we're deploying #8 and realistically they're looking at #9. So I guess my answer would be 9 to 12.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: I want to focus on strategy for a minute, Jay. Two things that sort of struck me. One is that you announced the sale of a small business the other day out of Combat. And then second, if we look at the environment, it's changing to a more austere world. Can you affect that change through either coming up with more competitive solutions that exist outside the normal procurement channels? I mean, the Pentagon seems to want some of that. And could you give us maybe a couple of examples of maybe how you solve the GCV as one instance, or maybe what you're doing in submarines as a second instance that sort of allow you to kind of take advantage of your incumbency and your technology?
Jay Johnson: Well, I mean, the GCV is up for technology demonstration phase, as you know within, I'd say, any day, within a month or 2. And I think that will be very telling. We believe that, that will be delivered, seen through. And then decisions on GCV would probably be made after the technology demonstration phase. So that's why it's in our plan. We believe we'll be competitive as 1 of the 3 to be selected. So it's in our plan there. And the risk attached to GCV in my view comes later on as TD phase evolves or completes. The submarine piece is very, very dynamic and very strong in my opinion. In addition to the Virginia class, and we've talked about this, that’s 18 boats of at least a 30-boat requirement. Okay? Block III, we're on 3 of 8, Block III boats in the build right now, take us out to 2018. We are looking for and working with our customer on Block III. We are also, as you know, working the FSB and the Axle higher replacement. And in that in particular, I think the word as you were alluding to, the need for innovative build strategies and solutions is going to be extremely important because you know that about 2018 to 2019 as FSB and VNX requirements build in the next decade, the Virginia class requirement does not mitigate. So there's going to be a lot to be done and the need to be innovative and creative in how you source these and how you meet the requirements is going to be ever more important.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: I had a question on Marine, and you've got great margins in Q1. But you're heading into the program transitions in this year, both at Bath and at NASSCO. Can you talk about what needs to happen there in terms of the size of the workforce and any changes in operations you're looking at? What are the things you're looking at going forward there?
Jay Johnson: At the NASSCO, okay, this will take away from your question, Doug. But Amy is my truth serum here, and I need to go back to Heidi Wood's question just for one second for all of you. As it applies to Combat international sales, I stand modestly corrected here, in that the sales actually are going to be higher this year than they were last. And I think I gave you 23 or 24. It's actually the Combat international sales will be about 28% this year. So just to set the record straight. Okay, let's talk about Bath and NASSCO. We are complete -- let's take Bath first. At Bath, we anticipate the contracts for the 2 DDG 1000s #2 and #3 ships on anytime. We're working very diligently with the customer now to bring those to closure. The DDG 1000 itself is well into the build, about 40% complete on the manufacturing. It's in the Ultra Hall facility right now and being put together. It's a beautiful, huge ship. So that's coming together. We are in the last 2 builds of DDG 51s there right now, 1 11 and 1 12 by hull number and in the '11 budget will be a contract for another DDG 51. So you're going to see DDG -- you're going to see volume up as the 1000s come in, as the next 51 comes in. And then you're going to see margins compress, as I said, because of trading the maturity as the DDG 51 program for the impact of the first of the 3 DDG 1000s at a cost plus, and then #2 and #3 will eventually come in at fixed price, and we'll readjust the margins. By that time, I should also point out, we anticipate more DDG 51s as the Navy puts into reality the ballistic missile defense block of DDG 51. So that will be a steady stream of work, albeit, there’s some work to do to smooth the flow of those ships as I just described, okay? It's probably more than you needed. But that's kind of -- that's where we are at Bath. In NASSCO, I mentioned the T-AKEs. We do magnificent work at NASSCO building those T-AKEs. We've got the last 2 to finish next year. The MLPs are coming in now, okay, and we've got the Navy -- we're working with the Navy right now, and they've put them in sequence, which is much more efficient for both the taxpayer and for us on the build. And everybody likes that. That's in stride now. So you'll see T-AKEs starting out at the end of next year. We hope to start the build on the first MLP in May. We anticipate a contract any day, okay? And then the Navy has also pulled forward the requirement for the TAOX which is the next generation of oiler into -- I think it's about 2014 now, so there's still some work to be done there. But at any rate, on the Navy side, we see longer-term good opportunity at NASSCO. The commercial side is still lagging, as I mentioned. But there’s great interest in that market, the Jones Act market. It just hasn't translated quite into contract reality yet. As a result, and this applies to all our yards, but most specifically in NASSCO right now, that's why we put out warn notices, that's why we've resized that great workforce out there to continue to manage for profitability because if we don't have the work, we won't keep the workforce at idle. So the NASSCO longer-term is very bullish in my view. But we've got some work to do right now to get MLP into reality, which will happen. We're confident of that and to return to commercial work. Remember too whenever we talk about NASSCO and the other yards, but particularly here since we're talking NASSCO, the Repair business is a significant part of their book and at least 1/4 of the top line on last year and they're the only full service yard on the West Coast, so the Navy needs their capabilities and uses it a lot. So that will continue to be a fairly significant part of the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Gleacher & Company.
Peter Arment - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Jay, I guess maybe, since no one’s asked, I guess, how are you talking about capital deployment, just in general when you look at your defense portfolio? You've got stability, some challenges, but a lot of opportunities too. How are you thinking about M&A? You've been consistently buying back stock but just maybe some broader and where the investment priorities are?
Jay Johnson: I think it's fair to say, Peter, the operative word for us as it relates to capital deployment is balance. We take a very balanced approach to it. The M&A opportunities are out there. It's been fairly dormant, shall we say, for the last 18 months as the economics went south. But there are opportunities out there. We continue to work some of those opportunities. I don't have something to announce to you today. But rest assured, we’re looking at opportunities in the Defense space, as well as in Aerospace. I mentioned in my remarks, on the Aerospace side, the global opportunity or the global footprint expansion, we see great opportunity there and expect to take advantage of it going forward. So there are M&A opportunities. We don't restrict ourselves in terms of -- we're very decentralized as you've heard me say before. I've got 13 businesses out there, each of which is tasked to continue to grow their business and look for opportunities inside their core or in adjacencies or in dual use in commercial defense, and that's exactly what they do and roll them up to us and then we make our assessments and either go or no go. The same is true on divestitures, by the way. So we look to shape our portfolio all the time, which is why you just read about us making a divestiture. That was a great book of business. But quite frankly, we didn't have the scale, and it will work better for somebody else than us. And so we don't hesitate to do something like that. We've also increased the dividend, as I mentioned. That's a significant part of our deployment, 14 years in a row. We're very much committed to dividend growth. And our share repurchase is done practically as we said and will continue to be done in that manner. So we've got pension requirements as you heard Hugh mention earlier. So it's a very balanced approach to capital deployment. But we do not believe even as a flat to declining Defense market, we do not believe there are no opportunities in Defense space, quite the contrary.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Jay, first a clarification, the size of liquidated damages in Gulfstream, were they similar to what you had in the first quarter of last year, greater or smaller? And then as a follow-up...
Jay Johnson: About the same, Myles.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, great. And then the actual question was more on how you're looking at the DDG 1001, 1002 contracts. It sounds like you're coming to final Ts and Cs there, and my guess is HII's spend had something to do with the delay. But I'm curious if there's any sticking points in respect to the Ts and Cs, how you're limiting your risk, given you're only 40% through the DDG 1000, and we're seeing some creative cost -- or some creative contract structures on these new transitions to fixed-price contracts. I'm just curious how you're setting this one up to protect on the downside.
Jay Johnson: Well, let's just say, we believe we know how to contract, and we also know how to price in risk. And so I would, at the risk of putting words in the mouth of my negotiating team, I'm sure they are attending to all of that and working it very diligently. So I think we're actually getting fairly close.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the presentation back over to Ms. Amy Gilliland for closing remarks.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2010 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Katie, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would like to now hand the call over to your host for today, Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Katie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter conference call.  As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay Johnson: Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' fourth quarter was marked by strong operating earnings and the efficient conversion of those earnings into cash. Sales on operating earnings in the quarter increased in each of our four segments from the fourth quarter of 2009. Sales were $8.6 billion, up nearly 9%, driven by 9.2% growth in our Defense businesses and 7.4% growth at Aerospace.  Operating earnings totaled nearly $1.1 billion, the first billion-dollar quarter in the company's history. Net earnings from continuing operations were $729 million or $1.91 per fully diluted share, a year-over-year improvement of 18% and 21% respectively. Disciplined execution across the company lead to a 12.5% operating margin, the best quarterly performance in 2010. For the year, sales were $32.5 billion, a modest increase over 2009, with three of our four business groups enjoying growth. Operating earnings totaled $3.95 billion in 2010, with Combat Systems and IS&T both topping $1 billion of EBIT. Aerospace lead earnings growth, delivering a nearly 22% improvement. 2010 net earnings from continuing operations were $2.6 billion or $6.82 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow, after capital expenditures, totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter, a healthy 174% of earnings from continuing operations. For the year, free cash totaled $2.6 billion or 100% of earnings from continuing operations. We deployed $1.2 billion of that cash to repurchase 18.9 million of our shares, including 7.8 million shares in the fourth quarter. Through both share repurchases and dividends, we returned 69% of free cash to shareholders in 2010. Total company orders in the fourth quarter were $6.6 billion. Our order book included somewhat lighter Defense bookings in line with our expectations, and the Aerospace segment's best quarterly intake since the third quarter of 2008. For the full year, Defense orders were 9% better than 2009, and our aggregate Defense book-to-bill improved. General Dynamics finished 2010 with a total backlog of $59.6 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts, totaled $81.3 billion.  I'd now like to focus on the performance and outlook for each of our businesses, starting with our three defense groups.  First, let's talk about Combat. Combat Systems enjoyed a robust fourth quarter, as each of the groups' four businesses delivered their largest sales and earnings results of the year. Sales were nearly $2.7 billion, 8.4% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009 and 30% higher than the prior quarter. Earnings were $400 million in the fourth quarter. This represents 9% growth from last year's fourth quarter and nearly 29% growth from the third quarter. Margins were 14.8%, reflecting excellent manufacturing performance and program management. For the year, the group's sales were $8.9 billion. This represents a decline in sales from last year, the result of lower volume at our U.S. and European Vehicle businesses. More than 2/3 of this contraction resulted from less MRAP vehicle volume and lower U.S. engineering development work due primarily to the cancellation of the Army's future combat systems program and less activity on the Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle. Cost reduction and productivity improvements enabled Combat Systems to maintain operating earnings at nearly $1.3 billion despite the year's decline in sales. Margins were 14.4%, 130 basis points higher than 2009 due to excellent execution and a higher percentage of mature program volume relative to engineering and development work. Year end, total potential contract value for Combat Systems was $16.5 billion, including $11.8 billion in backlog and $4.6 billion of unexercised options and IDIQ contracts. Those IDIQ contracts include two notable additions in 2010: the Hydra Rocket award; and the United Kingdom's Scout Specialist Vehicle program which has already entered development. Notable U.S. orders in the fourth quarter included approximately $600 million for Stryker and Abrams production, modernization and logistics support and $350 million for RG-31 MRAP upgrades. Fourth quarter international awards were also healthy and included EAGLE wheel vehicles, FMS LAVs [Foreign Military Sales Light Armored Vehicles] and tank upgrades. Subsequent to the quarter, we received funding to produce Namer tank hulls for the Israeli Ministry of Defense. We anticipate receiving several additional international vehicle awards in the first half of 2011, including production funding for FMS tanks and the Canadian LAV upgrade program.  For 2011, I expect Combat Systems to deliver around $9 billion in sales, reflecting stability in our European Vehicle, Weapons and Munitions businesses and modest growth in our Land Systems business. This growth will be driven by several international programs, including two FMS LAV programs now in production, initial production on an FMS tank program and the Canadian LAV upgrade program. Expect operating margins around 14%, consistent with 2010. Next, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group finished another productive year with a superb quarter. Quarterly sales totaled $1.7 billion, a near 10% increase over 2009, while operating earnings increased 13.5% to $177 million. This quarter's double-digit sales and earnings growth is particularly impressive since the same quarter a year ago saw sales and earnings growth 12.4% and 18.2% respectively when compared with 2008.  Incremental Virginia-class submarine volume and SSBN replacement design work drove the top line growth, while increased submarine volume and higher booking rates on our auxiliary and commercial ship programs drove the earnings improvement. The group's 10.4% margins were up 30 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year, sales and earnings each grew 5%, and the group had a 10.1% operating margin. This industry-leading, double-digit margin demonstrates the group's continued commitment to manufacturing excellence and to managing for profitably, particularly important as we begin to encounter mix shift in our program workload. Marine's year-end backlog totaled $20.1 billion. We anticipate adding several additional Navy ships to backlog in 2011, including two additional Zumwalt Class destroyers, DDGs 1001 and 1002, another DDG 51 destroyer, part of the Arleigh Burke restart program, and the first MLP mobile landing platform. In addition to our Navy work, we continue to see interest across the range of commercial shippers and believe that we will leverage our product carrier's success to win new commercial work this year. For the year ahead, Marine Systems will be challenged to maintain sales due to delays in receiving several contracts. Over the long term, however, the group's outlook remains very robust and includes commercial opportunities; the next block, block four, of Virginia-class submarines; the SSBN replacement program; additional DDG 51s and a new program to replace the Navy's aging class of boilers.  Our Navy customer's commitment to these programs was evident in the fourth quarter, as Electric Boat received an award for additional SSBN missile compartment design work, and the Department of Defense approved milestone B for the DDG 1000 program, enabling Bath Iron Works to continue production of DDG 1000 and 1001 and to begin work on 1002.  Additionally, the Secretary of Defense announced the Navy's decision to reinvest efficiency savings into increasing the planned procurement of DDG 51s over the next five years and accelerating the fleet boiler replacement program. In 2011, margins should be in the low 9% range as the group experiences more significant mix shift in its surface combatant workload. Moving to IS&T. IS&T finished the year with fourth quarter sales at $2.9 billion. This 9.6% increase over the same quarter last year was driven primarily by increased volume on IT modernization programs for a variety of government customers. IS&T's fourth quarter earnings were $311 million. Each of the groups' four businesses contributed to this 10.3% earnings improvement over last year's fourth quarter. The group's margins increased 10 basis points to 10.6%.  IS&T sales grew 7.5% in 2010, while operating earnings grew 5.9%. Organic sales growth was nearly 6%. The group's full year margin rate was 10.5%, in line with my expectations. I am extremely pleased with the ability of our IS&T segment to deliver this healthy double-digit margin, given their growing IT service workload in highly competitive, fast-moving markets. Demand for products across the group's portfolio continued. Given IS&T's particularly strong order activity in the first three quarters, orders were comparatively lighter in the fourth quarter. I should note that IS&T's fourth quarter order activity is historically somewhat lighter than other quarters in the year. For the full year, book-to-bill was approximately one time again. Year-end backlog totaled $9.8 billion. The group's estimated potential contract value, which consists of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options, grew approximately 19% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and 9% from last quarter.  Growth in IS&T's estimated potential contract value is a particularly important metric, as it provides around 35% to 40% of the group's orders each year. Notable contracts in this category in the fourth quarter included a contract to provide the combat and C-frame control systems for Littoral Combat Ships and a contract covering low rate initial production activities for the Army's WIN-T tactical communications network. The group's year-end total potential contract value, which includes backlog and estimated potential contract value, totaled $25 billion, an increase from both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2010. This robust opportunity set positions IS&T for another successful year in 2011. Sales growth in 2011 should be between 3% and 5%, while margins will be in the low- to mid-10% range. Before discussing our Aerospace group, let me comment briefly on our Defense outlook. Fourth quarter and full-year results for our three defense groups demonstrate the stability and earnings power of our Defense portfolio. Execution is paramount, and we remain committed to maximizing profitability. In a challenging defense environment, that means cutting unnecessary costs to ensure the affordability of our products, continuously improving our operations to drive earnings growth and if warranted, reshaping our businesses to better align with today's market environment. We are certainly aware of the current Washington focus on debt and budget reduction. Defense is a major element of discretionary funding and will be on the table during the FY 2012 Congressional budget process.  Secretary Gates has done a good job of framing the spending needs of the Department of Defense and initiating an efficiency agenda to get more procurement out of the Pentagon's top line. In a tight budgetary environment, Secretary Gates has reiterated the importance of increased investments in proven capabilities relevant to current and future threats. In so doing, he recently announced the cancellation of several developmental programs, including our Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle. This cancellation, which was well telegraphed over the last six months, is not a reflection of the quality or performance of our prototype vehicles which are doing extremely well in ongoing testing. This cancellation, while disappointing, will not have a material impact this year. And given our experience in developing EFV, we remain well positioned to participate in whatever comes next to fulfill this mission requirement for the United States Marine Corps. The real-world defense mission that the U.S. is carrying out right now, foreign wars on terror, pacing peer competitors and fronting regional nuclear proliferation and ensuring global economic access, are all limits on how much the defense budget can be reduced. The defense industrial base is also a key part of the U.S. economy, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs nationally. Even so, we assume defense spending will be essentially flat over the next five years. That will still be more than $100 billion in annual procurement in constant dollars.  We feel confident about our defense portfolio in this environment. Our facilities are key parts of the defense industrial base, which must be maintained. We have solid incumbency in the Army and Navy force structures with Stryker combat vehicles, Abrams tanks, the Army tactical communications network, Virginia-class submarines and DDG 51 and DDG 1000 destroyers. With fewer new programs, incumbent platforms and programs will require continued production and modernization. General Dynamics is also a major provider of cyber warfare-related products and services, an area where we believe spending will increase. So even as we operate under a continuing resolution at 2010 Defense funding levels and await the final congressional disposition of FY '11, we look to the FY 2012 budget process with realism and a prudent operating plan. Now let's move to our primary growth segment, Aerospace. The Aerospace group finished the year in the excellent manner we have come to expect. Order highlights included further earnings and margin growth, strong order activity, minimal customer defaults and backlog growth. Fourth quarter sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 7.4% when compared to fourth quarter 2009 due to several additional Gulfstream completions and improved service workload. Sequentially, sales were down modestly due to fewer mid-cap and green deliveries and less pre-owned activity.  The Aerospace segment's operating earnings were $210 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 16.6% operating margin. The group's operating earnings and margin improved from both fourth quarter 2009 and third quarter 2010. Improved large cabin pricing drove margin improvement in both periods, while the sequential comparison was also helped by the delivery of fewer mid-cabin aircraft. For the year, sales were $5.3 billion, up 2.5%. The group's top line growth was primarily driven by improved service activity at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. Double-digit operating earnings growth in 2010 resulted in $860 million of earnings, as Aerospace margins expanded 250 basis points to end the year at 16.2%. Excellent execution, improved new aircraft and service pricing and the absence of pre-owned aircraft losses were the primary drivers behind the group's increased probability last year. The key metrics that provide insight into the health of the business jet market reflected continued improvement in the fourth quarter. Aircraft utilization remained robust, and our service centers in North America and around the world enjoyed another very good quarter. For the year, our service business was up nearly 14%. We are committed to ensuring that our service business remains best in class and that it grows in lock step with our international customer base. Pre-owned inventory levels for both large- and mid-cabin aircraft continued to show some improvement over the last several months of 2010. We have no pre-owned aircraft in inventory at the end of the year. For the year, we made a modest profit on just over $100 million in sales on seven pre-owned aircraft. That compares favorably to the losses we realized on the sale of six pre-owned aircraft in 2009.  Fourth quarter orders outpaced deliveries, as net orders reached their highest level since the downturn began and defaults remained at low levels. Gulfstream new aircraft book-to-bill was 1.5x on a dollar-denominated basis, causing backlog to increase $244 million to $17.8 billion. 2010 orders were over 60% international, reflecting a diversified regional customer base. These orders continued to come primarily from privately held companies and individuals, although we were pleased to see Fortune 500 companies return to the market this year and gain share in our order book. Fourth quarter orders included each of our business jet models, as both large- and mid-cabin orders were the strongest of the year. Given the strength of order activity in the fourth quarter and new customer interest, we plan to deliver approximately 90 large-cabin green aircraft in 2011, including 78 G550s and 450s, slightly above our 2010 production levels and about a dozen G650s. Mid-sized green deliveries will be around 15 to 20 aircraft and will include several G250s. Given the steady improvement that we've witnessed in the mid-cabin market in recent months, we remain flexible and have the ability to increase deliveries if and when customer demand warrants doing so. We continue to be extremely pleased with our product development efforts. Both the G250 and G650 remain on track to achieve FAA, EASA certification this year. In the fourth quarter, the G250 made its first transatlantic voyage, surpassed 600 hours of flight testing and completed a series of important milestone tests in the U.S. before returning to Israel. The G650 has also surpassed several key milestones in recent months including flying 5,000 miles at 0.9 mock, surpassing 1,100 hours of flight testing and adding a fifth test article to the flight program. 2011 promises to be another busy and successful year for both programs, as we prepare to add these aircraft to our Gulfstream fleet.  Our commitment to innovation and product development remains steadfast. In anticipation of continued growth in the global business aviation market, we recently announced the expansion of our Savanna campus through a $500 million seven-year plan. This investment is critical, as it will ensure that Gulfstream is well positioned to remain the market leader. In 2011, the Aerospace group will enjoy double-digit growth, likely 15% to 16%, with margins in the mid- to high-15% range.  In conclusion, General Dynamics delivered another solid performance in 2010. The company is well positioned for continued success in 2011, driven by the stability and diversity of our defense portfolio and double-digit growth in our Aerospace segment, fueled by new product introduction and further recovery of the business aviation market.  The segment guidance I provided this morning implies total earnings per share from continuing operations in a range between $7 and $7.10. As is our normal pattern, we expect EPS to grow progressively throughout the year. Growth, when compared with 2010 quarterly EPS results, will come primarily in the second half. I should also highlight that my guidance is operational and does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment. Our strong balance sheet and excellent cash outlook, however, afford us significant flexibility in this area. As we hit the deck running in 2011, we remain focused on executing on our backlog and continuing to identify opportunities that will create the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?
L. Redd: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. You can see in Exhibit E to our press release that we finished 2010 with just over $2.6 billion in cash which, when added to our marketable securities, resulted in a net debt balance at the end of the year of just under $400 million. This is down almost $800 million from last quarter and $850 million from 2009. As a result, interest expense in the fourth quarter was down 23% from a year ago. We expect interest expense for the full year 2011 to decline to around $135 million. That's due largely to the $700 million debt repayment we made in the third quarter and is also based on the assumption that we will not roll the $750 million of fixed-rate notes which become due next July. Obviously, we will make the decision to refinance the notes or retire them with cash on hand when we get closer to the due date. Moving on to the income taxes. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 30.1%, obviously below our previous expectation of 31.2%. The reduction was due largely to the late year. In fact, entirely to the late year extension of the Army tax credit. This lowered our full year tax rate by 26 basis points, but reduced the fourth quarter rate by just over one full percentage point. We expect the 2011 full year tax rate to be 31% at the high end and probably some opportunity to outperform that mark. But with respect to corporate operating expense, which is primarily stock option expense, we're projecting a 2011 number between $90 million and $95 million.  Finally, a quick note on pension contributions. We're planning to make a voluntary contribution of approximately $350 million to our pension plans in 2011, and that's slightly larger than our 2010 contribution.  That completes my remarks. And Amy, I'll turn the time back to you for the Q&A.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Katie, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Jay, could you address, specifically, does your guidance incorporate the potential for a full year continuing resolution or even maybe something worse than that in fiscal '11? And how do you see that, if that's the scenario we get, how would that potentially impact the business?
Jay Johnson: The direct answer to your question, David, is no, it does not anticipate the full year CR or really even a modified CR of any kind. But I would tell you and I would opine that if you did have a full year CR indeed, there would be impact, which I'm not going to try to quantify right now. The important note I would put forward though is that in the CR environment we are dealing with right now, there are programs that would be affected should the CR continue. Significant programs, Virginia class to a year, for example, is one. But in every instance, I would tell you that the customer and our folks are front and center working these with all invested stakeholders so that it's not passing by anyone's scan that we've got a deal with these as they're presented one at the time. So it's getting the attention it deserves. It's a different way of doing it, but we're working hand-in-glove with the customers to make sure that we come to a satisfactory outcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG: Sort of on the heels of that last question, Jay. You did talk about pressure on Defense budgets before. How would you classify the risk at GD by segment? And directionally, how should backlog move over the course of next year or so in each segment? And I'm focusing on the Defense side here.
Jay Johnson: Well, you know, Rob, let me put it this way. You know that the Marine group, and I talked about this, the Marine group is very lumpy in terms of its backlog. It comes in big slugs. We work off the slug for a number of years, it comes in other big slugs. I mean that that's the most lumpy of any of our defense groups. And you heard me mention also that we had contract delays in significant programs, which are reflecting in the backlog that we see right now: the DDG 1000, the DDG 115, 51, 115 by a whole number and MLP, et cetera. So that lumpiness is just the reality, and we're working off the last big inject right now. So you'll see that come back to us, I would expect, starting this year. The Combat Systems group is kind of less lumpy, but it depends. The vehicle, the platform business tends to be a little bit lumpy and that runs year plus backlog injects. The weapon systems and ammunition and guns business tends to be kind of year-by-year. And then of course, in IS&T space, it's all very active inside the year loop as I think I mentioned in my remarks. And they did a very good job this year of getting themselves essentially 1x in their backlog for 2010. So I don't know if that's totally responsive to your question. But the backlog, I would tell you that the way I describe my feeling about our Defense backlog is I'm very watchful, okay, and very attentive to it. Am I concerned about it? Not right now.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG: Well see, Jay, this is why asked about it. Sort of a couple of your framework, knowing that it's volatile, looking at Marine going from $9 billion and change the beginning of '10 after the first quarter down to $7 billion now, we know you've been eroding on -- having not gotten the new orders in. But even if you have a CR for the rest of this year, assuming everything comes back in the fiscal '12 budget, at two years from today, would you say Marine's got higher or lower backlog? And the same question on the other two segments.
Jay Johnson: Two years from today, I'm not prepared to answer the question. But I would tell you, I mean, if you look at Marine by itself here, I've already mentioned the major platforms that are being dealt with as we speak. Those will come into backlog, I believe, this year. They're being worked as one offs as I've mentioned before even with the CR. So they were delayed largely because of, in our view, I believe, the incredible workload of the program offers inside the Pentagon as they redid the LCS strategy and now that, that has been delivered, we're working very diligently with our customer on both the DDG 1001 and 1002 and the 115 and the MLP contracts. So we're getting inject back into that backlog this year. In two more years, what it will look like? Well, I'm not going to get speculative, but I mentioned in my remarks that we've got another block of Virginia class submarines coming, which will certainly be nontrivial in terms of backlog. That was the huge inject the last time we had a backlog. So we've got that, we've got SSBN development work, et cetera. So you're going to see increase in the Marine backlog as we go forward. Combat is probably, honestly, going to be down a bit, flat to down, not unexpected on the U.S. domestic side. On the international side, I think we're going to see growth there. We are seeing growth there, and I believe that, that will continue. IS&T should be good on their backlog, flat to a little nose up perhaps. But as I said, that's usually inside the year, and it refreshes itself annually. So that's probably more than you wanted, but that's where...
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays Capital.
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: The first Gulfstream question. I wonder if you might talk a bit to the backlog growth and how it may break out between the 650 and 450, 550 and midsize and how that's driving production decisions when you look beyond '11. And within that, can you address in more descript terms, what you're thinking about the 650 production plan beyond 33 a year as we look well out on the horizon?
Jay Johnson: The backlog is really being enhanced by all -- by the large cabin, obviously, all three of the large-cabin aircraft and the mid cabin. So a pretty good spread there, Carter. We're still taking orders for 650s, okay. The 550, 450 book, you've heard me talk about the 18- to 24-month backlog sweet spot, okay? We're in the sweet spot, looking good. I feel very confident about that, and we're taking mid-cabin orders. That activity continues to grow, I think is probably an accurate term. It's not what I'd call robust, but it's clearly coming back and we're getting more activity as we go month by month and we're taking orders for 250s, we're taking orders for 200s, and so I see that in very optimistic terms. The number I gave you, the production numbers I gave you for green deliveries are consistent on the large-cabin in production 450, 550 with I think what I've been signaling pretty much throughout the year, based on looking at that 18- to 24-month backlog. We feel pretty really good about that. And the mid cabin, 15 to 20, give me a little upside there. We anticipate, I think, that probably that market may return, but I'm giving you kind of a conservative number there and we'll see how it goes. But every indication we have in the mid-cabin is that, and I think you may hear this from some of the other OEMs, that the mid-cabin market is coming back. So as it applies to the 650, and I know you know very well my numbers on '12, '13 and '14 in terms of completions, that 17, 33 and 33, I'm going to stick with those numbers right now. But we're going to turn out about a dozen 650 greens as I mentioned in 2011. And you can probably add 10 or so a year to that to deliver those completions that I just described. And then as we get closer to full production here, we'll wick it up and anticipate being able to do so, but I'm just not ready to write that check yet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Staying on Gulfstream. Could you comment on the G650 in terms of margin? And what I'm getting at is should we expect in the early stages of production that this would be somewhat dilutive to margin? And if so, when would you expect that to turn the corner and be helpful to margin?
Jay Johnson: Well, I would characterize it this way, Doug. On the initial blush, I would characterize it as dilutive to large-cabin, new aircraft margin, okay, because it's brand, spanking new. And we're going to -- anyway, you understand that. But as I've said repeatedly, as we hit stride with that airplane and look at the purpose-built facility we've got, the design for manufacturing that's existent within that platform, those margins will grow handsomely, and I expect them to be the margin setters for Gulfstream, pace setters for Gulfstream. When that will occur, I can't tell you, but I would expect continuous improvement as we go. We're very bullish on the 650 as you probably can tell and are very excited about getting it operational.
Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: But you can't give a sense of when you may be able to at least hit the margins that you're getting on the 450 and 550? Sort of what timeframe?
Jay Johnson: No, I mean it will be several years, but I'm not going to try to pin it down. Joe Lombardo would be mad at me if I tried.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: What is exactly the Marine sales guidance? I think I might have missed it.
Jay Johnson: Essentially, it's flat. The way I characterize it, I said, they're going to be challenged to maintain their sales this year. And Myles, it's strictly a function of timing on those contract delays.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: And then given the comments on the flat outlook for Defense spending, which you see in the backdrop, is this the environment where, Jay, you think it's more important to be opportunistic in buying defense properties that might otherwise be under-distressed or certainly a negative sentiment overhang? Or are you more inclined to say, "You know what, I have a commercial entity. I'd like to increase the scale and/or buy my own shares."
Jay Johnson: Well, I mean I think you know, Myles, we look at all of that. And I haven't changed my direction to any of the business unit presidents out there, the 13 of them that within your sphere of business look for opportunities to grow that business with acquisitions, be it core, additive core, which I believe in this Defense environment, there will be opportunities that come available, and adjacency and/or dual use or commercial. You bet. We're looking at all of those things. And then in addition to that, of course, we have the Aerospace growth engine that we intend to take advantage of.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: But just to clarify, is there anything in that environment that could change to make you change that thinking?
Jay Johnson: I can't think of anything off the top of my head. But I mean our Defense portfolio, you hear me say it repeatedly, one of the great strengths of our defense portfolio is that it's very diverse. And so it gives us lots of opportunities, and we've got ups in some places and downs in other places, and we constantly assess how each portion of our portfolio is performing. And we'll grow some of them. And dare say we'll probably divest some pieces of it as we did, for example, with Spectrum Astro last year. If it's better for somebody else than it is for us, we're not afraid to divest. So we shape the portfolio as we go.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Gleacher & Company.
Peter Arment - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Question on your European and back to Combat Systems on European Land Systems. We came into 2010 with, I think, with a number different contracts. And I think particularly the Spanish 8x8 that kind of you had to move to the right. Could you just maybe just give us a little bit of some color on -- you mentioned that you are expecting to see some stability here. How are these contracts looking right now? And is there anything that still needs to be signed up going for this year?
Jay Johnson: I think the way I'd characterize it, Peter, is that it's still very active. There are still some soft spots in all of this. And I have no false expectations that some of the things won't continue to move to the right. But by and large, the European order book, both indigenous order book and the FMS export order book, are quite handsome, I believe. We've got the Canadian LAV, which I mentioned in my remarks, which is very active. We expect the production contract anytime here in 2011. You got the TAPV, you've got the CCV programs after that, that we're very competitive for. You got the Scout SV Specialist Vehicle in the U.K. We're in development right now on a $750 million contract. So that is proceeding a pace, and it will be years in stride with every indication that it's going to proceed per original intent. The Spanish 8x8 that you mentioned, the VBR, the Spanish government ministry is still working very diligently, given their circumstance, still working very diligently to bring that thing to contract this year. That's about the best I can say. They've been very consistent in that. Will it happen? We'll see. But they're certainly committed to making it happen as best they can. So we've got orders in Switzerland for platforms, dura platforms. We've got orders in Germany for EAGLEs, and the EAGLE just keeps getting better and better as it goes and more order activity around that. And then you move into the FMS work with our FMS customers, and you got two huge LAV orders that are already in play. You've got an FMS tank order in excess of $1 billion that's in play and will go into production this year, I believe. You've got the Iraqi tank order that we're already delivering to the Iraqis, and so it goes. I mean -- so it's very active. And I mentioned in my remarks, the Namer for the Israeli Ministry of Defense that we're working with them on right now at about I think a $300 million contract. So the international book will continue to be very active. There'll be puts and takes, I think, as I mentioned earlier because of budget realities in other countries. But the long term and the integrity of that book, I think, is very solid.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: So what you're saying, I mean the $9 billion, I think your guidance, $9 billion, for this year, it sounds actually, and it kind of relates to, I think Rob's question, looking out over the next year or two, this is quite a sustainable business just given all that activity you ticked off?
Jay Johnson: Yes. And I think you've heard me say it before, Peter, but I got my head around right now, this being a $9 billion business, plus or minus a little, and that's kind of what the way we're seeing it right now. That's the way 2011 looks to us. 2012 is not quite as clear just because of where we are in the budget process, but the going in position looks pretty good. So we'll see how it plays out. But I don't see any drastic motion, frankly, down or up, in Combat Systems right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: Just a quick question on the EFV. Given what you know about the mission and combine that perhaps with what the Secretary has said publicly about the program and then maybe what the program office has told you about our amphibious capabilities going forward, what do you envision the next potential program looking like? And how is it that General Dynamics may be able to step in and fill that need?
Jay Johnson: That's probably a question to ask the Marine Corps. But honestly, I mean we believe the expeditionary fighting vehicle satisfies the requirement nicely. Decisions have been taken that said it's unaffordable, it's not a quality thing, it's unaffordable. We are working to make that program either wind down or reshape. We're being very responsive to lots of people's questions as you might answer. But I would to say this: how it ends up, I don't know, but whatever happens, and I alluded to this in my remarks, we are well positioned to compete or provide whatever the Marine Corps needs to satisfy that amphibious requirement in whatever dimension it's presented in final form. I think that's the fairest way to say it. It's always been and remains a strategic mission decision on the basis of the United States Marine Corps in the 21st century. And if they need an amphibious capability of whatever proportion, we believe, based on our experience in EFV and building lots of things that go on and under the water, that we can compete quite handsomely for that and intend to do so.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Jay, I wanted to ask a question on the Marine segment. And just as things have been pushed out on some of these orders, whether it's DDG 1001 or 1002 or even the DDG 51s, just thinking about that in particular, how far out do these get pushed it somehow causes you to make some changes to your cost structure? And in terms of just what your long-term profitability in those contracts are, does that get shifted out as well with that timing?
Jay Johnson: Well, to a point, Sam. But as you know, we're very disciplined in our ability to maintain profitability at our shipyards. So if the contracts delay much longer, there's no doubt about the fact that we'll have to reshape our business up there to deal with that. We did it in NASSCO because we've got a valley, if you will, in the order book coming out there. We'll do the same thing at Bath if we have to, without question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Jay, just an observation. Generally in the January call, you gave us the EPS breakdown for the year. Are you not doing that now because of the continuing resolution?
Jay Johnson: You mean the $7 to $7.10?
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Yes. You usually give us a sense of what the spread is across the four quarters?
Jay Johnson: No. Well, I don't remember doing that.
Amy Gilliland: Heidi, I think we just generally usually try to give you a sense of how it's going to play out in the year. And you might've missed his remarks but right at the end, Jay did comment that in the second half of the year, that's where most of the EPS growth over 2010 will be. So it will get bigger each quarter with the second half being the largest.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: And then Jay, you've got the sense, a very strong balance sheet and in light of the value of the company, what's preventing you from being bolder on share repurchase?
Jay Johnson: Well, I don't consider 18.9 million shares to be trivial. But we're opportunistic not programmatic in our share repurchase segment activity. And when the market suggests that we're undervalued and ought to buy it back, if that's the best use of the cash, we'll do it. But as you know, and I think we've talked before, Heidi, in terms of capital deployment, we've held back just because of the environment in which we've been operating to make sure we have plenty of cash. We have plenty of cash. I think you could expect now that the environment is improving to see us execute our balance preference in terms of how we deploy our capital to include more acquisitions and continue share repurchase as the market talks to us. So we'll deal with the dividend in March as we always do. We'll deal with share repurchases as it becomes opportunistic for us. And we're looking and working the M&A side very actively right now.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: You're right, 18.9 million is a lot, but from '09 to '10, the net decline was only 7 million. That's why I'm wondering whether you've got a determination to kind of keep chewing that down, that's what I was trying to say.
Jay Johnson: Yes, we'll keep chewing it down as long as it makes sense to do so. But we're also about growing earnings around here. And so the capital deployment is going to be helping us tie to that very nicely.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: And then lastly, can you talk about slot availability in 2011? And there's a considerable debate, as you're well aware, about whether the G550 gets cannibalized by the 650. Can you give us any color advancing that debate one way or the other as you look out with the demand over the second half of 2010 and early inquiries into 2011?
Jay Johnson: Yes. We have 18 to 24 months backlog in both the in-production, large-cabin aircraft. There is not cannibalization occurring. We're still taking orders for 650s. We're well out on 550s and 450s. We're very pleased with all of that. I do not see cannibalization as an issue. We're holding price very handsomely on the large cabins. So the 650 is not a replacement, as you know, Heidi, but for everyone, is not a replacement for any aircraft. It defines its own part at the top of the market. And that's exactly the way it's being presented and that's exactly the way it's being received. So it's not threatening at all to our 550 in terms of backlog or activity at all.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: And then just to reiterate, the 550 slots are full in '11?
Jay Johnson: That is correct.
Amy Gilliland: And Katie, I think we have time for just one more question this afternoon.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Jay, maybe looking at the OCO leaks to the FY '12 number suggests the administration is going to bring the OCO down quite considerably. I was wondering if you could clarify what your exposure still is there and whether you would see any negative impact from that.
Jay Johnson: I think the general answer there would be not much. I mean in years past, I think as you know, the OCO, the supplementals, et cetera, included procurement, included MRAP, included things that were very elemental to us. But in the past few years, what we're seeing is really the best way to say it, I think, is our core programs have moved into the base budget, by and large, okay? So it's not something that is going to change our life much if the OCO comes down. That's probably the best way to say it.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: If you could give an estimate of the percentage of sales maybe in 2011?
Jay Johnson: No, very small. I don't have a number in my head, but it's not -- let's put it this way, it's not something I worry about.
Operator: At this time, I'd like to hand the call back over to Amy Gilliland for closing remarks.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you for joining our call today. And if you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703)876-3748. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation in today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2010 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Derek and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter Conference Call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay Johnson: Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered another solid operating performance in the third quarter with sales of $8 billion nearly 4% better than the same quarter a year ago. Operating earnings of $966 million were up 10.5% over the year-ago quarter. Company margins improved 80 basis points to 12.1%. Earnings per share were $1.70 on a fully diluted basis, $0.22 better than last year's third quarter. Third quarter free cash flow, after capital expenditures, was $784 million, 121% of earnings from continuing operations. This includes a voluntary payment of $270 million to our pension plan. In terms of capital deployment, we used $700 million in the quarter to retire our 4.5% fixed rate notes. We also purchased 2.7 million shares of General Dynamics' stock in the open market for $163 million. Year-to-date, we have spent $726 million to repurchase 11.2 million shares. Through share repurchases and dividends, we have returned almost 90% of year-to-date free cash flow to shareholders. Third quarter orders were the strongest we've seen this year. Aerospace and IS&T's book to bill exceeded 1:1 while Combat's book to bill was nearly 1:1. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at a robust $61.8 billion. Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, starting with the largest of our four businesses, IS&T. IS&T enjoyed strong orders, sales, earnings and margins in the third quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion for the second consecutive quarter, an 8% increase over last year's third quarter. This is healthy growth in light of the fact that last year's third quarter was the group's highest sales quarter in 2009. Year-to-date, sales are up 7%. The group's third quarter earnings were $306 million up 3.4% year-over-year. Operating margins were 10.4% in the quarter, essentially in line with my 10.5% full year guidance. The group's book to bill exceeded 1x for the third consecutive quarter causing backlog to increase by $230 million. If the group maintains this win rate, as I expect, 2010 will stand as the 12th year that book-to-bill has been at or above 1x, an excellent track record for a business of this size and diversity. Award activity in the quarter was particularly strong at our tactical communications and IT services businesses. Several of these contracts are detailed in today's earnings press release. Total estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog, stood at $24.9 billion at quarter-end. This represents well over 2x expected 2011 sales and a 5% increase above the year-ago value. Fourth quarter sales and margins will be essentially in line with the third quarter. For the full year, I expect group sales to increase approximately 8% to 8.5% over last year driven by double-digit sales growth in our Tactical Communications and Information Technology Services businesses. Margins for the year will remain around 10.5%. As we look to the future, IS&T is particularly well positioned. I want to spend a few minutes this morning giving you a sense for why. First, a few facts that highlight the group's diverse business base. Group sales are derived from thousands of contracts at any given time with no single contract totaling more than 2% of company sales. Approximately 40% of sales come from civil agencies, restricted, commercial and international customers. Product and systems integration dominate the group's efforts, representing over 50% of sales. The remaining sales consist of approximately 25% high-end engineering services and 20% pure IT service work. Nearly half of sales result from fixed price contracts while approximately 38% are cost plus and the remainder, time and materials. Over the past decade, we have evolved the group's products and services offerings into a balanced portfolio that remains at the forefront of Defense and Federal spending priorities. Let me briefly review the three key pieces of this business. First, Tactical Communications and Battle Space Management. This segment represents approximately only 45% of the group's sales and comprises a U.S. and a smaller U.K.-based business. The group's products and services provide critical command and control capability and enables secure, continuous communications all the way to the dismounted soldier. Programs include the Army's battlefield network, known as WIN-T and the new handheld software defined Joint Tactical Radio System unknown as JTRS HMS. We have dramatically diversified our overseas C4 business from a purely U.K.-based avionics house to a provider of vehicles, force protection, security, avionics and C4I products to a global clientele. Earlier this year, GD U.K. was awarded the development contract for the British Army scout reconnaissance vehicle. This program remains a top funding priority and was included as a component of the Army's future land forces in the U.K.'s recent strategic defense and security review. Next, Information Technology and Mission Services. Our IT services unit comprises a little over 1/3 of the group's sales. This business enjoys excellent market positions in the Defense Department and the intelligence community as a provider of IT infrastructure, simulation and training services and key mission support. This business also provides an array of IT Healthcare Services to military, federal and commercial customers. And finally, Intelligence, Surveillance And Reconnaissance, ISR systems. Comprising about 20% of IS&T sales, this business specializes in signals intelligence, tactical imagery and information collection, processing, exploitation and distribution. In 2009, as many of you know, we added Access to this unit. As a best in class supplier of high-performance electrical optical and infrared sensors and systems, Access provides sensor components that enhance the ability of war fighters and government agencies alike to provide timely, actionable intelligence. Although not a designated business unit within IS&T, Cyber security encompasses core capabilities resident in each of our businesses including encryption and information assurance, network security and forensics. General Dynamics is a market leader in the cyber arena with approximately $2 billion in 2009 sales across a diversed customer base, including the Pentagon, homeland security and the commercial markets. As prime contractor on many sophisticated national Cyber security programs, we employ more than 50% of U.S. cleared digital forensics investigators. Government agencies and private corporations alike will spend billions to protect and defend their networks in the years ahead. General Dynamics will be a major part of that fast-growing market. The IS&T group, by leveraging its current capabilities to capture new business in faster growing market segments, has the opportunity to deliver steady growth over the next several years. Each of the group's businesses remain focused on maintaining their competitive edge by aggressively cutting costs, encouraging continues improvement initiatives and selectively pursuing those opportunities that offer the most attractive returns. Combat Systems. Combat Systems sales were $2.1 billion in the third quarter. This result represented less volume than the year-ago quarter primarily in vehicle modifications, combat logistic support and development programs. Year-to-date, over 50% of the group's sales decline is related to last MRAP volume and less engineering work which is largely the result of the cancellation of future Combat Systems. Despite a reduction in sales, earnings were essentially flat with last year's third quarter as margins expanded in several of our businesses. The 150 basis point year-over-year margin improvement is the result of strong operating performance and less engineering and development content. Total backlog for Combat Systems was essentially unchanged from second quarter at $12.8 billion. Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $475 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $80 million for Iraqi tank logistic support, $260 million for reactive armor, guns and biological detection systems and a $120 million award to supply ammunition to the Canadian Armed Forces. Because of the success of Stryker double-V hull testing, we received another series of orders for the new hulls subsequent to the quarter. Double-V modifications of the current Stryker fleet remain another promising opportunity. We were also notified earlier this month that our U.S. Vehicle business was selected to negotiate a contract to produce Merkava APC main hulls and kits for the Israeli government. We expect to add this program to backlog in the first half of next year and we'll deliver these hulls over the next overall years. We made progress on several international programs in the quarter delivering the first of 140 Iraqi tanks, finalizing preparations for FMS LAV productions and progressing through Canadian LAV upgrade engineering work. Despite these progress, international sales are coming more slowly than anticipated but should grow more significantly in 2011. Consistent with my earlier report, a number of international programs have been slowed by their country's financial status, but none have been canceled or withdrawn. Combat expects to book several additional international orders in the fourth quarter including an FMS LAV order totaling $250 million, the first production contract for an FMS tank upgrade program totaling $300 million and a $100 million order for German EAGLE vehicles. In the first half of 2011, we expect to add the first tranche of production funding for the $850 million Canadian LAV upgrade program to the backlog. The pacing of U.S. awards has also lagged our expectations this year. Some of the awards expected in the first half including armor and biological detection systems came late in the third quarter and will result in lower sales than previously expected in 2010. Other program awards, most notably the ground combat vehicle competition, will push out until 2011. Looking forward for the group, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest by far. For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be around $9 billion. My expectation for the group's full-year earnings remain unchanged. Margins, therefore, will be around 14%, 40 to 50 basis points higher than my prior guidance. This margin performance is the result of strong operational execution in the first nine months of the year and a favorable program mix that includes less development and initial stage international work than originally anticipated. As we look ahead, combat's international opportunities, combined with current backlog, provide relative top line stability as international workflow mitigates some slowing in our U.S. programs. The group's mature program mix will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years. Marine systems. The Marine Systems group had another good quarter with sales of $1.7 billion, up 12% over the year-ago period and 4% sequentially. Earnings totaled $169 million, up 9% over last year and consistent with last quarter's results. Sales and earnings growth were driven by growing Virginia class volume and SSBN replacement design efforts. The group's third quarter operating margin was 9.9%, down modestly from both the year-ago period and the prior quarter due to mixed shift in our surface combatant programs. With that said, this operating margin exceeded my expectations due to particularly good performance at Electric Boat and NASSCO. Electric Boat's third quarter delivery of USS Missouri is representative of the focus on execution resident at each of our three ERs. EB delivered this submarine in a record 65 months, five months faster than any of the six prior Virginia class boats. Missouri required 600,000 fewer labor hours than EB's last Virginia class sub and was 8% under target cost. Marines backlog totaled $20.6 billion at the end of the third quarter down 3% from the end of last quarter. Despite this decline, the group booked several key orders in the quarter including funding for Bath Iron Works to continue providing management, engineering and detailed design developments for the DDG 51 program. NASSCO also received funding for advanced engineering and long lead materials for the new mobile landing platform, MLP. And in final contract negotiations with our customer, we expect to add several construction contract to vast backlog in the first half of next year, including, the DDG's 1001 and 1002, the second and third of the Zumwalt Class and the DDG 115, the restart of the DDG 51 program. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group sales will look similar to the third quarter with operating margins in the mid-9% range as the surface combatants mix shift of Bath Iron Works becomes more apparent. For the full year, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year and margins will be in the high-9% range, slightly better than my prior guidance. Looking ahead, our shipyards enjoy a healthy backlog and an attractive opportunity set. In addition to our Navy work, we continue to see renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers and anticipate that we can leverage our excellent commercial tanker performance to win new commericial work in 2011. Over the next two to three years, you will see the potential for margin improvements as surface combatant fixed-price work builds, commercial ship building opportunities materialize and construction on two per year Virginia is realized. Aerospace. The Aerospace group's third quarter results were marked by improved order activity, service volume and operational performance. Group sales were nearly $1.3 billion, up 15% from last year's third quarter due to more green aircraft deliveries and higher services volume. Earnings were $199 million, a nearly 60% increase over the same period last year while margins were 15.4%, a 420 basis point improvement. When compared with this year's second quarter, sales, earnings and margins were down due to the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, which caused fewer green deliveries and the timing of R&D cost. I expect sales, earnings and margins to show improvement in the fourth quarter. The business jet market, particularly in the large cabin long-range segment, continue to make strides toward recovery in the third quarter, including further reduction in preowned aircraft levels. Gulfstream took one preowned aircraft and trade this quarter and sold two aircraft for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, Gulfstream had no preowned aircraft in inventory. Customer interest remains healthy as Gulfstream booked more orders in the third quarter than in any quarter since the economic downturn began in mid-2008. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book-to-bill was a 1.2x. Orders handily outpaced defaults resulting in a modest 1% decline in the backlog from the end of the second quarter. The group's backlog remains a robust $17.6 billion. In addition to current backlog, our pipeline of new opportunities remain strong. We continued to experience strong international order activity and interest, particularly in the emerging markets. In the quarter, Latin America and Asia-Pacific represented nearly 1/3 of order activity and now comprise over 40% of backlog. Recent orders span the entirety of our in production and new aircraft portfolio. Flying hours improved again this quarter, a reality that helped Gulfstream service facilities enjoy their highest quarterly volume ever. Year-to-date, Gulfstream's service business is up 18.5%. Beyond improved utilization figures and a growing installed fleet, Gulfstream service volumes reflects their unwavering commitment to provide a best-in-class support. In the quarter, Gulfstream's large cabin business jets were voted number one for the eighth consecutive year in the annual AIA Product Support survey. Jet Aviation Service business has also enjoyed healthy growth this year, up nearly 10% year-to-date. As the international install fleet grows, we are adapting by growing our Product Support organization, which is the largest in the industry today. Jet continues to enhance its service offerings across the globe with particular emphasis in Asia, a region whose installed base promises to grow rapidly over the next several years. Although Jet's service related sales were up in the quarter, overall volume was down modestly from last quarter on lower completion revenue. Business jet completions work has been lighter this year as OEMs delivered fewer aircraft. Conversely, the narrow-body wide-body pipeline remains robust. And Jet signed agreements to complete three more of these aircraft in August. Jet continues to take steps to improve probability including consolidating its U.S. completions and MRO operations at its Skokie, Illinois facility near St. Louis. Planned deliveries for large cabin aircraft are on track at 75 this year. Mid-cabin orders were more plentiful than anticipated in the quarter and I now expect the total approaching 30 this year, several more than I guided you to in July. We continue to make exciting progress on the product development front. With three G250 aircraft and four soon to be five, G650 aircraft in flight test, we are on glide slope toward 2011 FAA IASA certification for both aircraft. In fact, recently, the fourth G650 test article and the first ever Gulfstream test article with a fully-outfitted interior, flew the fastest ultra range, long-range flight ever flown by a business jet. This is a compelling demonstration of the G650's exceptional high-speed cruise capabilities. That was 5,000 nautical miles at 0.9 mach in nine hours and 45 minutes. Both aircraft flew to NBAA in Atlanta, Georgia last week, with the G250 making its maiden transatlantic voyage en route. For the full year, I expect the Aerospace group sales to be up mid-single-digit above last year, slightly higher than my prior guidance due to better than anticipated service volume. Operating margins will also be better than previously anticipated, close to 16%. As we look to the future, the group will enjoy steady top line growth, driven by new product introduction and improving service volume. We will continue to manage this business with great discipline on the up cycle as we did through the down. In summary, General Dynamics continues to perform well and remains positioned for a good fourth quarter. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.70 to $6.75, an increase from my prior guidance. As we look toward 2011, the defense and Aerospace markets remain dynamic. Amidst the uncertainty of a fast changing market place and budget adjustments, we remain focused on execution as we believe this will enable us to leverage our incumbency to win new opportunities. Our defense backlog already includes a solid order book for next year and we are encouraged by the Congressional support our programs have received in the 2011 defense budget appropriations process. Consequently, as we look to the future, I believe General Dynamics will offer a sustaining Defense business with excellent operating margins and strong free cash flow. In addition, our Aerospace business will be the growth engine throughout the near and intermediate timeframe. We are aggressively managing our businesses for profitability, with continued emphasis on earnings growth and efficient conversion of earnings to cash. Our strong balance sheet and excellent cash outlook afford us to tremendous flexibility to continue deploying capital in a balanced manner in order to create the greatest long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?
Jay Johnson: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some observations about our cash performance and financing activities. As you know, we experienced growth in working capital through the first half of the year due to timing of contract payments, particularly in our IS&T business. Continued focus on this area has begun to yield positive results. In the third quarter, we reversed the trend and trimmed 2010 OWC growth by 1/3. You can see the impact of that effort and the impact that had on strong free cash flow performance in the quarter. In addition, as Jay noted, we repaid $700 million of fixed rate Notes in the third quarter. As a result of strong free cash flow and debt repayment, we've reduced our net debt by almost $400 million in the quarter. This leaves us at the end of the third quarter with a strong balance sheet and a debt to equity ratio of just under 24%. With the third quarter debt repayment, we're expecting net interest expense for the year of between $155 million to $160 million, consistent with our previous guidance but probably toward the lower end of that range. I should point out that in 2011, we're planning a $750 million debt repayment and a $300 million pension contribution, very similar to the debt repayment in the pension contribution made in 2010. Finally, a quick note on our tax rate, I previously guided you to a range, which was as low as 31.2%. That range was predicated largely on a then in process of 2009 tax return. As we finalized the return in the third quarter, we identified some additional R&D tax credits that drove the rate to the lower end of our range. At this point, we're forecasting an effective rate of 31.2% for the year with some opportunity to improve. That compares with the full year rate of 31.5% last year. The tax rate in the third quarter reflects the true up to the reduced full year rate. That completes my remarks and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you. As a quick reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Derek, could you please remind participants how to enter queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have the first question coming from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America: Just a quick question on the Aerospace side, and how demand for the G650 and G250 has been tracking over the last quarter, have you see any interesting moves in the back of them?
Jay Johnson: Rob, I would say that activity has been very steady and encouraging on both aircraft types. The 650 backlog, as you know, has been very strong all along and we are now up at about 200 orders and looking good. The 250 is taking orders as well. We've talked about that before. It was a little early to give it to the order book, it shows well that NBAA and the people are actually seeing the airplane now, it's doing well in-flight test so that order book is starting to develop as well and so we're very bullish on both of them.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America: Are you able at this space to give it a little bit more clarity on how you expect the G250 to ramp up?
Jay Johnson: It will enter into service late next year, as you know and we'll ramp it up as the market dictates, but we think our timing relative to recovery in the mid-cabin market, looks pretty good at this point. So we'll see how it goes but as I said, the order activity and the general interest in that 250 aircraft is increasing essentially week by week. So like I say, we're pretty bullish on that one and you know we are on the 650.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG: Jay, that was a great amount of detail, and much appreciated, on IS&T and you talked about the sub businesses there, could you perhaps, given what's going on inside the Beltway, talk about the longer-term growth trends for each of those businesses and maybe highlight some of the pressure points on sales or margins?
Jay Johnson: Well, the areas that I highlighted for us are all growth opportunities. I mean the battle space management, technical communications piece, as I described, which is what, 45% of the business, really in one instance is the core network communication systems for the United States Army in the 21st century going forward. So that will be an ever-growing and you know we're passing through LRIP and WIN-T and we're expecting an LRIP decision on JTRS here within the next two quarters, I think. So that business will continue to mature and develop going forward. The IT services piece for us is very, very good business, both in the infrastructure, the support, the healthcare, IT. So we've got many opportunities across what I'd call a diverse growth portfolio in IT. And with that, we've got our ISR that I talked about which is 20% of the portfolio but again, it recognized and necessary fast current in both DoD space and frankly, in agency space and commercial applications. All around that, cyber, which will take a big tent with lots of players in it for as long as the eye can see, we believe, and we're well grounded in cyber, as I mentioned in my remarks. I see all of that and more giving us tremendous opportunity in IS&T going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies & Company.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Jay, could you talk a little bit more about, I mean you talked a lot about combat but just sort of the evolving change that's occurred, one would have expected a lot of this hard metal to pretty much be in place for third quarter and some of it seems to have slipped, maybe you can sort of talk about what sort of your marching orders you're expecting from that group going forward?
Jay Johnson: The first thing I would say about combat in terms of the year is that the execution at the business level has been outstanding in all respects. So we've got a great team doing superb work across a global scale here. I'm very proud of them. Now as to the sales, a tendency of that performance, we had as you know, a very, what I would call with a clarity of hindsight, a very aggressive sales plan at the start of the year, which has been softened by the reality, mostly timing realities of the world scene. So I would tell you that the first half of the year, in terms of sales growth, if you will, pretty much happened the way we thought it would and I think I've been saying all along that we were heavily loaded to the second half of the year, which is not terribly unusual for combat, but it was more so this year than I think perhaps historically. So we we're heavily loaded to the second half of the year. I would tell you, in addition to what I said in my remarks about year-over-year comparisons with MRAP volume growing away and NCSD being canceled, a lot of what we are seeing, Howard, is just the timing of these programs. The indigenous vehicle programs we are seeing the European sovereign debt realities impact us in Spain with the 8x8 competition that was going to happen this year has been moved into the mid year of 2011 but reaffirmed by the Spanish Ministry of Defense has being essential to the Spanish Army. so we believe that one will still come. There others in Portugal and other European countries that have pushed out a little bit, prolonging contract negotiations. I am sure things, if you will, the Canadian LAV is probably the best example of that, $850 million, I mentioned it in my remarks. It's happening, as we speak, we're in development, contract execution right now. We'll get the production contract in 2011 and off we go. And by the way there, Howard, I should just mentioned on the Canadian side, when we talk about that LAV upgrade, we also talk about the technical Armored Patrol Vehicles and the CCV as a downrange programs that are coming, but just in the last few days, it's been reaffirmed by my source with the Army chief up there, basically ties this as a family of land combat vehicles that will all be, the RFPs for TAPV CTV are going to happen this year according to him and so we'll be in production, whoever gets that will be in production from 2012 to 2015. So it's coming, it's just not here this year. With the UK scout vehicle, which in contract right now on development but it will be more to follow in the coming years. The international vehicle export business we've talked about before, the FMS LAVs and some of the tanks, we've got some of them, we've got more to come. Some of them we expect here in the fourth quarter. Would I bet everything on the fourth quarter, no. But if it's not in the fourth quarter, it will be in 2011. So it's all coming. The U.S. vehicle business, we've had D-scope on some of the programs that we've talked about earlier in the year, Cougar MOD is one of them, the remote weapon system for Stryker is another one that comes to mind. We've had to lay our new programs like the GCV as I talked about and honestly, a little bit of lumpiness, I guess you could say, in kind of the reset and modification work on Stryker and Abrams as the force reconstitutes or repositions itself in some measures. And then on the weapon systems business, we've seen some delay as well. Armor is a classic example and then we had some softness in the commercial axle market and some of the aftermarket that goes with that actually is coming in now but anyway, I think that's probably more than you ask me for but to sum it all, I would say it was also a very strong order quarter for combat which also bodes well, I think, for the rest of the year and for 2011. Historically, European Land Systems has been the strongest in the fourth quarter, I expect that to happen again this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: We've got this U.K. strategy defense and security review and I want to get some clarity as obviously, there was a bit of surprise in terms of delays in 2010, which is probably going to affect your guidance in 2011. Can you give us some color on what effect you see tightening of European budgets in terms of its potential effect on 2011 sales and time of expected awards?
Jay Johnson: With absolute precision, I can't do that, Heidi. But my sense is, I mentioned for example, the Spanish 8x8, we believe every indication we have says that, that decision will be rendered by mid-2011 and the U.K. piece is proceeding at pace and we're in at development contract of like $750 million, I think, to develop the first seven or so vehicles, all that is going. So for us, the strategic defense review in the U.K. was, we came out of that quite nicely, actually, between the scout vehicle decision and the implications that it has for our program over there, et cetera. So we'll see program movement to the right in 2011, again I'm not naive enough to believe that won't happen but as I've told you before nobody has pulled any cards off of the table yet, it's just the question of positioning in so that they can deal with them respectively in their countries given their financial status.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: It looks like the default activities in the quarter ended up $400 million, can you just give us some color on the level of liquidity damage and also should we expect to see a slowdown in that through the rest of the year?
Jay Johnson: The default activity, honestly, was modest, shall we say. The order activity was really strong, the liquidated damages, Myles, were de minimus. I expect the order book to continue to grow. I expect the default activity to continue at a small or a low, but steady, as we've talked before, level. People move in, people move out, but remember, our discussions about backlog and sweet spots in large cabin, we're still looking at an 18-month backlog for both G450 and G550. And if I seem distracted it's because we're having a horrendous storm right now I can barely hear myself for the rain hitting the windows, and I apologize. But the backlog is strong and you know with the order book is like on the G650 and now the 250 is building so we're bullish on all of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Jay, you gave us the gains in services year-to-date. Could you give us some color on what the two services businesses were up both sequentially and year-over-year. And secondly, update us on the expected green deliveries of the G650s for next year?
Jay Johnson: I can't pull that number off out of my head, Cai. Give Amy call about that. I wanted to say, did I say was 18.5% year-to-date but we're very -- the service is improving as the flight activity increases which is happening out there certainly in the Gulfstream. But the green deliveries on 650s will start late next year, how many, I'm not exactly sure yet probably 10 to 12 is kind of the hip pocket number I got in my head right now. And then you know I think I've talked before about the production rates on advertising right now in 12, 13 and 14 of 17, 33 and 33, which before someone asked me, yes, we would look forward to accelerating past that but we're just not ready to do that, yet, although we are encouraged by everything we see and experience with the G650.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Jay, could you talk about your thoughts on potentially raising additional debt in the current low interest rate environment and then second, on pension. I know it doesn't impact you guys like it does the other defense companies, but talk about maybe what impact it could have on 2011, given what we're potentially seeing on the discount rate side?
Jay Johnson: I'll take the last part first. Frankly, you said our pension exposure right now is very much under control. We paid $270 million this year, we think we'll probably pay $300 million next year and it won't get in the way of anything else we need to do as far as capital deployment goes. And so we don't anticipate any cosmic changes there in terms of what our requirement will be. As to do debt market, I know it's a favorite question that we get a lot, but I would just tell you that truly keeping with the way General Dynamics does business, which I'd like to think is very disciplined, we kind of don't go to the debt market unless we have a specific reason for going to the debt market. If I got a purpose in mind that we need to go, we've got plenty of access to go there but we don't do it just to get some cash. We've got $2 billion in credit facilities, we're great cash generators, we have lots of cash on hand right now and so we'll continue to generate more. It gives us the flexibility we need to be acquisitive, which we historically as you know have been and will continue to be as opportunities present themselves. So we're not inclined to go to the debt market for good deals because actually the commercial paper market right now, which we have got great access to, would give us more attractive rates than the debt market. We also retired our $700 million notes this year at par with essentially no economic cost to us. So we think we're managing that size in a pretty balanced manner.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Just back on the Combat Systems, can you just talk a little bit about, it sounds like the mix in terms of the development and engineering which helps you this year, should I be thinking about as we go into next year that, that's going to put some pressure on the margins and then your number for this year implies something on the order of $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter, I know European Land Systems helps, but does that imply something closer to a double-digit type of growth rate next year from the lower base this year? As things start to move in?
L. Redd: I'm not ready to really speak to next year yet, Sam, but clearly, the fourth quarter will be the strongest quarter and I think, if I didn't say this earlier, I think I meant to. But at any rate, it will be -- it's always strong in combat, ELS is a large part of that reality, but this year it will be stronger still and that kind of was the plan all the way along and the way things are coming to fruition, it will indeed be the plan for the rest of this year. So the margin attachments to that, the margins we received that we gained this time are outsized, shall we say, a little bit. I would think of this wonderful business that we have in the Combat Systems as kind of a 13% steady go business going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch: You said about 13% margins on a go forward basis, so what we saw this quarter was a little bit of an anomaly in terms of the strength of the margins in Combat Systems?
Jay Johnson: A little bit, yes.
Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch: And what drove that?
Jay Johnson: One, I'll say it again, but one is not an anomaly and that's the performance of the team in Combat Systems. But some of it has to do with mix shift, some of it has to do with just timing of the products in our portfolio and the way they come to us and all of that kind of coalesced to give us more uplift in kind of a perfect storm that we're up right now. But for calibration purposes, I think I would bring my head in around 13% up or down, a little from that. And engineering, too, by the way, did I say that?
Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch: On the Gulfstream front, can you just give us an update on how flight test is going on both the 650 and the 250?
Jay Johnson: You, bet. In a word or two words, very well. The 250 there are three birds in flight test right now. I mentioned that one of them, which I finally got to see, touch and sit in, in Atlanta flew obviously, transatlantic from Israel, but then was going to do a number of its test points here in the United States before going back to Israel. Everything is looking good. I talked to the pilot, test pilots in both aircraft, we're very happy. The 650 continues to, shall we say, outperform in all corners of the flight envelope. It's magnificent. I would also take this opportunity to mention that -- I said it before but it's worth foot-stomping, I think, the test bird that was down in Atlanta at NBAA was a full interior as the same bird that we used to get the 5000-mile .9 mark, nine hour and 45 minutes. So we're simply taking a service bird into the test regimen and getting all or more than we expected out of it. If you can't tell, we're very pleased.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JP Morgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just from a high-level. It's a tough environment. I think is in Washington is the consensus in the defense broadly and some of your peers have noted that the last week or so in their calls, and your Combat business has seen the impact of that in terms of the guidance coming down the last couple of quarters this year. I'm just trying to reconcile some of the commentary on a sort of go forward numbers not only in combat but IS&T, steady growth the next several years, some of the comments on Marine which was are bullish, do you think GD is just -- these businesses are just much better positioned than the industry? Or and I try to reconcile I guess the environment in your commentary, it's good to be optimistic, but how do I get comfortable with that guidance given the environment.
Jay Johnson: Well first of all, I'm not giving guidance for next year or beyond. But I think if you look at the portfolio, if you look at the relevance of the businesses, I mean the Marine group is going to be building Virginia class submarines for a long time. As we've talked before, the Navy will need surface combatants of scale that we build for a long time, so that the work flowed in the repair appended to that will be, certainly, I would categorize is as steady, if not some growth going forward. And I'm being realistic in terms of how I think of defense, it's not going to grow like it has been, very obviously. But we do believe that there maybe some modest growth opportunity in there and what I cited in the past calls in IS&T, are a classic example of that. On the combat side, that's a steady business as we see it right now. We see a lot of 2011 already in program or record. And if you look at the United States Army, for example, and look at the 20-some heavy brigade combat teams and the seven going to eight and probably going to nine, Stryker Brigade Combat Teams with the former at 60 Abrams per brigade and the latter at 330 plus Strykers per brigade, that kid is not going to change until you see a fundamental change in the fore structure of the United States Army. So we try to think of it in pragmatic terms, thread based and core based, if you will, and that really I think performed the core basis of my comments as much as anything, Joe. And on the Aerospace side, that is clearly a growth engine for everyone, I would say, in the industry but particularly when you're driving the premier brand, the Gulfstream with new products about to hit the street with 200 plus airplanes in the G650 queue, et cetera. So put all that together and you've got, I believe, a very steady, sustaining Defense business. Could things change? That depends on budgets and all the realities, but I still believe with everything I've got that the threat and the appetite for risk taking at a national strategic level will drive the defense budget as much as anything. Will there be pressure? Is there pressure? Good lord, yes. Will it tighten, it already is in every segment we deal with. There's no question about that so we're not denying any of that. But we deal with it day by day, contract by contract, platform by platform, system by system and we think we deal with it very well.
Amy Gilliland: And, Derek, I think we have time for one more question this afternoon.
Operator: The final question will come from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: I just wanted to focus in on a very specific question on IS&T. If you have much exposure to GP Comm the closure is that one of those 2% programs that you talked about, you didn't have any programs larger than 2% in IS&T. And someone asked earlier what the revenue outlook was and you did a great job of explaining that for IS&T but I think you were asked about the margin outlook and I don't think you had an opportunity, yet, to address that so I wondered if you would do that now?
Jay Johnson: The margin piece, it's a double-digit margin business. If you're talking about IS&T, right?
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: Yes and the outlook, going forward.
Jay Johnson: We'll be double-digit in IS&T. We lever that right now, we're proud of it and we have every reason to believe we'll sustain it. The GP Comm piece, I won't go into the whole, you know the story, you know the story, I think Jason, but for us, the impact for us, we have I think probably 300 folks attached to or working with the joint forces command down there in Tidewater. I mean we'll see what happens, how this shapes out. But I believe, what we're hearing and feeling now is as GP Comm stood down or reported somewhere else in some way, shape or fashion, not all of those missions are going to be eliminated and we would expect to move with wherever those missions are translated to. So all that said, it's not a major impact on us, certainly, and we'll go with the mission. If the mission moves, then we'll reconstitute somewhere else if all parts of it is eliminated.
Operator: At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Amy Gilliland for any closing remarks.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3748. Have a great day. Stay dry.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2010 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Anne, and I will be your coordinator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Anne, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter Conference Call.  As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay Johnson: Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' second quarter performance was solid, delivering $8.1 billion in sales and record operating earnings of $985 million. This led to earnings per share of $1.68 on a fully diluted basis, $0.07 ahead of last year's second quarter and $0.14 ahead of last quarter. Operating margins in all four groups were very strong in the quarter, driving 12.2% company margins, 50 basis points better than last year's second quarter and 40 basis points better than last quarter. Second quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $414 million, approximately 64% of earnings from continuing operations. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $564 million, relatively consistent with last year's performance. I expect strong cash generation in the second half.  We deployed $190 million of cash in the quarter to make two acquisitions that complement our core Combat Systems and IS&T businesses. We also took advantage of market conditions to buy 5.5 million shares of GD common stock in the open market.  Orders this quarter exceeded $7 billion, over $1 billion more than last year's second quarter with robust activity in the Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at $62.5 billion. Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups. And first, let's talk about Combat Systems. Combat Systems second quarter was marked by excellent operational performance across the business. Sales volume totaled $2.1 billion, up from the first quarter, but down from the same period a year ago, due to less MRAP volume, the cancellation of FCS and Stryker timing. In the second half, we anticipate stronger MRAP and Stryker volume.  Earnings were essentially flat when compared with last year's second quarter, despite the decline in sales, as margins expanded across the portfolio. The 150-basis-point margin improvement is the result of better program mix, with volume concentrated in more mature procurement programs and improved operating performance. Compared to last quarter, earnings grew nearly 10% to $295 million.  Total backlog for Combat Systems decreased modestly to $12.8 billion in the quarter. Order activity outpaced sales at three of the four businesses, including European Land Systems, which had its strongest order activity since the second quarter of last year.  Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $500 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $200 million for United Kingdom's Scout vehicle development work, $35 million for the development phase of the Canadian LAV upgrade program and nearly $300 million for Hydra rockets. We expect to book several additional large international orders this year.  Looking forward for the group, sales in the remainder of the year will be higher than both year-to-date and last year's second half, with particular strength in the fourth quarter. That said, my overall assessment now shows sales in 2010 to be essentially flat to slightly below 2009.  As I mentioned on the first quarter call, the growth originally projected in 2010 was influenced heavily by international work in the second half of the year. A confluence of factors, including the European sovereign debt crisis, prolonged contract negotiations and the decline in the euro has changed our international sales outlook for this year.  The sovereign debt crisis has delayed the award of the Spanish 8x8 program until 2011. However, the Spanish government remains committed to this program, having stated publicly that it remains a top defense priority.  Prolonged contract negotiations slowed the award of our Canadian LAV program, which will now transition to production in 2011 rather than this year. A several hundred million dollar FMS LAV Award will also push out until late this year or early next year. Additionally at current exchange rates, the decline in the euro would reduce sales by nearly $150 million by year and. This is translation rather than meaningful economic impact, and obviously could vary depending on where the euro settles relative to the dollar at year end. Our U.S. Core business received some unanticipated awards in the first half to include 250 RG-31s, stronger than expected EXCEL awards and Stryker development work. These positives have been somewhat offset by delays in awards at our Weapons Systems business and some reduction in contract scope in other programs. Not withstanding the adjusted sales outlook for 2010, full year earnings will be consistent with my original expectations. Margins will be in the mid-13% range, up approximately 50 to 60 basis points from my prior guidance, due to the favorable mix mentioned earlier. As we look to the future, Combat's portfolio is well positioned. Let me briefly review four key components of this group's business. First, U.S. vehicles, comprised just over 50% of 2009 Combat sales, obviously driven by the Stryker and Abrams programs, which are core to today's army and will remain so for years to come. Current backlog, continued vehicle enhancements and reset opportunities will sustain these two mature programs.  We are also competing on an array of next-generation vehicle programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which could offer upside in the longer term. In the event that any of these developmental programs are delayed, we see continued opportunity for our current vehicles. Secondly, U.S. weapons systems and ammunition. At approximately 1/3 of 2009 combat sales, they provide an array of critical systems and ammunition products to a wide range of U.S. and international customers. The core programs in these businesses remain well supported in the midterm, while new opportunities in precision munitions, armor, commercial axles, Denel and international ammunition bode well for the longer term.  Thirdly, international FMS and export vehicles. We expect to grow substantially over the next four years as we begin delivering light-armored vehicles and tanks to a variety of Middle Eastern customers. We are currently working four contracts, totaling close to $4 billion, with deliveries between 2011 and 2014. Two of those contracts, worth nearly $2.5 billion for FMS LAVs and Iraqi tanks are now in backlog. The other two contracts for additional FMS LAVs and tanks could add $1.4 billion to backlog before year end. These FMS sales present a meaningful opportunity, around $800 million to $1 billion of volume per year between 2011 and 2014. And finally, international indigenous vehicles. One of our key market discriminators here is that we are residents in many of the countries where we manufacture and sell vehicles, thus making our employees an important component of local GDP. There have been several recent positive developments in this business, including: solidifying the first complement of the Canadian LAV upgrade program, which when added to backlog next year, will contribute another $850 million to sales between 2011 and 2013; selection as the preferred supplier for a five-year $100 million deal to sustain Australia's armored fighting vehicle fleet; and finalizing a contract worth several hundred million dollars over the next three years to develop and deliver Scout Specialist Vehicles to the British Army.  Clearly the sovereign debt crisis has added some uncertainty to our European business over the past quarter. In June, I visited our European businesses. And while their situation remains dynamic, it was clear that in spite of timelines moving to the right, our programs remain in high demand. No programs have been eliminated or taken off the table.  National security remains an important spending priority, even when times are austere and our indigenous workforce provides an important economic engine in many of these economies. We are setting the international standard for the next generation of armored vehicles, and I feel confident in our opportunities to provide best-in-class vehicles at affordable prices for years to come. In summary, the Combat Systems portfolio of products is well placed in today's fighting force and is complemented by a healthy set of near and long-term opportunities. These opportunities, combined with the current backlog, provide relative stability in our core Domestic businesses and growth in our international workload. This will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years. Marine Systems. Marine Systems group delivered another solid quarter. Revenues were up slightly, though earnings were consistent with last year's second quarter at $1.6 billion and $167 million, respectively. This is a particularly good performance as last year's results reflected 17% sales and 32% earnings growth.  Sales in the quarter were up at Electric Boat and Bath Iron Works reflecting increased Virginia and DDG 1000 volume and expand an SSBN replacement design efforts. This growth was somewhat offset by a decline in NASSCO sales due to repair volume timing and the ramp down of the commercial product carrier program.  Marines margins in the quarter were 10.2%, up 40 basis points from the first quarter. The Marine group's backlog totaled $21.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 3.6% from the first quarter. We anticipate adding the second and third DDG 1000 ships to this backlog, either later this year or early next year, pending final contract negotiations with our customer. In the second quarter, the group received funding for long-lead materials for these ships.  Group sales will grow progressively through the second half, driven by the continued ramp to two-per-year Virginia class submarine production. Overall, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year, somewhat below my prior guidance. This change reflects continued weakness in the Commercial Shipbuilding business.  We are, however, seeing renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers, including the dry cargo market, container ships and some tankers. Our excellent performance on the current five-ship product carrier program positions us to capitalize on a number of these contracts, most likely starting next year.  Group margins for the year should be around the mid 9% range, consistent with my earlier guidance. Margins will decline as the year progresses, due to the surface combatant workload mix shift, which will escalate in the second half. Given the group's consistently excellent operating performance in managing for profitability, there may be some upside to my 9.5% margin guidance.  Looking longer term, our shipyards are poised for slow, steady top line growth predicated on a healthy backlog and opportunities set. While the group faces a margin headwind in the near term, I see opportunity to expand margins, as surface combatant fixed price work builds, commercial shipbuilding opportunities materialize and two-per-year Virginia is realized. IS&T. Our IS&T group had its highest ever revenue and earnings quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion, up 12% over second quarter 2009 and 6.3% year-to-date. Sales growth was driven by continued demand for our ruggedized mobile computing and tactical communications products, an increased intelligence, IT and infrastructure support work. The group's second quarter operating earnings were $312 million, up 10% year-over-year and 7.6%, sequentially. Operating margins were 10.5%, in line with the first quarter and my expectation for this year. Backlog for the group increased by over $300 million this quarter, as book to bill exceeded 1x again. Awards were particularly strong in our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses. The businesses were also selected to compete on several large multiyear IDIQ contracts, which contributed to a 28% increase in our potential contract value. Many of these awards are detailed in our press release.  IS&T's volume in the second half will exceed both last year's second half and this year's first half. Overall, I expect group sales to be up 8% to 9%, perhaps closer to the midpoint of that range. And margins will remain around 10.5%, both consistent with previous guidance. Looking beyond 2010, IS&T's highly diverse portfolio positions the group to leverage its current capabilities to capture new business in fast-growing market segments. Tactical communications and battlefield management remain high customer spending priorities.  Two weeks ago, many of our tactical communications products, including WIN-T and JTRS were part of a U.S. Army, Brigade Combat Team integration exercise that showcased their technical maturity and critical networking capabilities. As these programs transition to production over the next several years, they will enhance sales growth and margins.  IT intelligence, infrastructure and healthcare support represents some of the other faster currents in the groups' marketplace. Sales growth will also be driven by the rapidly expanding cyber market, where IS&T has a very strong position with an array of government and commercial customers. Aerospace. The Aerospace group's results were marked by excellent operational performance and new product development progress. Order intake was somewhat slower than anticipated, but year-to-date orders are in line with expectations. The group's second quarter sales were $1.38 billion, down modestly from last year's second quarter, due to fewer pre-owned aircraft sales at Gulfstream and less completions volume at Jet Aviation. The group's earnings were up 8.4%. Margins were 16.8%, a 160-basis-point improvement resulting from expanded Gulfstream volumes and margins, improved jet aviation completions margin and lower SG&A and R&D costs. We continue to see signs of gradual improvement in the business jet market. Gulfstream flying hours are up. And we enjoyed a 16% improvement in the group's services sales versus last year's second quarter and a 7% improvement year-to-date. Additionally, market pre-owned aircraft levels continue to decline. At the end of the second quarter, Gulfstream had one pre-owned aircraft and inventory, and it is under contract. We anticipate receiving no more than three additional pre-owned aircraft before year end. Customer interest in Gulfstream aircraft remains healthy, despite a slowdown in order intake in the second half of the quarter. Orders outpaced defaults by 3:1, while defaults were at their lowest level of this downturn. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book to bill was 0.6x. At $17.8 billion, our backlog includes nearly 200 G650 orders and approximately $6 billion in orders for our in-service aircraft. This is a very solid and sustaining backlog. Orders in the quarter spanned the entirety of our product portfolio, with roughly 2/3 for the large-cabin aircraft and 1/3 for the mid cabins. Second quarter orders also reflected renewed interest in our North American markets, which were essentially dormant following last year's financial crisis and ensuing anti-business jet rhetoric. We also continue to see relative orders strength across several emerging markets including the Asia Pacific region, one of the strongest markets for business aviation and from for in particular.  In addition to current backlog, we have a healthy pipeline of new opportunities, which we believe will translate to orders as the financial markets recover from a turbulent second quarter. Large cabin deliveries remain on track and will total 76 this year. As you may recall, Gulfstream completed a two-week furlough in July, which will result in fewer large cabin deliveries in the third quarter. The mid cabin business continue to show improvement in the second quarter and now exceeds my original expectations for 14 deliveries this year. I expect to deliver a total of 21 midsized jets this year, with some further upside if second half demands, nears what we've seen in the first half. For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be up low to mid-single digits consistent with my prior guidance. Operating margins will be better than previously anticipated, probably in the mid-15% range with some upside.  On the product development front, there are now three G250 aircraft and four G650 aircraft in flight test and 2011 FAA and EASA certification for both aircraft remain on track. As we look toward the next several years, the group will enjoy steady top line growth as we begin G650 deliveries in the second half of 2011, and the Services business continues to expand commensurate with the growing installed base.  Our current order book and a healthy pipeline of potential new customer orders bode well for sustaining production of our G450 and G550 aircraft at or near current levels. The group's margins should continue to expand, driven in part by continued improvement of Jet Aviation and the transition to full rate production on our new aircraft models. We will continue to aggressively manage this business for profitability on the up as we did through the down. In summary, General Dynamics executed well in the first half of 2010 and is well positioned for similar success in the second half. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.60 to $6.65, an increase from my prior guidance.  Before concluding my remarks, I'd like to comment on today's dynamic business environment, particularly as it relates to our Defense businesses. Within this environment, the Pentagon's commitment to maintaining current force structure levels, which are sized to address the evolving threat environment, remains unchanged. While the post-9/11 world allows for little near-term defense budget reduction, pressures to manage discretionary spending will undoubtedly increase in the out years.  I certainly appreciate the challenge the deficit-reduction emphasis represents for future defense spending. Over the past quarter, Secretary of Defense, Gates, and his senior leadership team have aggressively embarked upon a series of initiatives focused on making the Pentagon, a more cost-effective, efficient organization. Improving efficiency is particularly important to achieving the Pentagon's goal of preserving for structure, to appropriately organize, train and equip today's force to fight, weapons spending will have to show some growth in the years ahead.  In a flat-budget environment, the Defense Department must extract savings from within its own budget to achieve this required growth. Having focused on achieving savings in the weapons accounts last year, the Pentagon now appears focused primarily on extracting overhead savings from operations and maintenance budget, the tail, to support investment account requirements, the tooth.  The specifics of the Pentagon's efficiency initiatives are not yet evident, but what is clear, is that the environment is changing and that all stakeholders will have a role to play. I am personally involved with other CEOs in a cooperative dialogue to develop procedures that will achieve needed results while protecting the viability of the Defense industrial base. I'm encouraged that the Pentagon has engaged the industry as it embarks on shaping these measures.  General Dynamics is already a very lean and efficient operator. We will continue to support our customer in pursuing even greater value for the defense dollar. Our Defense businesses have all experienced strong support in the ongoing 2011 budget deliberations. While there are several steps remaining before the 2011 budget, Defense bill becomes law, I remain confident that GD's core programs will receive solid Congressional support.  General Dynamics is particularly well positioned to excel in this fast-changing environment. Low costs and quality production continue to enhance our competitiveness. Our streamlined business model limits overhead expense and empowers our business unit presidents to remain entrepreneurial and agile.  And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?
L. Redd: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with a couple of notes on capital deployment in the second half of the year. We have $700 million of fixed rate notes that are still due to mature in August. We plan to satisfy that obligations with cash on hand. As a result, we'll see lower interest expense in the second half of the year, and we expect full year interest expense to be somewhere between $155 million and $160 million. We are also scheduled to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plans of approximately $270 million in September.  I would like to also point out that we recently renewed our 364-day bank line, increasing it by about $200 million and extending the term to three years. This increases our commercial paper capacity to approximately $2 billion. The increased commercial paper capacity, along with the debt repayment in the third quarter, further bolsters our strong balance sheet and gives us capacity to execute on future opportunities. Finally, an update on our expectations for our effective tax rate. I had previously guided you to a rate of 31.5% with some 20 to 30 basis points of exposure, meaning risk that the rate could be as high as 31.8%. Given our experience in the first half and what we see ahead of us for the remainder of the year, the rate is still looking like 31.5%, but with the opportunity to come in 20 to 30 basis points lower rather than higher.  So that completes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A. Amy?
Amy Gilliland: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And Anne, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Jay, thanks for all the detail around Combat Systems. I think previously, you had talked about Combat Systems growing at a low single-digit rate beyond 2010. With all the stuff that's happened to your outlook for 2010, what do you now see as the potential growth rate out looking beyond that?
Jay Johnson: David, based on what I see today, I still consider the slow steady growth sustaining to be appropriate. What do I mean by that? If you look at the core U.S. businesses that I talked about, Stryker and Abrams in particular, that's going to be steady business going forward, okay? Not all of that's apparent in the budget rooms [ph] you see today. But what we see in work right now, for example, with some of the Stryker development in double-V hull, et cetera, it bodes well for stability in those programs going forward. And then as I mentioned in my remarks, in the international space, we do see that as a growth business. And I also alluded to the fact that some of what we saw originally projected to arrive in 2010 is more moving to the right into 2011, and perhaps in some cases, even beyond. So that to me, bodes well for a stable to slightly nose up growth opportunity in Combat going forward.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: And just as a follow-up, low single-digit growth, what are you assuming for the guns, bullets, the stuff that has exposure to the supplementals? And then also, what does that assume for EFV?
Jay Johnson: I would characterize the weapons systems and ordnance pieces as slow, steady growth as well. And what was your last?
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: EFV.
Jay Johnson: EFV, as you know, is in the SDD 2 phase right now, and depending on what you read, it may or may not be a risk. But we're providing our seven vehicles for the Marine Corps to test. For us, it's about $250 million, I think a year going forward and it's not due to reach an LRIP until '15 or '16. So it's not a major muscle mover in the sense that it impacts us heavily in the next couple of years. So we'll see how it develops within the Pentagon.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Jay, I was wondering if you could give us some color on the timing in the step-up in the G650 production rates over the next few years as you go towards three to four month. And also what should we think about in terms of incremental margins of that mix coming in, even in '11 and beyond?
Jay Johnson: Myles, first of all, let me just say, since you opened the 650 door, let me just say that we're very pleased with what's happening with the 650 right now in test. We've got four in flight test right now in all corners of the flight envelope. They're performing exceptionally well. We're very pleased, so we're on track, okay? Now then to your specific question, I believe, you've heard me say before that in terms of production rates and margins, I'm a little less fulsome than you would like me to be at this stage, because we're just not into full-rate production yet. But I would report that -- and you know the facility we have and you know the production capability and capacity that we built into this airframe, so we're very bullish for the longer term. But right now, I'm going to stay with 17, 33 and 33 for production in '12, '13 and '14, and the margins will be respectable margins, but growing as we mature that program. And I'm very bullish on the longer-term margins for the 650. It's going to be a game buster airplane for both the customer and for Gulfstream.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Would the margins be accretive or dilutive to the mix that you currently have?
Jay Johnson: I would suggest, I mean, just based on -- I don't know. I mean, because we're not there yet as I said before. But I would suggest that relative to the large-cabin, in-production aircraft, they're probably going to be maybe slightly dilutive to that at the start and come through it as we mature. So that's an early peek.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Campbell with Barclays Capital.
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: Actually, it's Carter Copeland. Quick question regarding Jet Aviation and the improvement you noted there. I know you, at one point in time, in terms of completion, had some airplanes that were challenging to say the least, and I think that was weighing on the margin in that business. I wondered if you might provide us some more insight into what exactly is going on there to help out in terms of improving the completions margins and what -- and how far you've progressed in terms of improving the profitability at Jet? Where do we stand in that process today?
Jay Johnson: We're progressing as we hope to progress. I'm very pleased with the completions performance that we're getting out of Jet right now. I mentioned in my remarks about going to see our European businesses. I did that on the European Land Systems side. And I also went to Basel and Zürich, and spent some time with Jet and went through some of the completion aircraft, et cetera. So I would report that steady progress has been made. We have indeed worked very hard on the front end processes for our Completions business and it's taking the desired and necessary effect. The other remark I'd make, and you know this, Carter and Joe, but when you step into something like these wide-body, narrow-body completions, it's not a two-month deal. These projects go for a long time, years in many cases. So working through that inventory, the legacy inventory and getting them back in the air and return to their customers in good shape has been an ongoing evolution, and in fact, it still goes on. But I would tell you that they've definitely turned a corner. And the future looks very bright in the Completions business, both skyline-wise and how we execute on that skyline.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: You talked about Marine and the margins were quite good this quarter. But you're facing challenges at NASSCO in terms of volume and you're going through a transition at that. Could you talk about what you need to do to keep margins? I know you've said that they'll come down a little bit. But what are the things you're doing to try and keep margins as high as you can in those situations?
Jay Johnson: Let's talk about Marine and margins. And you've captured it and I said it in my remarks, I mean, I'm very pleased with the performance at all three of our shipyards. The margins are representative of the excellence of those yards in doing what they do best. And really, the margin guidance that I'm giving is purely reflective of the mix shift, predominantly at Bath Iron Works. But also, somewhat, as we move block to block with Virginia Class, we're now into Block III, I think, as you know, and then also coming to the end of the product carrier line, if you will, at NASSCO. So what does all that mean? In the Bath instance, you know we're in the build on the first cost-plus DDG 1000. It's about, I think, like 17% complete, okay? No big surprises. We're pleased with what we've got. We like it a lot. We're in contract negotiations for the next two fixed-price 1001 and 1002 by hull number. And so that will work itself through. And so you'll see the DDG 1000 that's in the build becoming more of Bath's portfolio here as the year advances, and the DDG 51s, the mature fixed price, we know how to build these babies better than anybody. And you'll see all of that tailing down a little bit as the last two boats are in the build right now and the next one comes in, on the '11 budget, DDG 115 by hull number. Beyond that, the DDG 51s will arrive in some number. But it's just not parsed out in the budget beyond the '11 budget, as you well know. So the point of all that is you're going to see the margins come down as that cost-plus boat dominates, if you will, relatively speaking, Bath Iron Works. And then as we get into the fixed price, DDG 1000s and back into the fixed-price, DDG 51s, you're going to see those margins go back up again. I would also then comment in terms of Electric Boat, I mentioned the transition that we're still doing with Block IIs, and we're now starting Block IIIs. So the margins, I would expect, as we mature into Block III, I would expect, given that we continue to perform as a team, the way we perform right now, and going forward, we can enhance the margins in Virginia Class. And that's going to be, as you know, the major muscle mover for the Marine group. I would also add in terms of margin opportunity, the SSBN at Electric Boat, and I think you know, we're doing early engineering and development work on the SSBN Replacement, which is timelined into about a 2019 start to replace the Ohio Class SSBNs some years later. But that will also provide opportunity there. At the NASSCO side, you know that the T-AKE 14 in number will complete at the end of 2012. The product carrier's completed at the end of 2010. And that's why I changed the guidance, because the product carriers are going away. And that's a great margin opportunity that will tail out here very shortly. On the Navy side, we've got the MLP coming in on the '11 budget to enhance that side of it as the T-AKEs run out, if you will. And then on the Commercial side, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're very encouraged by the discussions we're having right now. The commercial market is coming back. And I believe that the time's up, the way we think it will, you're going to see contracts here for 2011 in that market, okay? And I'd also comment at NASSCO as it applies to all shipyards, but the most relevant current example is at NASSCO. We manage those businesses for profitability, and we're very disciplined in so doing. We just let go close to 600 people at NASSCO, because the volume was not appropriate to keep them, and we'll continue to do that as necessary, down and up, to make sure that we maintain profitability. So that's probably more than you asked for. But that's kind of my Marine view.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Jay, the backlog, as you pointed out at Gulfstream, is off a little bit, and it looks like it's in the larger jets. Could you provide a little bit of color regarding discussions? And do you think that by the end of the year, book to bill will be back to one?
Jay Johnson: The order book at Gulfstream for this year is essentially where we thought it should be. I mentioned a little softness here in the latter part of the second quarter. I'm not disturbed by that, okay? I could call that just summer softness or seasonal, whatever, however you want to characterize it. But we're already looking, taking orders now in this quarter. So I see the order book pretty stable as we progress throughout the year. I also see the default activity as being very small, as we step through the rest of the year. That's based on what I see right now. So the long and short of it is, I would expect the book to bill to increase as we go forward, Howard.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: I have a question for you on Gulfstream. I want to tear apart a little bit the operations. When we back out Jet Aviation and the used volumes, it looks like the Gulfstream, the manufacturing operations, did about 19.8% margin, which was really solid. And then we look at the reported margins on the first half, you did 16.5%. Presumably, Jet is going to continue to do well. You gave us color on used, and yet you're resuming your 14.5% margins in the second half of this year. So what are the gating elements that are representing headwinds in your mind for Gulfstream going forward?
Jay Johnson: Heidi, let's talk about margins at Gulfstream. Let's see, what's the best way to shape this? I'm going to give you more of the tutorial than you asked for, okay? Because this is the way I've got it stacked in my head. The forfeiture profits, liquidated damages, were not a margin driver for us, because it was as low as it's been since the downturn. So let's just take that off the table at the top. If you look at the margins year-over-year, okay, this time was better, positively impacted, because of the Aircraft Services volume improvement, which I talked to in my remarks, less pre-owned aircraft sales and frankly, those that did sell, sold at a modest profit versus the loss they sold at a year ago. And then the things you'd expect me to say, lower SG&A and then less, unless this is R&D expenditure, because we have larger supplier payments in the quarter, okay? That's kind of the year-over-year up to the 16.8%. If you look at it sequentially against the first quarter of 2010, really the difference there is the R&D expenditure, okay? So that's the lift that they got there. Looking forward for the rest of the year, why am I not sticking my nose up in the 16s, like I think, you're implying in the question? And the answer is we had the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, the overhead absorption attached to that. I do expect the forfeiture profits, the liquidated damages or whatever, to continue to decline, okay, with fewer anticipated defaults in the second half. And I expect the R&D expenditures to increase. Normally, historically, I guess, you'd say, the R&D expenditure net is more weighted in our favor on the second half of the year, and this year, it was favored to the first half of the year. So anyway, I think those are probably the major margin factors I would have for you today.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Just to be clear, Jay, are you saying that the second half of R&D is heavier weighted than it was in the first half?
Jay Johnson: Yes.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: So that -- it sounds like that's then the most significant.
Jay Johnson: Yes, I would say so. I mean, and again, the supplier injects into the R&D, if you will, were more heavily weighted to the first half of this year, which is not the way it usually happens. But it happened this year. So we would expect to absorb more of the R&D in the second half ourselves. All that said, remember that we still sort of sightline ourselves, Heidi, at about 2% of sales for our R&D, and we're roughly in line with that. We go up a little, we go down a little, but that's still the sightline. We're very disciplined about that as you know.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: And then it also sounds like Services can be a potential tailwind as well, as it has in the first half.
Jay Johnson: Yes.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Recognizing that the backlog and order flow for the company can be particularly lumpy, and that you have different dynamics in each of the businesses, if I just take a step back and look at the total backlog of the company, it's declined for, I think, six or seven quarters in a row, the book-to-bill metrics are on the weaker side. Why should I not look at those numbers and translate that to think that the company has an organic growth problem going forward?
Jay Johnson: Well, let me look at it one business at a time. I mentioned in my remarks that I was very pleased with the Combat Systems and IS&T growth and all that is true, better than 1:1 in IS&T and close to it in Combat. If you add the IDIQs to that, it goes in excess of 1:1. So those two, okay, better than okay. On the Aerospace side -- well, on the Marine side, I think you used the word, but I'll use it again, that's the lumpiest of all in terms of how you add to the backlog. It comes in big slugs, and then it doesn't for a while, and then it comes in big slugs again. And what you're seeing right now, quite honestly is the impending, but not yet arrival of the number two or number three DDG 1000. That's really what you're seeing there. On Aerospace, look, it's $17.8 billion worth of backlog. Yes, it came down. But here's the way I look at it, and we look at it. If you take the 650 and give that, let's say, $12 billion of that $18 billion, put that aside, you got almost $6 billion in backlog in your in-production aircraft, largely in the large cabin. That's a very robust backlog. But here's the way I look at it. I look at it in terms of who's in there and how long will it take for you to get in entering the service with an airplane you want to buy today. And the answer to that, in terms of the 450 and the 550 is 18 to 24 months. And in our thinking, in my thinking, that's kind of the sweet spot. If that backlog, given the production rates we have, the fat backlog carries an 18-to-24-month delivery time with it, that backlog is sized appropriately. If it gets less than that, okay, then we got some sales work to do. If it's more than that, then the customer base waits too long for their airplane. So that's kind of where I am with that.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: So on the Defense side in total, it sounds like if you get some of the international stuff you're expecting, to get where you're anticipating the Marine to move some stuff in the firm, we should see better book to bill there in the back half of this year?
Jay Johnson: I would expect so, yes. And as I said, with Marine in particular, we're working those two 1000 contracts right now. And whether that happens late this year or early next year is TBD. But it will happen, and IS&T will continue to be very strong.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Jay, with this changing Defense environment, we've seen a number of companies that consider spin-off to meet and become cases to meet OCI issues, but also focused on perhaps increasing shareholder value. In the last down cycle, when we had the last, last supper, GD was a leader in terms of doing creative things with its portfolio of businesses to create value. Could you give us some thoughts in terms of as you go through over the next year or two, the types of things you might be doing to enhance shareholder value with that way?
Jay Johnson: Well, I think, as you well know, Cai, we focus very much on profitability and enhanced shareholder value around here. One of the ways we do that is to keep ourselves very lean and very efficient. And we, I think, set the standard for that. Our corporate headquarters, I've got, I think, 35 officers in all of General Dynamics, 35 corporate officers. So that's a pretty lean overhead organization. But to your point, we look at all four of our businesses. We look at the diversity of our portfolio. We look at what we're engaged in and what environment we're operating in back to the entrepreneurial agility of my business unit Presidents. They're looking, all the time, to see how they can enhance the portfolio we have in ensuring its relevance, and also looking at adjacencies that may give us more opportunity, or quite frankly, also looking in new areas or harvesting things that are in our portfolio that aren't appropriate for us anymore that might do someone else, something better. And a classic example of that is Spectrum Astro, which we just divested. So that is ongoing work constantly here, Cai. Now in terms of spinning something off or doing something like that, hey, right now, we're getting plenty of value, I believe. And the future is pretty well defined, I think, in all four of our businesses for the short term. For the longer term, we'll see how things develop on the Defense side. But I don't see it appropriate at this time, to do anything like spinning off a part of our business, if that answers your question.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Access 342.
George Shapiro - Citi: Jay, I just want to pursue the Gulfstream margin a little bit more. If you adjust the first quarter for the forfeitures, it looks like sequentially, there's like a 200 basis point margin improvement. Volume's the same. Mix is about the same. So it'll be safe to say hen that sequentially, R&D was actually down by about $25 million? So R&D in the second quarter was pretty negligible?
Jay Johnson: It was down, George. But it was down net. And the reason why it was down net is because we had more supplier R&D provided in the second quarter. Yes, that's the difference.
George Shapiro - Citi: But would the ballpark net like about $25 million?
Jay Johnson: I'm not going to give you that, George.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch: Were you guys actively buying shares during the quarter? And if so, how much did you buy?
Jay Johnson: Yes, and 5.5 million shares.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Jay, you talked about cash flow growing in the second half of the year. And I guess, I'm just looking at where you are to the first half and a pretty sizable use of cash on the customer advances and deposits in the CIP line. And I guess, one, are you still targeting 100% free cash flow to net income at the end of the year? And if some of the international awards and things have shifted out, does that allow you to really get the advances and the deposits that you need to get there?
Jay Johnson: At the midpoint of the year, Sam, my answer is that we always target 100%. And I've got nothing that's got me backing away from that right now. Will it be easy to get there? No, because of some of the things you've said and some of the things I've talked about today. But it's still the sightline we are proceeding upon.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2010 General Dynamics Earnings Conference call. My name is (Shamika), and I will be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions).  I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Amy Gilliland:  Thank you (Shamika) and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics’s first quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimates regarding the company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10-K and 10-Q filings.  And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay Johnson:  Thank you Amy and good morning everyone. General Dynamics delivered a good first quarter marked by strong operating performance across our businesses. Revenues in the quarter were $7.8 billion down from the first quarter of 2009. You may recall that in last year’s first quarter revenues were unusually high. In fact it was the company’s single largest revenue quarter ever.  Unlike last year’s experience we expect sales to continue to increase as the year progresses more consistent with our historical pattern. Operating earnings were $918 million in the quarter, up slightly from last year’s first quarter resulting in an 11.8% operating margin. A favorable program mix and disciplined execution contributed to the 80 basis point year-over-year margin improvement with particularly strong performance at aerospace and combat systems.  Earnings from continuing operations were $599 million, up slightly from last year’s first quarter. This drove 7.7% return on sales 50 basis points better than last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.54 on a fully diluted basis flat when compared with first quarter 2009. Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $150 million somewhat light but better than last year’s first quarter. In the quarter, we experienced some growth in operating working capital at our IS&T in general and at C4 Systems in particular.  This is largely a timing issue that will reverse itself as the year progresses. We should be around 100% net earnings to free cash conversion again this year. First quarter orders totaled $7.2 billion, significantly higher than last year with robust award activity across our business portfolio. Backlog totaled $63.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down modestly from year end. Funded backlog however was up 3% at $47 billion. Total potential contract value which includes backlog, unexercised option in indefinite delivery and definite quantity contracts reached nearly $81 billion.  Now I’d like to focus on the performance of each of our business segments starting with our three defense groups and I’ll begin with the Combat Systems. Sales were $2 billion, down $400 million or approximately 17% from last year’s first quarter. The volume decline resulted from several factors. A significant decrease in MRAP volume when compared with the first quarter of 2009, the absence of deliveries of weapon systems that protects soldiers from roadside explosive threats, lower small-caliber ammunition volume, and last year’s cancellation of the Future Combat Systems program. Higher volume on Abrams, Stryker and several European vehicle programs somewhat offset these decline. Our Combat Systems businesses delivered $269 million of operating earnings in the first quarter. Down just $10 million from last year on significantly less volume. Consequently, the groups operating margin was 13.4%, 180 basis points higher than last year. This performance was the result of a favorable program mix and strong execution on several vehicle and ammunition programs.  Combat Systems backlog declined modestly from year-end to $12.9 billion, despite the decline in backlog award activity was healthy in the quarter. We received new orders on our core programs and also on several new opportunities. These new opportunities include an additional 250 RG-31 MRAP vehicles and MRAP (inaudible) awards beyond the retrofit work we had expected this year.  The MRAP deliveries are scheduled largely in the second half of the year. In March we were selected as the preferred vehicle provider for the United Kingdom FRESH program. This opportunity includes both the Scout variant and the Common Base Platform for up to 580 specialist vehicles. The FRESH program also anticipates several other blocks of vehicles for which we will provide the common base platform. We are working with the United Kingdom on the initial FRESH contract and we expect to add it to backlog later this year.  The FRESH program provides good upside to Combat’s outlook over the next five years. There are several other opportunities that could generate additional awards this year, including the Canadian lab upgrade program for which we expect to receive a contract in the second quarter and the Spanish eight by eight vehicle competition which we expect to be awarded in the second half. Other potential 2010 awards include the ground combat vehicle competition, the next phase of the Saudi Tank program, additional Iraqi tank options and the opportunity to enhance Stryker Combat vehicle protection.  For the year, I expect Combat Systems sales and earnings to grow each quarter. This trend is typical for Combat Systems as the group’s European vehicle business generally realizes a significant portion of annual sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters. Much of the topline growth I’ve guided to for the year comes from international programs including the live FMS program and several European vehicle programs. Our plan anticipates these programs building in the second half.  That said it is worth noting that we have experienced the ways on international programs in the past. While our current international programs are still on track, it is too early in the year to predict uncertainty how they will unfold. I remain comfortable with the earnings implied in my guidance for the group, although they could come from slightly higher margins and lower revenue than originally forecast.  Marine Systems, the Marine Systems group had a solid first quarter. Revenues were $1.6 billion in the quarter, down very slightly compared to year ago. Operating earnings were $161 million and operating margins were 9.8% essentially flat when compared to first quarter 2009. This margin reflects improved performance on our auxiliary ship programs and negative mix shift in our surface combating programs as DDG-51 work declines and DDG-1000 volume increases.  Marine’s backlog totaled $22.1 billion at the end of the quarter, down slightly from year end 2009. We added orders for two T-AKE’s in the quarter as well as long leave funding for another DDG-51 destroyer. I anticipate orders for two additional DDG-1000 later this year which will again increase the size of the backlog. Marine Systems will see growth in volume as the year progresses, although mix shift in the Destroyer program will continue to pressure the group’s margins. Given their excellent execution to-date however I think there is a chance that they will outperform by mid 9% margin guidance for the year.  IS&T, the Information Systems and Technology Group began 2010 with their largest sales quarter ever at $2.8 billion. Earnings were $290 million and operating margins were 10.5%. Margins were particularly strong at our IT services business which enjoyed a favorable program mix in the quarter. IS&T’s backlog was $10.3 billion at the end of the quarter and once again the group achieved a book-to-bill of one times.  This reflects continued demand for the group’s products and services particularly in light of their robust first quarter sales. this quarter’s order activity was very strong at our tactical communications and IT services businesses reflecting our success in capturing business in faster growing market segments such as tactical networks and communication, healthcare services, simulation and training and IT infrastructure. We had a number of notable IS&T awards in the quarter, some of which you’ll find at exhibit G of our press release. Work on these contracts will help drive the group’s revenues this year especially in the second half.  IS&T’s estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contracts grew 3% in the first quarter to $13.2 billion. When combined backlog and estimated potential contract value totaled $23.5 billion providing IS&T ample opportunity for continued growth. IS&T remains well positioned to achieve my guidance of approximately 8 to 9% sales growth in mid 10 margins this year.  Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace Group is off to a very good start in 2010. when compared to last year’s first quarter the group’s revenues were down 6.7%. However first quarter 2009’s results reflected a higher annual production rate including three additional green deliveries and 17 additional completions. Of those 17 additional completions 15 were mid-cabin aircraft. You may remember that we reduced Gulfstream’s annual production in March of 2009 as a result of the change in market conditions.  The most significant production cut was in the mid-cabin aircraft. On the other hand, first quarter revenues were $1.4 billion, up nearly 15% over the fourth quarter of last year, due to additional Gulfstream new aircraft volume. Gulfstream green deliveries in the first quarter included seven additional midsize jets when compared to the last quarter and one additional large cabin aircraft.  The groups operating earnings were $218 million and margins were 16.1%, improved when compared with both last quarter and the prior year period. Last year’s cost cutting efforts helped to drive some of the margin improvement in the quarter. We continued to see gradual improvement in the business aviation market in 2010, including healthy customer interest particularly for our largest jets. We also see declining pre-owned inventory levels and healthy aftermarket demand.  Gulfstream enjoyed their largest order intake since mid 2008 in the first quarter with international orders dominating the order book. Orders were representative of every major international region and demand was particularly strong for our large cabin aircraft. Gross new aircraft book-to-bill was 1.2 times on a dollar denominated basis. Despite green take, new aircraft deliveries in default activity led backlog to decline modestly from year end to $18.5 billion.  Orders outpace defaults for the fourth consecutive quarter and with continued economic recovery, I expect orders to increasingly outpace defaults as the year progresses. Pre-owned inventory levels continued to decline. We sold three pre-owned aircraft this quarter, took none in trade and have one aircraft remaining in inventory. For the remainder of 2010, we have no more than four trading commitments. Aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul demand was solid in the quarter although the first quarter does tend to be somewhat lighter than other periods of the year.  Jet Aviation’s global FBO aircraft management and charter businesses were particularly strong. As we expected it appears the groups services business will be up for the year in the low to mid-single digit range. We continue to make great strides in our product development programs in the first quarter. Both the G250 and G650 have two aircraft in flight test at this time and we are extremely pleased with the results we’ve seen.  Certification plans for both models remain on-track. For the year, we remain on pace to achieve our delivery plan which includes approximately 77 large cabin aircraft and 14 midsized. Large cabin deliveries will be slower in the third quarter as we are planning a two week furlough at Savannah. Slight improvement in the mid-cabin market could provide upside to plan deliveries. I remain optimistic on the outlook for the business aviation market and am encouraged by the generally positive trends we’ve seen thus far in 2010.  Aerospace is well positioned to achieve low to mid-single digit sales growth with some upside to the 14% margin guidance I’ve provided. With regard to capital deployment, our solid balance sheet affords us ample flexibility to enhance shareholder returns. In the quarter we continued our balance strategy repurchasing 2.9 million shares at attractive prices. We also expanded our tactical communications portfolio with the acquisition of a software company that facilitates battle field information collection and dissemination for soldiers, a capability at the forefront of defense spending priorities.  The Board also increased the quarterly dividend by 10.5%. The 13th increase in as many years. In summary, we’ve hit the deck running in the first quarter and we’re on our way to another successful year. The year is still young, so I am going to reiterate my full year guidance to 640 to 650. I think I’ve provided some indication of where I believe there maybe upside to that guidance, but it would imprudent to make any adjustments at this point.  The improving business jet market and 2011 defense budget request provide a good foundation for the company moving forward. And with that, I’ll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on several key financial highlights, Hugh.
Hugh Redd: Well thank you Jay and good morning everyone. Although interest expense was up for the first quarter compared to a year ago, we expect full year interest expense to be down slightly from 2009 somewhere between $150 and a $160 million. This estimate of course does not assume any extraordinary capital deployment activities throughout the remainder of the year.  Over the past 12 months we’ve cut our net debt, by net debt I mean debtless cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We’ve cut our net debt in half, from $2.6 billion to $1.3 billion. This improvement can be attributed to our strong cash performance that comes after deploying Fox shipment, $700 million in acquisitions of new businesses, $600 million in payment of debt dividends – excuse me, in payment of dividends, $500 million in company sponsored resource and development, $400 million in capital expenditures and $300 million in share repurchases.  Over this period our debt-to-equity ratio has dropped to 30.2% from 37.8% and our debt-to-capital ratio is 23.2% down from 27.4%. our next scheduled debt repayment is $700 million of fixed rate notes due in August of this year. Finally I would also like to remind everyone that we planned to make a bona fide contribution to our pension plan of about $217 million in the third quarter of this year. That completed my remarks, Amy I’ll turn it back to you to begin the Q&A. 
Amy Gilliland:  Thank you. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. And (Shamika) if you could just please remind participants how to enter the queue. 
Operator:  Sure. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Good morning. 
Jay Johnson:  Good morning, Rob. 
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Jay could you talk a little bit more about the flow in Combat as you progress through the year, you certainly started to in your monologue but you really do need to see some kind of substantial ramp to get to the revenues and I do note that you said you might not quite get there, but how should we think about that relative to the margins as well, where it looks like we’ll see some decline, how should we think about the mix and the flow? 
Jay Johnson:  I think the way I’d characterize it Rob, at the top is that our core programs are stable and have some potential to build as the year progresses and I would relate that specifically to Stryker. But the big growth if you will as the year progresses will come as I alluded in my remarks from the international programs and we have a number of those as you know. So it will be gradual as it usually is, heavily weighted if you will to the third and fourth quarters which is not at all unusual for Combat Systems but fairly substitute in its elements across both US franchise and international, that’s the general description I would offer. 
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Without ask you to go too far into the future, would you say this is going to be the most revenue challenge segment over the long term, but of course we’d see upside or off side I should say from aerospace and elsewhere? 
Jay Johnson:  I got to say Rob that I pump the answer a little bit in the following way, what I see there is potential for that, but what I see for example in the 2011 budget summit is very strong support for the US franchise programs, AKA Stryker, Abrams. We’ve got grand combat vehicle competition that will lay itself out later this year, JLTV is still playing, Stryker is in play right now, reset modernization all of those elements is not just new production. So it’s multifaceted and very robust as we forward. So I don’t see a big tail off if that’s perhaps the implication here, because our core programs are being very well supported.  We also have on the international side things that perhaps more realities the last time we talk like as I mentioned in my remarks the FRESH contract which will be significant add to the portfolio for Combat Systems. 
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Jay, thank you very much. 
Jay Johnson:  Okay. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Macquarie. Please proceed. 
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Good morning. 
Jay Johnson:  Good morning. 
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Jay I was wondering if you could go to aerospace and if you could comment on the operating margin in the quarter, it’s clearly coming ahead of your full year guidance. Has it been any unusual items in this quarter? 
Jay Johnson:  Okay, we’ll talk about aerospace a bit. To your point on margins, I started off by saying I am very pleased with the performance that aerospace both in Gulfstream and in Jet Aviation. So let's just get that on the table at the start and it’s reflected in the margin performance that you saw. There are several thing, have been several things that play in realizing those margins relative to both year-over-year first quarter ’09 and the sequential from last quarter, example year-over-year our margins this quarter were positively impacted certainly by mix as I mentioned I think in my remarks. So we have 15 fewer midsized completions this year than we did last year.  Also we had a – we didn’t have pre-owned charges this year which we had last year. And as is usually the case when we’re talking about aerospace here, they lowered their SG&A this quarter through great discipline, continuous improvement in cost savings. So those are three I’d say elements that differentiate this quarter from year ago quarter on the margin side.  Let's talk about sequential now from fourth quarter ’09 to first quarter ‘010 and the positive influencers if you will are somewhat different this quarter. I’ll leave the lower SG&A in there because indeed that made a big different again this quarter as it did in the year-over-year comparison but we also had improvement in Jet Aviation which is consistent with we’ve been telling you was happening and would continue to happen. We saw that quarter-over-quarter here and we’re very pleased with that and I would also say as I mentioned in my remarks I think that we did have some liquidated damages.  So that’s kind of the summation if you will of elements that I think impacted the differentiation quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Now that said I would caution not to get too far ahead I mean on margins this year because we have something’s to thing about going forward. One is that we are planning a furlough at Gulfstream in the third quarter, not as long as we had last year but nonetheless we’ve got a furlough in the plan which will impact us and also the midsize mix is still a little bit uncertain in all of this, it depends on how the market recovers, depends on how many completions etcetera, etcetera. So that will definitely have an impact, it could definitely have an impact on the margins going forward.  And then I would also say that we expect the liquidated damages to be less of a factor going forward and we can talk about the backlog later but in point of fact what we see didn’t surprise us and we see less of it in the next and subsequent quarters going forward. So that’s probably more than you asked for but that’s kind of my rundown on the margins side and I hope it’s responsive to your question.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: That’s great, thanks very much Jay. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Co. Please proceed. 
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.: Yes, thank you Jay. 
Jay Johnson:  Good morning Cai. 
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.:  Looks like your cancellations were, yes hi, looks like your cancellations were up a bit from the fourth quarter at about billion, can you give us some color on A, what was the size of the LD in the quarter and kind of where do the cancellations come from and kind of what’s your prospect for cancellations over the next couple of quarters? 
Jay Johnson:  You bet, I would be happy to. First of all, in terms, I’ll just go in terms of orders and defaults, just sort of lumping together here, the way I got it stacked in my head. It was on the order side, the best quarter we’ve had since the third quarter of 2008, across the product line and as I mentioned orders did outpace default for the fourth consecutive quarter. So we feel very good about that. $18.5 billion is a very robust backlog by any measure so I feel very good about that even though it moves around a little bit. Now the default activity in this quarter, we’ll talk about it little. A couple of things, for example it was greater than, it was the quarter before when we surprised by that honestly, not really, OK? And here are couple of reasons why.  Let's talk about 650. we had actually by number five 650 defaults in the quarter, OK? They were all tied to the -- you recall the first flight payment milestone, anyway that’s the fourth quarter event that manifested itself in activity in the first quarter. So we lost five of those, not surprisingly they were instantly back filled and we’re still taking orders in the 650 backlog is still just south of 200 aircraft. So but it did in fact impact us on the liquidated damages side.  In addition to that Cai, we had a number of defaults frankly that we've been working with the customer for a while and you could have brought some of them to default in the fourth quarter and end the year, we got payment milestones moved to the first quarter. And so some of that just triggered as a result of timing and folks we've been working with for a while. So, again, not a big surprise.  Having said all of that, as we told you before Joe Lombardo, Larry Flynn, the Gulfstream team and I spent a lot of time together going through the backlog, customer by customer and we still do that almost weekly. And what we see ahead of us is an order book that is still very robust and a default activity that would decrease as the year progresses and I would expect spread between orders and defaults to continue to increase as the year goes forward. I hope that answers your question.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.: Except for the amount of liquidated damages in the quarter.  Jay Johnson  No, I won't provide that to you this morning, sorry. 
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.: Okay.  Jay Johnson  But it was not -- I mean it's not the highest nor the lowest we've ever seen, I mean it's kind of in the middle and if you took some of the actions that I described that became first quarter events that were kind of actually could have been fourth quarter events I could almost draw you a straight line across the last four quarters. 
Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran of Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed. 
Richard Safran – Buckingham Research Group:  Hi good morning. 
Jay Johnson:  Good morning. 
Richard Safran – Buckingham Research Group:  I think you first -- I'm thinking maybe you touched on this at the very beginning but on combat systems, book to bill still less than one it was below one for 2009 and I was wondering if you looked out beyond 2010, if you can comment on what you think that might mean for sustained growth of combat systems and I think one of the things, I think you were saying is that look you're expecting book to bill maybe to improve later on in the year possibly driven by these increased European orders. Is that essentially correct?
Jay Johnson :  Yes it is, you got it. I mean we see again in the U.S. franchise programs there is opportunity for growth, okay. They're stable as they can be right now but there is growth opportunity particularly with the other elements that we talked about like reset, modernization vehicle improvements etcetera. But on the international side indeed that is a portfolio that will build as we go, we can see it. I just can't time it out to the day that's the reality and it's not a surprise.  So, we can talk about backlog a little bit just as it applies across the corporation. It's not a one size fits all package; what do I mean by that? Let's just talk about the defense businesses. The aerospace backlog we talked about but in the defense businesses you've heard us say before I think in the marine systems group, the backlog is very lumpy and we usually talking big lumps when they come, okay. We're at $22 million or so right now and when we don't have the next two DDG-1000s in the backlog yet etcetera, you understand that. 
Richard Safran – Buckingham Research Group:  Yes. 
Jay Johnson :  On the IS&T side relatively speaking, it’s pretty steady eddy, okay. Now that over simplifies how difficult it is to sustain a 1X book to bill as they're very good at doing but they're very disciplined and very accomplished with that. So that's pretty steady. On the combat side, it's almost in between those two that I just described but it tends to come particularly when you see some of this international business in pretty lumpy orders. So all that said, we can see a lot out ahead of us but how it comes and in what size lumps I think is something we're just going to have to work our way through. But clearly for combat systems, the bill will be throughout the year and the programs that we see on the international side, for instance I mentioned the labs in Canada, there's another vehicle competition that we anticipate in Canada called the Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle that we're partnered with Oshkosh that will realize itself we believe based on what they're saying now.  Next year and stream out for several years, we’ve got the FMS Labs at great scale, $2.2 billion that are just coming into design work right now that will play out for the next several years. We have got more labs from that customers country that we believe will come in the second half of this year. We've got Iraqi tanks, we've got Saudi Arabian tanks. So there's lots of business that we can see building over the next five years probably longer than you wanted. 
Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Broadpoint Gleacher. Please proceed. 
Peter Arment – Broadpoint Gleacher:  Good morning Jay. 
Jay Johnson :  Good morning Peter. 
Peter Arment – Broadpoint Gleacher:  Thanks for all your great color on Gulfstream but maybe you could just give us an update on the flight testing of G-650 and the 250, how things are going there? And then also just the overall activity on the 250, you got about 15 months I guess before you're going to start maybe delivery? So any color there would be great. Thanks. 
Jay Johnson :  Okay, I alluded to -- I mentioned it in my remarks but I would just tell you that we're doing lots of flying on both sides of the ocean with the 250 and the 650. They're in all corners of the flight envelope and we love what we see. That's the best way to say it. These are sweet machines. We are not being surprised by anything and the pilots can't get enough of them. So as a pilot I'm envious.  Anyway, those programs are proceeding as they need to. Right now I think we'll have the third 650 flying here within a matter of days if not weeks. So all those preceding at pace for certification next year and I see no speed bumps in our way at this point.  The 250 order book honestly is a manifestation of the mid cabin market. So it is not robust at this point I would tell you but I'm okay with that because as you mentioned we've got 15 months until it becomes an entry into service reality. And when people see, touch and fly in this airplane, they won't be able to get enough of it. So that is my profound belief and it also will give us the pacing right now, puts us I think in good shape to match the market as it recovers, the mid cabin market recovers because we are seeing activity in that market and I think you're hearing that from the other OEMs as well. 
Peter Arment – Broadpoint Gleacher:  Yes absolutely, thank you, Jay. 
Jay Johnson:  Okay, I might add one other thing to that Peter is that we don't build flight tales on the 250s because we match demand with supply but we're very excited about the 250 as we are about our 650 and I believe the sales will become very robust, it’s just not time yet. 
Operator:  You have a question from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. 
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Securities:  Good morning. Jay, if I just think about everything you said so far other than combat coming in, you're saying sales could be a little bit lighter over the course of the year but margins higher. It sounds like marine is ahead of expectations there, aerospace is ahead. Perhaps interest is a little higher than you might have said in the past. But I mean what else causes you concern? I know it's only the first quarter but what causes you concern as you look towards the remainder of the year. 
Jay Johnson:  Well, I guess, Sam, the timing in combat if there is a concern as I've talked about that maybe an issue but it's not a long term issue, it's not something I can control to the day. But other concerns, I mean if we have an economic relapse that would certainly impact us but right now what I see of the year and what I see of the defense sides, budget based on the submit for next year and still looking at the fit up as the fit up of record, we feel like or I feel like the plan is pretty solid right now and we can execute to that plan and with a chance to beat it. 
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Securities: If I can follow up just a quick question, can you talk about the DDG-1001 and DDG-1002 in terms of, is that still going to be fixed price anything and you can help us in terms of how that discussion is going?
Jay Johnson :  Sure. We expect that contract to be left here in the next couple of quarters, okay probably it'll be a second half. So in terms of impact if you will this year it won't okay, one way or another, it'll really be a ‘11 event but we should have the contract done here within the next couple of quarters. The fixed price is still there okay and we're excited about that so the cost plus boat is in the bill right now at Bath and going very well by the way. We're very proud of the work that's being done on that. So we're waiting for the fixed price boats and the contract will come. We have every indication that we are -- it's on track, it's just moving through the system. Did that answer your question?
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Securities: It does, thank you.
Operator:  You have a question from the line of Joseph Nadol of JP Morgan. 
Joseph Nadol – JP Morgan:  Thanks, good afternoon. 
Jay Johnson :  Good afternoon Joe. 
Joseph Nadol – JP Morgan:  On IS&T, Jay, the organic sales looked like they were negative in the sort of 3% range in the quarter and you had a strong first quarter last year. So some of this might be comp. I'm just wondering that your guidance implies something along the lines of I think 6% organic growth for the year. So you have to be close to 10% for the rest of the year to get there. Any concern there or it's just the comp issue?
Jay Johnson :  No, I mean I think a lot of it, Joe, really is the comp issue. We had – this was our best revenue quarter ever and it comes off of what I'd say was an unusually strong Q1 ‘09. I think if memory serves, it was like 16% better than the ‘08 Q1. So we didn't help ourselves with the comp in that sense but it's really more to me – I feel very good about IS&T right now. They had a great performance quarter as we described. I anticipate more of that for the rest of the year. And the timing of the contracts okay, maybe not as dramatic as I described in combat systems but the sensing will be that that will build again throughout the year as we go forward. So we've got as you know a very diverse portfolio, all elements of that portfolio are very active. We got tactical communications, battle space management, C-Square whatever you want to call it with WIN-T increment two, increment one, increment three is in play. We've got jitters, we've got common hardware/software working there. IT services was very strong as I detailed in my remarks. ISR is still very active. Access is busy within that space for us as we expected and throughout it all we've got cyber at scale. So we're very busy in IS&T, I don't expect that to change. Their year is a challenge but they're up to the challenge. 
Joseph Nadol – JP Morgan:  That C-4 issue that you mentioned that cost you some cash flow, did that cost you some sales also in the quarter and maybe could you give us some different color on how that's going to be resolved? 
Jay Johnson:  As I said in my remarks, we had a little OWC issue in the first quarter and it’s going to work itself out through the year. It's not even worth discussing beyond that except to say it was a timing thing and off we go. 
Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. 
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  You mentioned earlier that you were pleased with the performance of jet in the quarter. I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color around that and how much it’s contributing to the aviation segment. 
Jay Johnson:  Well, you know I am going to keep it at the group level. But I would just tell you that and I just spent a lot of Jet here about a week-and-a-half ago in Europe and took full reports and saw firsthand what’s happening. And Jet Aviation is giving us what we thought Jet Aviation would give us when we purchased Jet Aviation. And we have had some operational challenges at the front end mostly to do with match volume and productivity, okay? But we have that well in hand and they are operating very well right now. And so we are excited about what we see and they will continue to be ever more important contributors if you will to the aerospace group’s contributions, okay? MRO global footprint, it’s becoming – when you look at the – for example, when you look at the Gulfstream order book and look at how global it is, predominantly international certainly this quarter and more than 60% last year international and you look at the Jet footprint, global footprint, the two come together pretty nicely.  So we are very – that’s a long way around me saying I am very pleased with what Jet is putting forth right now and they will continue to improve as we go and become ever more important to the aerospace group.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  Are you seeing a pickup in volume in the business?
Jay Johnson:  Yes.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Yes, good morning.
Jay Johnson:  Hi Heidi.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Hi. A question for you on aerospace. You were talking relatively bullish, but you are acknowledging it’s the first quarter. So can you talk to us about what do you need to see to take the prediction rates up higher and also talk to us about the percentage of slots that are sold out for 2011?
Jay Johnson:  Well, I am very happy, very bullish on what I say on the large cabin. And I think in terms of production to your first point, I think it really is going to be paced by what the mid cabin market brings to us. We can adjust, I can adjust, Joe can adjust the large cabin production somewhat. But we have got a pretty robust plan in execution right now for that, but there is some room I think on the mid cabin. So –
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Actually Jay, I am more referring to 2011. I mean as you look across the metrics in 2010, is ‘11 flattish or are you sort of, do you see cause for ‘11 going higher or what would you needed to see?
Jay Johnson:  Yes, it’s pretty early in year for me to get clairvoyant on that in terms of giving you numbers and I won’t do that. But I will say Heidi, back to my comment earlier about familiarity with the backlog and what we see with our customers, right now, based on what 2011’s backlog looks like frankly from a production standpoint, especially large cabin, I don’t see much change at all, okay? Certainly not on the down.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Great. And then on the – you talked about seeing a decline in SG&A, talk to us about what is the sustainability of SG&A when volumes return?
Jay Johnson:  I mean, we pride ourselves on our my word agility, okay? On the down and on the up. So we will ramp appropriately as the market takes us to different production levels. I mean and Joe Lombardo and his aerospace team kind of wrote the book on that. So we know how to do it very well. We right size the business at the time it needs to be right sized. We are very proud of that and we are very disciplined about making sure we never falloff that.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  What I was trying to understand better was as volumes return, is the SG&A going to come back on a one-on-one basis or have you changed the business enough you are going to get added leverage on the up from what you did on the down?
Jay Johnson:  My answer to that would be to take you to your latter rather than your former statement.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Alright, great. Thanks very much.
Jay Johnson:  Okay Heidi.
Operator:  You have a question from the line of Troy Lahr of Stifel Nicolas. Please proceed.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolas:  Thanks. I am wondering if you guys could help me understand the changes to your LCS partnership and what the future opportunities are for you there on LCS?
Jay Johnson:  Okay Troy. You know that we are – we have delivered LCS to the Navy. We are in the build down at Ostile on LCS-4, Bath Iron Works is the prime, Ostile is the sub. We have submitted – well, the fiscal year ’10 proposals have been submitted and Ostile is priming that for good and sufficient reasons, okay?  What do I mean by that? These ships are being built in their shipyard. They are clearly ready to prime and quite frankly to be as competitive as we could be with the Ostile boats, we felt that having them solo if you will rather than having them and Bath Iron Works in there would make them cost competitive, because you don’t have two yards, you are only working with one. Embedded in all of that for us is the fact that the core mission system of that great ship is ours, okay? It comes from our IS&T team, AIS in particularly and it’s working beautiful and it’s open architecture and we are very excited about that. So that’s a long way around saying we felt that that for this round it was most appropriate for Ostile to prime this. They felt that way and we are in complete alignment with them on that. By the way, it also for round two that the way they are appears set up by the Navy for round two, it also then would give us the opportunity to put – to bid for the second source in 2012 should we choose to do so. But that’s a long way down range. But I hope that answers your question.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolas:  Okay, yes, that's great. And just one other side note, could you just give us the numbers for the sales and the income associated with some of those pre-owned sales on the aircraft side? 
Jay Johnson:  I will make it real easy, it was $31 million, okay? No up, no down, breakeven.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolas:  Great, thanks.
Jay Johnson:  Okay.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jeffries & Company. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel – Jeffries & Company:  Thank you very much. Jay, as we wind down in Iraq and sort of pick up the pace in Afghanistan, it looks like some of your combat business is seeing some different changes in demand. Could you address your comments on small Cal and also on the Chameleon in particular or was there something else that I am just missing?
Jay Johnson:  No, Chameleon was a program that basically it got replaced. I think that’s my non-technical way to describe that. But at any rate, the program is no longer a factor for us as it was initially and that’s what I was alluding to in my remarks. The small Cal frankly was just a contract lying down and that was the impact there.  But the ammunition business is still very robust for us small, medium and large, large and medium propellant the precision stuff. So we are very active. I don’t – I didn’t mean to imply and maybe I painted it that way in my remarks. I certainly didn’t mean to imply that the ammunition business was suffering, because it’s not. We have got a great team and they are doing great work and they have got lots of it to do.
Howard Rubel – Jeffries & Company:  And then could you explain the furlough at Gulfstream? I mean, if business is that good, why do you need to give them a couple of weeks off?
Jay Johnson:  I got your point. The truth of it is it kind of helps us level load the year there. And I guess you could say that you didn't have to do it but we choose to and I think it works for us. At a two week plan right now, I think everybody feels pretty comfortable with that. So, we are going to less some drastically change, we are going to keep that in place. 
Howard Rubel – Jeffries & Company: Just sort of, on the 650, how is – I mean you are talking about the third airplane and there is more to follow. I mean can you – I means it’s early days. Is there any way you can give us an indication of – are the planes starting to show a learning curve and is the factory starting to fill the way you expected?
Jay Johnson:  Yes, and yes. When we get into the discussion about what are the margins going to be and what's the production rate.
Howard Rubel – Jeffries & Company: I will leave that for later. 
Jay Johnson:  I will stick to where I have been and that is 17.33, 33 is the production rate I have got stacked in my head but we designed that aircraft in that facility for manufacturing as you all know with the 3D (inaudible) of E5, the repeatability, the producibility, the 50% fewer parts, all of that, okay, and the riveting – I mean the bonding versus riveting, all that takes us to a place and by the way, as we go here with the flight test vehicles, we are already making subtle changes to the subsequent vehicles as you would expect – aircraft as you would expect. So, all of that bodes well for great producibility at scale and we intend to do that, it's just not time yet. We got to get ourselves up on the ramp and go more steady state. But we are encouraged by what we have seen, we are facilitized to deal with it, and we have got an order book that handles it. 
Amy Gilliland:  Operator, we have time for one more question. 
Operator:  And your final question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: As I listen to you talk about mid-cabin business jet you sound more positive on that market and I think the last couple of times we have heard. And we just had Cessna report the other day and they talked about seeing some more cancellation activity than expected there and the potential for some downside to their production forecast there and just sort of having limited visibility. I wonder if you could maybe speculated on the difference in tone there? Are you taking a share or is it just at the bottom of the cycle and it’s tough to tell and what's your outlook for this business?
Jay Johnson:  I kind of go with what you just said. I mean it’s a little tough to tell but I mean I can’t tell you from us, I won't speak to the others in the context with numbers and what else, but for us, we are seeing order activity in the mid cabin, not just tire kickers. People are actually buying airplanes. So that's good. We see it in the servicing side of our business where the services have returned, they are not skyrocketing but that's certainly stabilized in the mid cabin for us, okay. So the indicators are tending albeit slowly to a mid cabin recovery and some (inaudible) in the space out there that will bring the inventory back to what I would call right size to go forward. 
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Okay, I am going to try to sneak in one more since I am last, and you haven't been asked about this in a while. Can you update us on your commercial ship building business, what’s the backlog add and what kind of revenue run rate is that experiencing today?
Jay Johnson:  The commercial shipbuilding business which resides as you know out at NASSCO in San Diego, is doing very well in execution. In fact it’s doing superbly in execution. Every product carrier we put out has been ahead of schedule and below budget, okay. So we know how to build those ships better than anybody. That said the challenge there is the market space. And so you know we are building one through five in the product carriers, six through nine are not in the build and right now today’s answer is we don’t expect them to come to us anytime soon. They are not in our plan anymore, okay. But that market too shall return and we are getting some interest in commercial activity that could be resident at NASSCO and I don’t want to get much more specific than that except to say and I think we have talked about this before you have got Jones Act ships that are out there in some number that are getting very old and very tired and very inefficient and frankly, you have got environmental disciplines that are going to be kicking in here in terms of single haul versus double oilers, etcetera, etcetera. So there is a lot going on that will come, it's just a question of when it comes.  NASSCO’s navy side is coming out with 14 T-AKEs which are being done very well as you might expect and that will bring us out through 2012 there. The Mobile Landing Platform is being put into the ’11, we are already doing some of the front-end work on that. And so we expect at least three of those Mobile Landing Platform -- Mobile Landing Ships. And then we also got a significant book of business out there with repair. There is no navy shipyard, okay, in San Diego and there are over 50 navy combatants that need to be maintained out there. So that's – that I think last year was like I don't know 20 some percent, 24% I think of NASSCO’s revenues.  So there is plenty of work in that book of business. The commercial side just needs to have the market come back and we will be very competitive when it does.
Amy Gilliland:  I just want to thank everyone for joining our call today. And if you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3748. Have a great day. 
Operator:  Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2009 General Dynamics earnings conference call. My name is Steve, and I will be your operator for today. (Operator’s Instructions).  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma’am.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics’s fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimates regarding the company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10-K and 10-Q filings.  And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson:  Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics finished 2009 with a very good fourth quarter marked by strong operational performance, excellent cash flow, and the achievement of several key milestones. Sales in the quarter grew $7.9 billion, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2008, but somewhat lighter than I had anticipated, primarily because of timing on several international vehicle contractions and the delayed passage of the 2010 Defense Bill.  Net earnings from continuing operations was $618 million, or $1.58 per fully diluted share. In the quarter we achieved a 12% company-wide operating margin, our best performance in 2009. For the full year, sales were nearly $32 billion, a 9% increase over 2008, driven entirely by our defense businesses. Demand for our defense products and services generated 12.7% top line growth, more than offsetting the 6% decline at Aerospace. Nearly 10% of the growth in our defense businesses was organic.  2009 earnings from continuing operations were $2.4 billion, or $6.20 per fully diluted share. Operating earnings totaled $3.7 billion in 2009 with Combat Systems and IS&T both topping $1 billion of EBITDA. I should highlight that Marine Systems delivered their best ever earnings performance, and Aerospace exceeded $700 million in earnings. An impressive performance in a very challenging market environment.  Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Each of the business groups contributed to this excellent fourth quarter result, which brought total cash for the year to $2.5 billion, or 103% of earnings from continuing operations. This included a pension contribution of nearly $250 million. Fourth quarter orders reached $7.4 billion, the strongest quarter this year. General Dynamics finished 2009 with a total backlog of $65.5 billion, more than two times annual sales. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options, and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity IDIQ contracts totaled $83 billion.  Now I would like to focus on the performance and outlook for each of our business segments starting with our three defense groups.  First, combat. Combat Systems had a very successful fourth quarter. Sales were $2.5 billion, 6.6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2008, due primarily to increased Stryker, Abrams, armor, and weapons systems volume. Double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter was the result of 14.8% margins. 160 basis points of improvement over last year’s fourth quarter. Margin performance resulted from increased booking rates on several of our U.S. and European vehicle programs, and a more favorable mix in our guns and weapons systems business.  For the full year, sales were up 17.7%, compared with 2008, including 12.5% organic sales growth. The group’s organic growth was driven by Stryker, Abrams, and European vehicle volume. The remainder of the growth came from axel caps (ph). While I am pleased with this double-digit growth, I had anticipated over 20% sales growth. The difference is the result of timing on several contract awards and year-end vehicle deliveries. For the year, the group generated operating earnings in excess of $1.2 billion. Margins were 13.1%, 50 basis points lower than 2008 due to mix shift.  Year-end backlog for Combat Systems totaled $13.4, of which $11.4 billion is fully funded. Fourth quarter orders, which totaled over $3 billion, were greater than sales, causing backlog to grow $500 million from the third to the fourth quarter. Foreign military sales contracts were particularly strong in the fourth quarter, including $160 million for a Iraqi tank upgrades, $18 million for Saudi Arabia in tank work, and $2.2 billion for light armored vehicles. These international programs will begin to take hold in 2010 with growing volumes over the next several years.  The group also made significant progress towards several future opportunities in the fourth quarter. In early November, our JLTV became the first vehicle to successfully complete Critical Design Review, with our first prototypes due to be delivered to our customer this spring. Additionally, our European Land Systems group, led by General Dynamics’s UK, submitted its FRES bid to provide the British Army’s next generation of reconnaissance Armored Fighting Vehicles. European Land Systems is also bidding on a Spanish program for several hundred eight-by-eight armored vehicles.  For this year, based on the strength of our backlog and continued support for our core programs, I expect Combat systems to deliver 4% - 5% sales growth, with operating margins in the high 12% range.  Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group finished their best year with another very good quarter. Quarterly sales totaled $1.6 billion, a 12.4% increase over 2008, and operating earnings increased 18.2%, to $156 million. This quarter’s double-digit sales and earnings growth is particularly impressive, since the same quarter a year ago saw sales and earnings grow 13.3% and 30.7% respectively, when compared with 2007.  Virginia class submarine and repair volume drove revenue growth and increased booking rates on several programs, drove the earnings improvement (ph). The group’s 10.1% margins in the fourth quarter were up 50 basis points over fourth quarter 2008. For the full year, sales and operating earnings increased 14.5% and 23.2% respectively. Margins for the full year were 10.1% — a noteworthy accomplishment resulting from hard work and sustained discipline execution in all three shipyards.  Marine’s U.N. backlog totaled $22.5 billion, down from year-end 2008 but robust by any measure. We anticipate adding orders for several ships in the first half of 2010, including TAKEs 13 and 14, DDG 1001 and 1002, and advanced procurement for another DDG 51 Destroyer. For this year, I expect Marine Systems sales growth to be between 7% and 8%. Margins would degrade somewhat, maybe in the mid 9% range, as the group experiences some mix shift in its surface combatant work load.   IS&T. Fourth quarter sales in the IS&T group were $2.7 billion, a 2.8% increase over same quarter last year. Margin rates increased 80 basis points, causing earnings to grow 11.5% compared to fourth quarter 2008. Margin improvement was particularly strong at our tactical communications and ISR businesses. Sales for the full year grew 7.6%, while operating earnings grew 7.1%. Organic sales growth was 4.4%. The group’s 2009 margin rate was constant at 10.7%, a very good result. Demand for products across the group’s portfolio continued in the fourth quarter, resulting in over $2.3 billion in new orders.  IS&T’s year-end backlog totaled $10.3 billion, up slightly from fourth quarter 2008. Total potential contract value, backlog, and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contracts grew 12.9% through 2009, to $23.1 billion at year-end, positioning IS&T for another successful year in 2010. Sales growth in 2010 should be between 8% and 9%, while margins will be in the mid 10% range.  Now, before moving to the Aerospace group, let me comment briefly on our overall defense outlook. 2009 was clearly a successful year for our defense businesses. Operation performance was very good, and we will continue to build on those successes moving forward. Execution remains paramount. The 2010 Defense Bill, passed in late December, fully supported our core programs, positioning our defense business for success in the year ahead. Most of our procurement programs were funded in the 2010 base budget, as supplemental funding targeted operations and maintenance requirements. In the coming weeks, we will get more detailed insight into defense funding priorities and requirements for the next several years. I am confident that GD will fare well. Our products are at the center of today’s fight, and we will continue to evolve our offerings to address changing war fighting requirements in a way that is affordable to our customer.  Now, let’s move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group finished an exceedingly difficult year with a solid fourth quarter. Several of the quarter highlights include continued strength in order activity, substantially fewer customer defaults, improved service volume, and the first flights of our new G250 and G650 aircraft.  The group’s fourth quarter sales were $1.2 billion and operating earnings were $167 million. While sales and earnings were down significantly when compared to fourth quarter 2008, sales were up 5.4% and operating earnings were up 33.6%, compared with third quarter 2009. The group’s 14.1% operating margin was up 290 basis points from third quarter 2009 due to a better delivery mix and improved pricing in the services business. For the full year, sales were $5.2 billion, down 6.2% from 2008. The sales decline resulted from fewer green-aircraft deliveries and a 15% reduction in our services businesses, somewhat offset by the addition of a full year of Jet Aviation.  Operation earnings for the year were $707 million and margins were 13.7%. While earnings and margins were also down from 2008, they were outstanding given the environment. These are the earnings of the market leader. Gulf streams (ph) proactive approach to managing production and internally driven cost cutting initiatives protected profitability in an unpredictable and decidedly difficult market.  All indications point to continued market improvement in 2010. The improved trend in flying hours in the third quarter of 2009 held through year-end, and our service centers continued to work full weeks. Pre-owned inventory levels are continuing to decline, particularly for large cabin models. We have four remaining pre-owned aircraft in inventory after selling one in the fourth quarter and taking one in trade. In 2010, our aircraft deliveries include potential trade in options for nine pre-owned aircraft.  Orders outpaced deliveries again in the quarter, and customer defaults slowed significantly. New aircraft, book-to-bill, was 1.47 times on a dollar denominated basis, leading to a slight increase in backlog. Backlog now stands at $19.3 billion. Our 2009 orders were 60% international with great diversity in the customer mix. Given the continued pace of order activity in the fourth quarter and new customer interest, the backlog remains durable.  Our large cabin backlog is essentially sold in 2010, three quarters sold in 2011, and we are already making significant progress in 2012. We plan to produce 77 large green-aircraft in 2010, several more than we produced last year. Mid-sized production on the other hand will decrease to 14 aircrafts. Mid-cabin activity represented around 5% of Aerospace’s 2009 sales and less than 5% of their earnings.  Our product development efforts remain on track in the fourth quarter with successful first flights of the G250 and G650 aircraft. Both aircraft continue to undergo rigorous flight testing in preparation for 2011 FAA certification. Given the success of the testing to date, we believe that the Aerospace group is well positioned to begin delivering the G250 in 2011, and the G650 in 2012. Revenues and earnings on these programs will begin driving growth in 2011.  For 2010, I think it is reasonable to expect low to mid single digit sales growth in Aerospace, with margins around 14%. This admittedly conservative guidance reflects the market as we see it today. IF market conditions continue to improve, particularly in the mid sized market, we have the flexibility to adjust, and I will factor any upside into subsequent guidance updates.  In summary, 2009 was a good year for General Dynamics, and we anticipate continued success in 2010. The guidance I have provided this morning implies mid single digit growth in sales. Margins will be in the low to mid 11% range, causing earnings from continuing operations to grow at a mid single digit rate. I expect earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $6.40 to $6.50. I should note that this guidance does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment. It is purely an operating forecast.  And with that, I will now ask Hugh Redd to touch on several key financial highlights. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd:  Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I would like to cover a few items that impact the comparison of the 2009 results to 2008 and communicate to you our expectations for 2010 in perspective of those same items. First I will mention, I will quote the operating expense you can see on exhibit C and D for the quarter and for the full year, respectively. The increase year-over-year is attributable to increased stock option expense, which we report for the entire company in the corporate expense line. We expect corporate operating expense for 2010 in the range of $95 million. Next, our interest expense is up for the quarter and the year.  Focusing now on the full year. Net interest expenses up due to a reduction in interest income of about $55 million. That was driven by lower market interest rates and lower average invested cash balances during the year.  In addition we issued fixed rate notes in December of 2008 and June of 2009. That increased our interest expense during the year.  Strong cast performance in the fourth quarter reduced our net debt by $1.2 billion, preserving our strong balance sheet and the financial flexibility that comes with it. With the reduction in net debt and the scheduled repayment of $700 million of fixed rate notes in August, we’re expecting our 2010 interest expense to be done from 2009, around $150 million. With regard to taxes, you may recall that our 2008 tax provision includes the favorable settlement of long standing tax litigation. That reduced our provision by $35 million or $0.09 per share and resulted in an effective tax rate at 31.2%.  The effective tax rate for 2009 was 31.5% which was in line with our expectations. I’d expect the 2010 rate to be in the same range. Perhaps up by 20-30 basis points. With respect to our sales outstanding, you can see the diluted count effectively unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2008 to 2009. We did repurchase 1.5 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2009. But that activity was late enough in the year that it had minimal effect on our weighted average share count.  This was an addition to 2.1 million shares repurchased in the first quarter of the year. As Jay pointed out, the 2010 guidance does not assume the impact of future capital format that is including potential share repurchases.  Finally a couple of thoughts with respect to pensions. You’ll notice that the impact that changes in our funded status and several places in our financial results. First, as Jay pointed out, our strong cash generation in 2009 includes contributions of about $250 million to our pension plans. This combined with asset returns of approximately 20% from 2009, improved in our planned funded status by $500 million. This of course had a positive impact on shareholder’s equity which reflects changes in the funded status of our retirement plans. In 2010 we’re planning approximately 207 million in contributions for our pension plans. That completes my remarks. And Amy, I’ll turn this back over to you for a few minutes.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Hugh. As a quick reminded. We ask those participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. And Steve, if you could just remind participants how to enter the queue, please.
Operator: (Operator’s instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed, sir.
Ronald Epstein – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: You didn’t say too much about the 650 in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how flight test is going and how a conversion from the initial deposit to the more permanent deposits has gone?
Jay L. Johnson : Be happy to, Ron. The flight test regiment is proceeding on schedule. No speed bumps that I’m aware of. We’re very pleased with the airplane. The flying qualities are sweet as we thought they would be. And so it goes. I mean, it’s proceeding on track. I would also add, even though you didn’t ask, I could say the same for the 250. Both those programs as far as the flight test programs, their regiments are going, are performing very well. Which was the basis for my remarks that we’re on track.  In terms of 650, the positive activity, Aerospace reported, we reported strong tests in the fourth quarter. And a sizeable amount of that is attributable to the 650 deposits. So we’re very pleased with that. And the backlog remains very low bust at almost at 200 in the queue. So we’re on track with the 650 and looking forward to getting it delivered. 
Ronald Epstein – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Good morning. Just because this has come up on a couple other calls today. As you think about the $4-5% earnings growth in 2010, do you expect that to be similar in each of the quarters or is it more back end loaded as the timing of various programs?
Jay L. Johnson : I think Sam, I’d stay with the later statements you just made. And you can look at us year over year. That’s usually ramp up toward the fourth quarter. So I’d stay with that.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
David Strauss – UBS: Good morning. Jay, on combat systems, you talked about timing on some international contracting lying now. And then the 2010 bill. Have you baked that in then to the 4%-5% growth done for combat? Because I thought you had been talking about before when you had a higher forecast for combat for 2009, I thought you’d also been talking about kind of low to mid single digit growth at combat in 2010?
Jay L. Johnson : Yeah. It’s actually, David, it was more on the low side. And so the answer to your question is yes, we baked it in to that 4%-5%. Whatever moved from 2009 into 2010 is part of that 4%-5%.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Broadpoint. Please proceed, sir.
Peter Arment - Broadpoint : Actually you hit upon my question, Jay with the 650. Thank you.
Jay L. Johnson : Okay.
Operator: And your next question is from George Shapiro with Access 342. Please proceed.
George Shapiro - Access 342: Yeah. Jay, I just want to follow up on David’s question. I mean, if you were supposed to get nearly $10 billion of revenues in combat based on your guidance in Q3. So based on the 4%-5% growth you’re talking about we really have pretty minimal growth over the $10 billion you were expected. So if you could just explain a little bit more how it doesn’t seem like you factored in the slippage out there. Maybe I’m missing something.
Jay L. Johnson : I’m not sure where you’re going with that, George. But I would tell you that the core programs in combat are well supported in the 2010 budget. I mean, as I mentioned in my remarks, Striker Abrams, the international sales which are now 22%, I think, of combat’s backlog, with more to come. So some of the contracts that we had in 2009 actually delivered like between Christmas and New Years. That late in the quarter. So I think the growth as I outlined it is probably very realistic for what we see right now. Am I missing something?
George Shapiro - Access 342: Yeah. Well, I was just trying to figure between the Q3 guidance you figured that combat would grow over 21%. Which would get you between $9-$10 billion. And now if I just take 4%-5% growth on the 9645 that you reported, I get maybe somewhere 10-10.1. So on an adjusted basis it doesn’t look like you’re really getting much growth at all off of what you expected to report. So it strikes me that maybe it’s not all anticipated – or you didn’t adjust the numbers for the anticipation or that something that’s turning out to be slower in terms of growth then what you expected before.
Jay L. Johnson : Yeah. Part of that too – I maybe didn’t complete the last statement correctly. But part of that may have to do with these international orders that have a tendency, as you probably know, to build more slowly. And that plays in this for sure. Your comment, I mean, you look at the international book itself, we’re very pleased with the contracts we’ve received. We believe there are more coming. We can see more out there. And then these will build through 2010 and really get into production in 2011 through say 2014-2015. In that context the international side we’re very bullish on right now.
George Shapiro - Access 342: And then just on the other side, you had said the margin would be 12.5-12.7 on the third quarter. And it turns out to be 13.1. So where did the positive surprise turn out to be there?
Jay L. Johnson : Performance.
George Shapiro - Access 342: Okay. Very good.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research Group: Good morning. Just a quick question on M&A and cash deployment. I think you said that in Q3 you wanted to kind of be opportunistic in 2010. So kind of like a two-parter here, for M&A do you still see attractive deals? Would you consider making a deal for example, for a second or third tier defense company, if you can comment on that? Or should we maybe expect more – an acquisition to expand your commercial footprint?
Jay L. Johnson : Let me put it this way, Richard, in terms of capital deployment, the first priority for us has been and will remain sufficient operational liquidity to do what we need to do. I know you understand that. I’m stating the obvious. But that’s number one.  We’ve got pension, that you mentioned, that we’ll deal with this year in $260-$270 million range. We’ve got dividends which we’re very committed to that the board will deal with again in a couple of months. And we’ve got tactile share repurchases. So the M&A side, we remain very opportunistic and very inquisitive in our search patterns but very selective in what we do. So I would anticipate remaining within the bounds of deals in max of billions to a billion and a half. And where they will add value in our portfolio or fill a gap that exists in that portfolio. And to be honest with you, that covers a lot of territory. Both on the commercial side and within defense space. And that’s about as specific as I’ll get right now, as you might expect.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research Group: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: So, your performance looked pretty good at (inaudible) jets in the fourth quarter. You have $5 million of used be (inaudible) losses. Were there any forfeiture profits where R&D and SG&A lower? How did you get that very robust profitability? And when you talk about conservatism for next year, is that conservatism just in terms of deliveries of midsized or is there performance upside also?
Jay L. Johnson : To the later, I would say, yes to both. We’re always looking for performance upside. And we’re very good at getting it within aerospace Gulf Stream, as you know. And I’m also anticipating performance upside at the Jet Aviation next year. But to the first part of your question, I think what I’d say is it’s probably a function of the mix. 
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Would you explain?
Jay L. Johnson : More heavy. More large cabin and fewer mid cabin. And the pre-owned that we have.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Right. Fewer pre-owned. But I mean, as you look forward for next year, we have more large planes that we did before. We have midsized. So wouldn’t say that there’s definitely more margin leverage in terms of the mix next year?
Jay L. Johnson : That would be expectation. But I’m not willing to put that card on the table just yet. It’s too early in the year.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Good morning. Wanted to ask you about jet aviation a little bit. If we can delve into that. I think last quarter you hinted to the fact what the sales were relative to the tolls, about 25%. And we know that the margins lagged there. Would the price improvement or the pricing improvement, how should we think about current profitability at jet? And what kind of outlook do we have as volumes return?
Jay L. Johnson : As I told you before, I believe, my report on jet would be as follows. We recognize that we had operational challenges at jet. We have addressed those challenges. We have done a great deal to put efficiency and precision into the completions business. Which is a particular challenge. And now we’re starting to see in other facets of jet, MRO, FBO, services, okay, we’re starting to see increased activity, shall we say, as things improve within the market space. So, that’s a way around saying that jet’s margins, I’ve told you before, have been low, single digit margins. But we are seeing and continue to expect and demand, actually, improvement working toward double digit margins at a time, yet to be announced, yet to be realized. Nonetheless, I like what I see at jet right now. And we believe we have a skyline, as they say, of work that will keep us very active. And so jet is going to become a much more robust of our aerospace portfolio within the coming year I would say.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: I was just going to ask you if you had a time frame but that sounds like what it is.
Jay L. Johnson : I mean, I’m expecting from what I’ve asked jet to do this year, I expect them to outperform. And the trending we see right now in terms of debt play performance in the completions business and everywhere else, tells me that that’s not an unrealistic expectation. I’m looking for upside in aerospace and not all of it attributable to Gulf Stream.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: I was going to say, this can lead the Gulf Stream performance given where the base. The base is so low.
Jay L. Johnson : Indeed.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay. And one last question on Gulf Stream. In the 650 order book, are you seeing any sense of cannibalization of the 550 at all so far?
Jay L. Johnson : Negative. Negative. None what so ever. We may have talked about this before. Indulge me for a second, please. We went through with a four and the five. And the price point delta is about the same, 15-20 depending on how you load it up. $20, $15-$20 million. It’s a totally different segments of the market. So there is a different customer out there for the 650.  Now, have we had some 550 people that are interested in 650? I hope so. But we’ve also got the 550 backlog is very robust and very strong. So we see no cannibalization whatsoever at this stage. Nor do I expect any, quite frankly.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Excellent. Thank you, Jay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. 
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Question on IS&T, the book-to-bill had sort of picked up there the past few quarter. And I think this is typically a 4Q loaded segment. But it doesn’t look like you grew much organically in the quarter. And I think it was one of the weaker quarters of the year. Can you talk about what happened there? And I’d also like to get your view on what a budget freeze would mean for a defense company’s IT business?
Jay L. Johnson : Okay. The book-to-bill is still over one to one. I mean, over one we’re looking in IS&T. The reality you just described though, Noah, I think really is function of the impact of continuing resolution in the delay in the budget being approved. Which as you know impacts the IS&T contracting business probably more – as much or more than any of the rest of our business groups.  So, to your last point, the budget freeze, if there is a budget freeze, which we don’t have a whole lot of clarity on yet in terms of what might impact. I don’t see it as a lot here. But it might be in the IT services in some of the non defense related IT services piece. 
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: But sort of need more clarity on it at this point or something.
Jay L. Johnson : Yup. I mean, we see no obvious impact, material impact right now. We’ll see how it develops.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein: Thank you. On marine, could you talk about the lower margins for 2010? You said this was due to mid ship and could you provide some detail on that?
Jay L. Johnson : Sure, Doug. I mean, it’s really if you look at that, ironworks right now, it really comes down to the mid ship attributable to the DDG 1000 in the bill (inaudible). It’s somewhere between 7%-10% complete. There’s a cost plus boat ship. And then DDG 1001 and 1002 will be fixed price. We’re still working the contract on those. But we’ll be moving down to our last DDG 51s because we don’t have the FY 1151 yet. As I mentioned in my remarks, we believe it’ll come, the contract will come this year. So it’s really that mid ship between 1000 cost plus and weaning down somewhat, for now at least, the DDG 51s. And then, frankly, there’s probably a little bit might be attributable out at NASCO as well in terms of how that work mix develops in the coming year as the PCs complete. We’re still working PC 6-9 and so there may be some impact on the TAKE in terms of overhead absorption, etcetera, etcetera. But that’s probably enough. Does that paint it for you?
Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein: Well, two things that I wondered about on this. One was the new DDG 51s, will those be in anyway different enough that could change your margin outlook from what your more traditional out production has been? And then the other part of it was if you look at Electric Boat I know you made some changes and some layoffs there and some new hires. And it seems that there may be some shift there at the margin too.
Jay L. Johnson : I don’t see much of Electric Boat. And what was the first part you asked me about?
Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein: The DDG 51s, if these would be anyway different?
Jay L. Johnson : Yeah. The answer today is no. I guess you read as I do what’s going on in terms of missile defense and what that may mean for DDG 51s down range. And I think all that being shaped right now. But for us we certainly know how to build the 51 and if changes do come to it, we’ll accommodate accordingly. But right now we believe the 2011 DDG 51 will be very much like the ones that we’re in the build with right now. And also, at EB, remember too, we’re working already the SSDN, we’re getting lead engineering development funding for that, engineering services. So there’s a lot going on there. In Virginia class as well as Ohio class replacement. 
Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies & Co. Please proceed, sir.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.: Good morning. A couple of things. On IS&T, could you talk a little bit – I mean, it looks like in (inaudible) you’re growing share. Could you sort of address what kind of success you’re seeing in your bid rates? I know it’s not 100%, but, I mean, you had some notable items where you did some things towards the end of the year. For example, that one would not have expected in the health care area as (inaudible) and I think there’s a few others like that.
Jay L. Johnson : Yeah. I actually think the capture rate, if you will, has been pretty high in IS&T. And I think it was in our release this morning, the contract for IT for the new national capital region, Walter Reed Army, National Military Center. We’ve got IDIQ for (inaudible). We’ve got pretty good capture on most of the program – not most of the programs. But I think significant growth in cyber this year. About (inaudible) billion of IS&T sales are attributable to cyber across, forensics encryption, security info, data networks, data center integration, etcetera. So - help IT. It’s pretty well spread.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.: Okay. Two, change but still talk about the future a little bit. You highlighted the JLTV progress that you’ve made. How do you sort of envision your ability to continue the most serve the longer term needs of the army but also my sense is that the move into Afghanistan and so on is probably stressing the force? And what sort of response of actions are you taking to help the military in that region?
Jay L. Johnson : We are very committed to – as I said in my remarks, adapt to the needs of the war fighter. And that reflects exactly on what you just asked me. So we never accept a striker as being good enough. For example, we’re always looking and we have received and to be honest with you, Howard, I can’t remember, it’s either late 4Q or early in this quarter we received modernization contracts from our army customer to do exactly that. (Inaudible) striker to modernize it. So we continually adapt the platforms in the systems to the fight. That’s a great strength of ours, a great opportunity and frankly an obligation we owe to the troops.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.: And then last, also, clearly the naval industrial base every year seems to be a topic of (inaudible). How do you think about – you address, sort of the issue at Bath. I mean, there’s only going to be three DDG 1000s and so at some point Bath’s going to need some work. And then if TAKE doesn’t receive any kind of a follow on for a command ship that too will be resized. And given the long term nature of the business, what are you doing in those two instances to try to bolster them or improve them both competitively and I’ll say market wise?
Jay L. Johnson: Howard, my simple and straightforward answer to that is one word, perform. And it is our belief that if we continue to deliver platforms and systems on schedule, on or below cost, and that are of quality that makes the customer excited to receive them, then the industrial base discussion puts you at the top of the list and so we're very committed to that at all three of our shipyards. And recall, the DDG51, there may be only one that you see right now, but virtually everything you read and anybody you talk to says okay we have to recapitalize the surface combatant force. What that looks like the customer is still trying to define to a certain extent. That said, it is our belief that bath iron works will be building surface combatants for awhile to come. The key for us right now is to perform well on the DDG1000 class and then deliver it to our customers and let them see what will shape itself out of that and the DDG51. Out at NASSCO, these — let me just back it up. Out at NASSCO I don't think there's any mystery anywhere of the quality of that shipyard. It's very highly regarded by everyone, as it should be. So I believe there will be, and we're a little premature here, but within a week or several weeks here you're going to see an '11 budget and you're going to see a QDR product or parts of one that I think will help us get some more clarity on what particular platforms may be part of NASSCO's future. But on the navy side on the military side the MLP is already being forward funded to develop. We're hopeful that more will come out of that and I think it will, but we're also on the commercial side you've got the Jones Act fleet out there that is ageing and not double hulled in every instance, et cetera, et cetera. So there is a market that is out ahead for that, it's a question of how it shapes itself and when it arrives and that's our challenge to manage as operators out there.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.: Thank you.
Operator: As a reminder please limit yourself to one question. Your next comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Macquarie Research Equities.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie Research Equities: Good afternoon. Jay, I was wondering if you could give us an update on what you think the impact could be on General Dynamics of the US pulling all its troops out of Iraq by the end of 2011? And on the flipside, what could the surge in Afghanistan do to you?
Jay L. Johnson: I think the way I'd answer that Rob is I believe we'll be gainfully employed in either instance and by that I mean if the troops come out in '11 and that's another whole discussion people can have, but to take your question as fact, a reality, if the troops come out at '11 there is still considerable work to be done on the platforms that we've deployed so hard for the last decade almost in Iraq and Afghanistan. So the reset alone, the refurbishment, the recapitalization of that field and armored vehicle fleet if you will be very, very much in our wheelhouse in terms of work to be done we believe. And then also as I said before, we've got another part of the combat portfolio and ELP and land systems that's going to give us considerable and, I believe, we believe, growing business across the domain in Europe and elsewhere. So I don't see the pullout if you will or redeployment as being significantly impactful to us at this stage of the game because we've got lots to do with the kit that's out there and don't forget we also have JL TV in play, we have EFV in play for the 2015-ish timeframe, and an army ground combat vehicle to be shaped and defined over the next few years. So I believe that we'll be very busy.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie Research Equities: Okay. Thanks, Jay.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Good morning, thank you. Jay, can you talk about your confidence in margins in IS&T in 2010? It seems when we look at the trends in IT that we ought to be bracing ourselves for a tougher tease and seize, so does your government reflect anticipation of possibly tougher contract terms, higher standards for award fees, and possibly even lower award fees going forward?
Jay L. Johnson: It does, Heidi. And what you say, I think the trending is there just as you described it. But we're very attentive to the tease and seize going in and we're very good at outperforming in execution so that was the basis really of the margins that we put forward.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: All right. And I'll press more on that offline then, but can you give us color on the discussion and demand for gulfstream coming out of Asia? Give us some sense of what the order book looks like out of Asia in 2009 and what's the outlook in 2010 to 2012? What's your sales team expecting?
Jay L. Johnson: Here's one example to your point. I always talk about the diversity of the backlog in terms of demographic and geographic. In 2009 the backlog, the Asia-Pacific backlog from I believe it's 13% to 23%. So there's definitely increased activity in Asia Pacific.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: And then what your sales force is expecting over the next couple of years?
Jay L. Johnson: I think we're expecting more activity, but as we've talked before it's not one of shall I say instant gratification or I don't want to overdrive our headlights here because we believe the Asian market will continue to grow, but the pacing of that is still somewhat to be defined just based on air space, air fields, FBOs, et cetera, et cetera. But clearly we believe that the market there will continue to grow and we look forward to being a big part of it.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks. I'll let someone else ask a question.
Amy Gilliland:  And, Steve, I think we have time for one more question this morning.
Operator: Then your last question will come from the line of Myles Walton with Oppenheimer & Co.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.:  Great, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. The question on gulfstream, kind of a followup, but even within the largest cabin mix, the 77 versus the 75, isn't the mix in 2010 more faithful within the large cabin towards the 550 in 2010?
Jay L. Johnson: Yes is the short answer. It is. The 550 is very strong, the pricing is very strong. The 450's doing quite well, but if you had to rank them right now the 550 is definitely strongest.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: So I mean what is the pushback on the margin line? Is it high R&D, are we staying at the 2% or is there something else or is it that it's just come down to pure conservatism?
Jay L. Johnson: Yeah, you just said the word. We are being as we usually are at this stage of the year, very conservative and I won't apologize for that.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: All right, thanks.
Jay L. Johnson: Okay. Thanks, Myles.
Operator: And that concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd like to turn the presentation back over to Miss Amy Gilliland.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you for joining our call today and if you have additional questions I can be reached at 703-876-3748. Thanks and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Welcome to the Q3 2009 General Dynamics earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. We will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President Investor Relations.
Amy Gilliland : Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter conference call. I want to remind listeners that as always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimates regarding the company’s outlooks. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10K and 10Q filings. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson : General Dynamics exceeded expectations in the third quarter on very good operational performance. Sales totaled $7.7 billion up more than 8% from the third quarter of last year. We had particularly strong growth across our defense businesses. Our defense portfolio delivered 14% top line growth when compared with the third quarter last year, 12% of which was organic. In addition, their operating earnings were up 14% driven by excellent operational performance across each of our three defense business groups. On the other hand, in the aerospace group, the scheduled five week furlough at Gulfstream caused a double digit reduction in sales somewhat offset by nearly $300 million in jet aviation sales. Margins were better than I expected across the company, particularly on the defense side but frankly the aerospace group outperformed by expectations as well. This business has done an excellent job of cutting indirect costs and managing the business to preserve profitability even in light of the five week furlough. On a fully diluted basis, third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.48. Although down from last year’s $1.59 it was a good performance given the five week shut down at Gulfstream. Third quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $513 million which represents 89% of earnings from continuing operations. Cash was strong across the company including aerospace. I should note that this cash result also includes a cash payment of $250 million to our pension plan. I expect much strong cash generation in the fourth quarter and while we’ve set a tough hurdle for the fourth quarter cash I still believe it’s possible to get close to a one-to-one conversion for the year. Return on invested capital was 18.3%, 10 basis points above third quarter last year. Orders this quarter topped $7 billion, the strongest quarter so far this year with particularly strong activity in our combat systems and information systems and technology groups. At quarter end total backlog was $66 billion, down 2% from the second quarter but up nearly 10% from third quarter 2008. I’d now like to spend some time discussing the performance and outlook for the rest of the year in each of our business segments starting with our three defense groups. Let’s talk about combat systems first. Combat systems experienced double digit growth in both sales and earnings this quarter. Sales were nearly $2.4 billion, a 27% increase over the same period last year. Of that growth, 22% was organic. Organic growth was driven primarily by strength across combat’s portfolio including increased volume on Stryker and Abrams, guns and weapons systems and several European vehicle programs. The remainder of the growth came from the addition of AxleTech to the group’s portfolio. The group’s earnings totaled $316 million a nearly 21% year-over-year increase. Each of the four combat system businesses contributed to the earnings growth with particular strength at Armament Technical Products and European Land Systems. Margins were 13.5%, 100 basis points higher than the second quarter. Margin performance resulted from the group’s strong sales volume and continuous improvement initiatives. With the addition of more than $2 billion in orders, total backlog for combat systems increased slightly to $12.9 billion. Notable contract awards during the quarter included $647 million for production of another 352 Stryker vehicles, $301 million in Stryker contractor logistic support and $160 million for international ammunition. The Stryker orders in the quarter are intended to fill existing customer requirements. In addition to these orders the Army recently announced the conversion of one heavy brigade combat team to a Stryker brigade in the near term. The Army has also discussed addition conversions in the future. We believe the Army will continue to emphasize fielding what is available, affordable and technically feasible while maximizing the use of existing platforms. International vehicle volume including armoured vehicle and tank sales to Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Canada will also begin to grow in 2010 with particular strength in 2011 and beyond. In each of these programs we are continuing to make progress. In Saudi Arabia we received a $7 million contract to continuing engineering work on the tank upgrades and we believe that it is likely we will secure the light armoured vehicle contract by year end. In Iraq we continue to make progress on the sale of 140 Abrams tanks and associated logistics support. In Canada it appears likely that we will see an initial engineering contract on the labs by year end. 2010 will also offer several new international vehicle opportunities including competition to build several hundred UK FRES reconnaissance vehicles, Spanish 8X8 armoured vehicles and Canadian armoured patrol and combat vehicles. Looking forward the group will have its strongest sales and earnings of the year in the fourth quarter due to large part to European Land Systems. For the year sales will be up about 21% over 2008 while margins for the year will be 12.5% to 12.7%. Marine systems group has another could quarter marked by several milestones including deliver of DDG 108 and T-AKE 8, the launch of T-AKE 9, the start of construction on T-AKE 12 and last week’s completion of builders trials for our first LCS. The group’s third quarter sales were up 8% at $1.5 billion. Earnings which totaled $155 million were up almost 11% over last year’s quarter. The earnings growth is particularly noteworthy as third quarter 2008 earnings were up 27% when compared to 2007. Sales and earnings growth was driven by the continued ramp to two per year Virginia-class submarines at Electric Boat, higher repair volume and increased booking rates on several programs. The marine systems group achieved another 10% margin quarter driven by excellent performance at each of our yards but most particularly at NASSCO. The yard’s performance is the result of hard work from the deck plates all the way to the senior leadership team. This stellar execution has also been enhanced in our investment in key facility improvements. Marine’s backlog totaled nearly $23.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, down slightly from the second quarter but up more than 100% when compared to last year. The Navy shipbuilding plan appears to be well supported in the 2010 budget process. Virginia-class submarines, the Trident SSBN replacement program and the third DDG 1000 have been fully funded thus fair in the process. T-AKE’s 13 and 14 for which we already have advance procurement funding were fully supported in the authorization conference bill and in one of the two appropriations bills. Our customer has reiterated the importance of funding both ships this year. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, sales will improve slightly but second half sales will not be quite as strong as the first half of 2009. For the year, sales should be up approximately 15% compared with last year. Given their results to date, I believe that marine systems will achieve 10% margins this year. IS&T enjoyed a very solid third quarter. Sales and earnings were up in each of the businesses compared to last year. IS&T sales were $2.7 billion, up nearly 9% over third quarter 2008 and year-to-date. Organic growth was nearly 6% in the quarter and 6.5% year-to-date. The group’s second quarter operating earnings were $296 million, up nearly 10% year-over-year. Operating margins at 10.8% were 10 basis points better year-over-year and sequentially. This performance exceeded my expectations and was in large part driven by significant margin improvement at our ISR business, Advanced Information Systems. Backlog for the group increased to $10.6 billion because of $3.1 billion in order activity across the IS&T businesses including approximately $340 million in new cyber work and $1.2 billion in orders for IT services for a variety of customers. The groups’ book-to-bill totaled 1.13 times for the third quarter and is a healthy 1.05 times for the first three quarters of 2009. IS&T also increased potential contract value by $650 million this quarter the majority of which will translates to backlog over time. Several key IS&T developmental products performed well in testing in the third quarter including WIN-T, JTRS and the LCS combat system suite. WIN-T increment two which will provide tactical communications on the move and our JTRS hand held manpack small form factor HMS program which will provide significantly enhanced networking capability to the dismounted ground solider. Both performed extremely well in field testing moving both of these products closer to production. JTRS HMS also successfully added the solider radio wave form to our rifleman radio and manpack. A tactical network is at the center of the future development plants and our products are squarely on schedule and meeting all objectives. We also added Axsys to our IS&T portfolio in September. We are very pleased with this acquisition which brings exceptional technologies, strong operating margin and a great opportunity to enhance product offerings in the fast growing tactical ISR space. Axsys will be nicely accretive in 2010. Fourth quarters sales should be up over third quarter but margins will decline. For the full year IS&T is on track to achieve 8% to 9% sales growth over last year with margins between 10.4% and 10.5%. The aerospace group held its own again this quarter despite the five weeks Savannah furlough which significantly curtailed new aircraft volume. As a result, the group’s sales totaled $1.1 billion down $295 million from the second quarter and $252 million from last year’s third quarter. Earnings totaled $125 million obviously driven by fewer deliveries. The decrease in sales drove margin compression at Gulfstream through unabsorbed overhead. Modest losses on pre-owned sales and lower aircraft service margins also contributed to the reduction in overall margins. We have four remaining pre-owned aircraft in inventory after selling three aircraft this quarter and taking in one. This reduced inventory by half to $62 million. We anticipate taking two additional aircraft before yearend. Without the impact of pre-owned, Gulfstream’s margins were 15.5% in the quarter, not bad in this environment. Although aircraft service volume steadied in the quarter, competitive pricing and the deferral of larger, more profitable maintenance jobs continued. I am cautiously optimistic on the outlook for our service business where current demand has returned our service centers to full work weeks. Jets’ sales and earnings were essentially flat from last quarter although the business continues to make tangible progress in their completions operations with noted improvements in both schedule and cost performance. Newly implemented management controls and production discipline are gaining traction. The business jet market has steadied and is seemingly on course towards recovery. Order activity and interest continue to improve with particularly strong demand in international markets for our large aircraft. Orders were stronger this quarter than last, again outpacing customer defaults. On an absolute basis, dollar denominated book-to-bill this quarter was a healthy 1.5 times. This does not include defaults that reflected continued weakness mostly in the midsized market. Backlog remains a robust $19 billion. We are on pace to meet our 2009 production goals. Continued strength in order activity and my weekly review of the group’s backlog also make me comfortable with our initial projection for low 70s large cabin production again in 2010. Large cabin spots are sold out next year. Large aircraft are also sold well through 2011 and in to 2012 for some models which provides upside to 2010 production estimates. Midsized production remains unsettled and may decline next year although order activity in this segment was more promising in the third quarter. That said, mid cabin activity represents a small portion of Gulfstream sales and earnings. Our production development efforts met several exciting milestones last quarter. In late September we rolled out the new G650 aircraft under its own power. One week later we did the same for the G250. These two aircrafts are completing preparations for first flight and I expect them both to fly before yearend. We are encouraged by the success we’ve enjoyed thus far with each aircraft. The group sales will grow approximately 16% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and earnings should grow faster. For the full year, sales will be down approximately 4% while operating margins will be between 13.2% and 13.4%. In summary, General Dynamics continues to perform very well and is positioned to have a good fourth quarter. For the year we anticipate sales growth of 11% and operating earnings margin slightly in excess of 11%. I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $615 to $620, an increase from my prior guidance. At this time I think it’s more likely to come out at the lower end of that range and frankly, anything north of $620 at this time I think venturesome. We’re now in the midst of operations reviews for next year. I’m not prepared to provide 2010 guidance today as is our practice every year to do it this way. The defense environment remains extremely dynamic as the administration continues to contemplate our nation’s strategy in Afghanistan, the 2010 appropriations and authorizations bills proceed through congress and the pentagon wraps up the quadrennial defense review in anticipation of the 2011 and future years defense program budget submission. Thus far, GD’s programs have received solid support in the 2010 budget process. While we await outcome of these reviews, it is clear to me that the fundamental need to fully equipped our forces has not changed. The world is an increasingly dangerous place and our armed force must have modern and capable systems in sufficient quantity. Secretary Gates continues to emphasize the importance of slow and steady growth in the defense budget with a focus on investing in 75% solution weapon systems that meet requirements across a broad spectrum of threats. In this tough fiscal environment, the equipment that is most relevant to the war fighter will prevail. GD’s products are at the center of today’s fight and we continue to evolve our offerings to provide incremental capabilities that enhance war fighter effectiveness and make fiscal sense for tax payers. In short, I am confident our defense programs will emerge well supported from current budget considerations. As I look to 2010, I can tell you that the defense businesses already have a very solid book of work next year and the recovering business jet market provides some upside opportunity for aerospace. Our diverse portfolio, strong balance sheet and commitment to earnings and cash generation position us well to provide relevant products for our customers while creating significant shareholder value. With that, I’ll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on several key financial highlights.
L. Hugh Redd : There are a few items I’d like to draw to your attention in our third quarter results. First, in operating earnings as detailed on exhibit C to the earnings release you’ll note corporate operating expense of $18 million for the quarter. This is net of a $5 million gain on an asset sale. I expect corporate operating earnings for the fourth quarter to be in the $22 million to $23 million range which is more consistent with prior quarters. The second item is the other expense of $6 million in the quarter. This relates primarily to transaction costs associated with acquisition activity. As you are aware new accounting rules which took effect this year require acquisition costs to be expensed rather than included in the purchase price. Next, net interest expense was up $29 million in the quarter and up $75 million for the first nine months. Interest expense was higher due to a $3.1 billion increase in net debt over the past year resulting from acquisitions and share repurchases. Interest expense was $40 million for the quarter and so far this year we are averaging about $39 million per quarter. Accordingly, I expect net interest expense for the full year to be closer to $160 million rather than the $150 million I had previously given you. Finally, I would like to point out that the effective tax rate for the first nine months of the year is 31.3% which is in line with our expectation of a 31.5% rate. I continue to expect the full year rate to be within 10 basis point plus or minus of 31.5%. That completes my remarks and Amy I’ll turn it back to you to begin the Q&A.
Amy Gilliland : As a quick reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions please get back in the queue.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Jay, you talked about jet, can you give us an update? You talked about progress but can you tell us what kind of margins you’re realizing now and where that is expected to go as you look ahead in to 2010? Maybe you can flush out thoroughly but the puts and takes for 2010?
Jay L. Johnson : I mentioned in my remarks and I’ve told you before that jet, we’re working through some operational challenges at jet aviation. That’s still an accurate statement but as I also said, the progress we’re making is very tangible and we go over there once a quarter over to Basel to observe and learn. I would tell you that right now obviously they’re single digit in their margins. I’m very confident that we’ll take jet aviation to double digit margins, I am very confident of that. But, if you ask me to put a timeline on it, I’m not going to do that for you today. It’s slow, it’s steady. As you know a lot of the work they do particularly in the completions, the wide body narrow body completions are huge projects that take a long time to work through. Patience in one sense is the order of the day but the sideline is very clear and the progress is very steady. The MRO business, the FBO business is beginning to see the trending back upward that I described a bit earlier so we have good downrange confidence there. Jet is a great addition to our aerospace portfolio and I’m very confident in going forward. The completions business will be very strong and I’m looking for great steady progress throughout the next year.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Marine had some pretty nice margins again this quarter. Was there any onetime cumulative catch up adjustments in the quarter.
Jay L. Johnson : No, no, not at all. It was just good work all across all three yards.
Operator: Your next question comes from Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein.
Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein: On Gulfstream when you say that you are sold out on large cabin for 2010, what does that mean? Sold out on what level? I know you’re looking for something in the low 70s but presumably that would be sold out at the higher rate you use to discuss before?
Jay L. Johnson : Let’s just say that the backlog that I track every week with the leadership at Gulfstream, the state charts we go through, I’ve got a green box in every aircraft slot. I’ll just stay with the production numbers that I’ve given you that say we’re going to be in the low 70s next year with some potential upside and I’m very confident with that.
Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein: Then on the G250, give the weakness you’re seeing in the midsized, how are you looking at that? Have you firmed up at all your outlook for what deliveries might be for that airplane?
Jay L. Johnson : It’s a little bit soon for me to really worry about that and worry is not the right word but it’s not in the center of my radar scope right now. I mean, we’re taking orders for the 250, we’ve got first flight this year, it’s a late ’11 arrival entry in to service. So I’m confident if you look at the market that’s out there and the movement we’re starting to see even in the mid cabin [inaudible] prior owned sales and the white tails that are out there I think by the time we get to where orders are really important to the 250 we’re going to be in the sweet spot.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Could you talk a little bit about the backlog shrinkage at marine? You talked about funding for T-AKE 13 and 14 and how you expect backlog to flow? And, perhaps a couple of comments on how the commercial business is tracking? Finally, do you see any vulnerabilities in the long term shipbuilding plan?
Jay L. Johnson : Rob, the marine backlog I’m sure you’ve probably heard Nick say this and probably heard me say it too, tends to come at you a little bit lumpy from time-to-time but it’s a very robust backlog and we’re quite comfortable with that. I would tell you that – let me just review it a little bit. The DDG 1000, the first one is in the build up at Bath, I think everyone knows that. We’re working the contracts on the second two as we speak. The DDG 51, we’ve got three in completion up at Bath right now and we’re looking according to the earlier statements by the Sec Def we’re looking for a 2011 DG 51 there. So Bath’s got plenty on their plate in addition to the LCS down in [inaudible] where Bath is priming right now where we’ve got independents as I just mentioned in my remarks. Those completed builders’ trials last week, they do Navy acceptance trials next month and then on we go. The second one is in the build down there, we’re redoing the contract for the Navy right now on the next 10 and so it goes. But, that’s a 55 ship program still by the Navy’s requirements statements. Electric Boat, you know we’ve accelerated and that’s part of the margin discussion earlier, we accelerated the Virginia-class in to the first half of the year, perhaps a little bit more. That’s why again, it’s just timing and flow but we’re very busy on Block 3 and Block 2 completions up at EB with our partner and we’re also looking forward to the two a year starting in 2011. All that’s on stride, we’re doing the SSBN replacement initial engineering work right now here and with the UK so EB has got a full plate right now. And, at NASSCO, specific to your question on the commercial side, you know we’re building the T-AKEs, I mentioned that, 13 and 14 as I told you. We’ve got a long lead for both of them. The customer is very supportive of us getting full funding for both of them in this budget and we’ll see what we get. But, either way we’re in the build through 12 right now and we’ll build 13 and 14 in order. The product carriers, we have the five, two delivered I believe and three to go all coming along handsomely. The option for the next four has not been triggered as you know so we’re still marketing that. There could be some impact if we don’t get those four here in the next year, it would affect the loading certainly, the overhead at NASSCO. But, I have every confidence we’re very good out there at matching volume with cost so we know how to manage that if we have to. That said, I would tell you that there’s considerable discussion and I think the QDR will probably be an elemental piece of that in terms of future work for NASSCO as it applies to one, the T-AKE line, a T-AKE or a T-AKE like ship for the Navy’s downstream requirements and then we’ll also see on the product carrier side, it’s interesting, you know about the Jones Act, the Jones Act ships that are out there in large number, I think well over half of them are over 25 to 27 years old. So, that fleet is going to have to be freshed at some point here. We’re talking timing, we’re talking outcomes in the budget and all that I realize but I think the overall shipbuilding picture is a very positive one for us across all three yards.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Safran – Buckingham Research.
Richard Safran – Buckingham Research: Just a question on cash, a two parter, your share count came in just a bit higher than I thought and I just wanted to know if you could go over if there were any headwinds in the quarter? But, more importantly and bigger picture, can you discuss what your intentions are for cash for this year?
Jay L. Johnson : The share count, I think the best way for me to say it is rest assured that the share count is a fundamental part of our scan pattern. I keep using that but I use to be a fighter pilot so it relates to my head. The scan pattern for this company in terms of the way we allocate and deploy our capital. It always has been, always will be. So, we’re mindful of the fact that the share count moves up slightly. But, if you look at us historically on share count absolute and fully diluted we really keep them in really tight bands. The CFO and I look at that all of the time. That said, as it translates to this year, I will tell you that the priority for cash right now and I said it directly in my remarks, we expect a strong cash quarter in Q4 but you also heard me say that we’re going to be challenged to get ourselves to where we like to be in terms of 100% conversion of earnings in to cash. So, quite frankly, until I get myself to the point where I can see that from looking down on it instead of looking up at that 100% line, I’m going to be very much concerned with maintaining operationally liquidity. Liquidity is our strength, it gives us the agility we need to be opportunistic next year, it gives us the ability to access the commercial paper market which is as you know really important to us to get deals done fast, etc. So, in the hierarchy of things we look at here, liquidity is clearly at the top of that list. I mentioned the pension, we made our $250 million contribution in cash to the pension fund this past quarter. We look at the dividend for the board, we look at acquisitions of the non-transformational type right now I would say and we look at share repurchases. You’ll see us dealing with all of that at the right time. But again, to restate the obvious here for me, for us right now, it’s a matter of maintaining liquidity and getting our nose above the 100% water line on earnings to cash conversion.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I actually wanted to follow up that question on the cash flow because it just seems to be as you get closer to 100% net income that would certainly be a little bit better than I was expecting. Can you kind of talk about some of the moving pieces there? Customer advances and deposits grew pretty nicely in Q3 versus the prior quarter and yet the backlog shrunk so I don’t know if you can talk a little bit about that? Your cap ex expectations and are there any major projects on the horizons as to why we might see that grow in to next year?
Jay L. Johnson : Last thing first, I mean the cap ex will hold probably pretty flat for the rest of the year for sure. But, overall I think the biggest movement there to your question really goes right back to aerospace. That’s been the cash issue in large measure for this year with the market down turn so as the market comes back we would expect to see more cash coming out of aerospace and quite frankly we’re looking forward to it. Recall also that we’ve got in this quarter now, fourth quarter, I mentioned we’re going to fly the 650 for the first time and when we do the first 50 or so customers will be asked to provide another payment so that will feed in to the cash plan nicely as well.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: If I can just follow up in a separate sector within combat systems, can you size when you talked about some opportunities for additional Stryker brigade combat teams, can you just size what the potential is there?
Jay L. Johnson : I don’t think so Sam. I mean, it’s premature to do that, we’ve got the seven brigades now, they just announced the 8th. We’ve read in the press like you probably have that there may be more but that’s really the Army’s decision to make and when they do we’ll react accordingly. But clearly, the Stryker piece is a core element of combat going forward. In addition to the number of vehicles remember the other part of that which is the support, the combat logistics support that goes with that and also the reset for the vehicles that have been heavily used in combat, the recapitalization of that existing force and the modernization there too. There’s a lot going on in the Stryker world as there is in Abrams but specific to Stryker, I’ll stay with that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: I wanted to ask you about Gulfstream margins. In your prepared remarks it sounds like you were saying you were actually pretty pleasantly surprised with where the quarter came in but it look like you’re lowering your expectation for the full year. Can you talk about why that is? Is it jet coming along slower or what’s going on there?
Jay L. Johnson : I mean I could have left it where it is and have been close. But, we’re in the same ballpark but we may have a little bit of jet in there but I expect Gulfstream to be ever stronger quarter-by-quarter going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.: Jay, could you add a little more color to the IT business? I know you talked about some of the particular items but it looks as if you’ve been able to grow the business a little faster than the market. Is there something in there that really stands out?
Jay L. Johnson : Howard, I think the way that I would answer that is it is really pretty diverse across the portfolio. We’ve talked about kind of the fast currents in there with the tactical comms and I mentioned some of that in my opening so tactical comms are playing large in there. We’ve got tactical ISR and that was very strong for us this last quarter as I singled out AIS in terms of their margin improvement and the addition of Axsys to that portfolio. We’ve got a lot of IT services opportunity if you will in health IT and fed civ and don’t forget probably the one that crosses all of the IS&T portfolio that is big and ever bigger going forward is cyber. It really is Howard very well diversified across the whole IS&T portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Jay, you talked about gross book-to-bill at 1.5, the net book-to-bill was about .6, could you split that for us between the large biz jets and the midsized and give us some color on the strength in demand by geographies outside of the US?
Jay L. Johnson : The book-to-bill Cai, I’ll put it this way we have great – the order book exceeded the terminations and defaults book again. So it’s moving in the right direction on both ends of that equation. We’re not out of the default business quite obviously yet but we’re coming along. As far as the backlog and how that impacts, what we saw on the termination side if you will, the default termination side is really a mix honestly. It’s some in the large side but it’s weighted more heavily I would say to what you would expect and that’s the softness in the mid cabin market. As to kind of a demographic if you will of the backlog itself, it really is staying pretty consistent here with perhaps if it’s trending at all it’s trending more to the international side. I don’t have a pie chart in front of me but I think it’s got to be able maybe less say 40% US/Canada kind of North America and 60% rest of world with a significant piece of that in the Asia Pacific and in Europe with South America picking up as well so it’s really diverse by geography. As I said before, it remains diverse by owner type if you will in that fully a third are individuals and fully a third of the backlog, actually a little more than a third are private companies. That’s kind of the lay down.
Operator: Your next question comes from Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Jay, one of the steady contributors to expanding segment margins the last few years has been marine and you’re fulfilling the promise of getting to that 10% bogie. What’s the new bogie or are we kind of hitting ourselves on the 10% line? I guess, what are the contributors to that? Is it more the second sub coming in to full production, is it going to swing on repair? If you can just give some color around that and what targets you’re passing along to the organizations.
Jay L. Johnson : It’s volume, it’s sales and it’s performance, it’s continuous improvement so I won’t give you a number because I don’t have a number but around here status quo is never good enough. So, today’s 10% we look to improve. Continuous improvement I’ve told you before it’s in our DNA here so we will never stop trying to improve the margins or the performance in any of our businesses but specific to marine that’s true for sure. You mentioned repair and I mentioned it briefly in my remarks. The repair work is a significant book of business an important book of business within the marine systems group. We’ve talked on earlier occasions about NASSCO and the repair work that’s out there. NASSCO is actually prime on a number of different ship classes that we may or may not have built for repair out in the San Diego area and they’re in work right now on getting more of that work. They’re increasing the fleet size in the San Diego area I think by 30% over the next four to five years and the numbers of ships go from 40 something to 60 something. So, as the fleet kind of realigns itself or the fleets realign themselves so repair work there is very significant as it is at Electric Boat and Bath Iron Works. The repair book is very important to us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joseph Nadol – J. P. Morgan.
Joseph Nadol – J. P. Morgan: I just wanted to follow up again on the cash deployment and specifically the share repurchase. You didn’t buy back any stock this quarter and obviously we’re well down year-on-year from where we were a year ago. I’m wondering I guess just specific thoughts on that and some color on how as a company you’re approaching this in terms of I guess board interaction and I’m thinking of course Nick specifically versus management decisions on share repurchases. What’s the interaction there and how are you thinking about, you’ve made a lot of acquisitions the last 12 to 18 months, how are you thinking about next year?
Jay L. Johnson : Look Joe, as is our practice here, and if you look over your shoulder at us for the last, I don’t care six years maybe, just pick a time, you’ll see that we have a very active year with acquisitions and then we follow it with kind of, my words here, kind of a year of adjusting and settling and that’s kind of the rhythm that we’ve gotten ourselves in to. I’m comfortable with that rhythm right now. I think I mentioned earlier that we’ve got cash at a point that is not where we like to be in that I don’t see a clear sight line to exceeding 100% conversion earnings to cash for the year. Until I do, the number one thing on our list here is going to be operational liquidity. But, make no mistake share repurchase is always a part of our scan pattern as is the dividend, as is the acquisition piece, the opportunistic acquisitions and the pension to which we applied $250 million this quarter. All of those things are looked at all the time here. I would also mention that in terms of the share count and the dilution and all that, it’s really been in very tight bands here if you look at us historically year-over-year. But, right now to give us the agility we need and to allow me to be opportunistic looking forward next year I need to bring the cash level up above 100% and that’s what this is all about.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Stallard – Macquarie Research Equities.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie Research Equities: Jay, a quick question on the combat systems, you mentioned some of the export opportunities you see out there for CS. If any of these get pushed to the right would it be fair to suggest that growth in combat systems next year could slow versus what you are seeing this year?
Jay L. Johnson : I don’t see it right now Rob honestly. Frankly, if some of the internationals move to the right, my view is they’re going to move in to 2010 not out of 2010. But anyway, I think for now I’m pretty comfortable with the flow if you will of the international programs. Remember, the Canadian program is on a fast track by their choice. We’ve got a big year in the United Kingdom with the FRES contract that they’re trying to get nailed down here in the next few months and we’ve got Saudi Arabia, Iraq, we’ve got all of our FMS and indigenous international work targeted really, as I think I mentioned in my remarks, kind of more to a 2011/2012 timeline but 2010 should be teeing us up nicely. I don’t see it as a downer for growth if you will in combat systems. I’ll stand by what I said earlier, that portfolio is a slow, slow, steady powerful growth business for General Dynamics.
Operator: Your next question comes from Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: I’m wondering if you can just give us an update on LCS, I think you finished builder sea trials, kind of how did that go and what’s some of the feedback you’re getting from the customer?
Jay L. Johnson : We did complete builder sea trials, builders’ trials last week. My somewhat subjective answer to your question would be is it performed beautifully. It’s fast, it’s sleek, it’s seaworthy, it’s got great capability and we are very impressed with my own ship if you don’t mind me saying that. So, okay, I think the customer was satisfied at that point. Obviously they were because we’re now moving in to acceptance trials in serv by another name. The acceptance trials which start, don’t hold me to this, but it’s mid November plus or minus a little so that’s all on track and then once that completes we’ll turn it over to the customer and be on our way with the next one that’s already in the build down there. Overall, it’s a wonderful platform of great capability and we look forward to providing lots of them to our customer.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Strauss – UBS.
David Strauss – UBS: Jay or Hugh, could you just touch on pension going forward. Obviously the $250 million contribution this quarter but I think at the end of last year you were close to $3 billion under funded. Just what you’re looking at from a contribution standpoint given PPA and CAS harmonization?
Jay L. Johnson : Right now David what we’re looking at, we gave the $250 this year, we’re looking at I think just a little north of that next year, $260ish. Then, after that it gets up around the $500 something for probably four or five years. That’s present conditions and that’s not really understanding the final lay down on CAS/PPA harmonization but that’s kind of the sight picture we have today. I think it’s important to say though that given what I just described we do not believe that that will impede our ability to affectively allocate and deploy our capital to do the things we need to do to grow this company going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ronald Epstein – Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald Epstein – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a broader 200,000 foot question for you, in your prepared remarks you mentioned about Secretary Gates talking about having kind of steady low single digit budget growth going forward for the defense budget. Given the fiscal backdrop and all the pressures, roughly 13% of GDP deficit this year, potentially deficits as you go out five or six years that are still north of 5%, is that realistic?
Jay L. Johnson : Well, I think the way that I’d answer that Ron is I just look in the world in which we’re living right now. It gets back to the question of how much risk are we willing to tolerate inside that world. The risk management piece I think is different than it ever has been before. But, for us again, as the defense budget flattens which essentially is what is happening here, we still believe what I said in my remarks. If you have programs and systems and things that are relevant to the war fighter your programs and systems and things will prevail in large measure. So, we felt very good going in to all of this, we feel confident that we’ll be well supported coming out.
Amy Gilliland : I think that wraps up the time we have this morning. I’d like to thank everyone for joining the call and if you do have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3748. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2009 General Dynamics earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Amy Gilliland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, [Nikita], and good morning, everyone. Welcome to General Dynamics second quarter conference call. I want to remind listeners that any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimate regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson: Thank you, Amy, and good morning.  General Dynamics delivered a strong second quarter performance. Our sales totaled $8.1 billion, up nearly 11% from the prior year period. Operating earnings were $945 million, the highest result in company history. This led to earnings per share of $1.61 on a fully diluted basis, $0.01 ahead of last year's second quarter result. The year-over-year EPS comparison is imperfect as a result of tax, interest and share count variances, and we'll talk more about those a little later. This quarter, however, was the stronger on an operating earnings basis. Year-to-date sales are up 14% and operating earnings are up around 4% when compared to the first six months of 2008. This year-to-date performance is particularly attractive on top of the very strong growth we experienced in the first six months of 2008 compared to 2007. You may recall 2008's six-month sales were up 11% and operating earnings were up 24%.  The key driver behind this quarter's results was the continuing ability of our businesses to deliver operationally. Their disciplined execution is evidenced in the better than anticipated operating margin in each of the businesses in the quarter, particularly at Marine Systems. Companywide margins improved 70 basis points from the first to the second quarter and our ROIC increased to nearly 19%, 100 basis point improvement over second quarter 2008. Let me turn to cash. Second quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $520 million, which represents 84% of earnings from continuing operations. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $593 million. As in years past, I expect strong cash generation in the second half, particularly in the defense businesses. Orders this quarter were close to $6 billion, with particularly strong activity in the Information Systems and Technology group. At the end of the quarter total backlog was nearly $68 billion, down approximately 5% from the first quarter but up 22% over the second quarter of last year. Now I'd like to spend some time on the outlook for each of our businesses, beginning with defense.  Our defense businesses have all experienced strong support in the ongoing 2010 budget deliberations. While there is still more work remaining until the 2010 defense bill becomes law, I am confident that GD's programs will come through the process with solid support by the Congress.  As you all know, the Department of Defense is in the middle of its Quadrennial Defense Review. When complete, this document should shape the outlook for the future year's defense plan. Until the QDR decisions are completed and communicated to the public, there's really not much that can be definitely said about the long-term defense spending trends; however, Secretary Gates has been very clear about his intention to have a budget with, and I quote, "a steady, sustainable and predictable rate of growth." The Secretary has also stressed the importance of providing our military with weapons systems that have the flexibility to confront both conventional and asymmetric threats.  Current threat levels, my previous experience with these types of internal deliberations, and the relevancy of GD's programs to the warfighter lead me to believe that our company will emerge from this review well supported. Understandably, there'll be both puts and takes in the QDR results, but I believe that our combat vehicles will continue to comprise a significant portion of the Army's order of battle, our surface combatants and submarines will be pivotal in addressing conventional and strategic threats as well as tactical intelligence requirements, and our IS&T portfolio will continue to be integral to meeting the Pentagon's tactical communications, ISR and cyber warfare needs.  Let's talk about Combat Systems. Combat Systems experienced healthy year-over-year growth in both sales and earnings this quarter. Sales were over $2.4 billion, a 19% increase over the same period last year. Of that growth, 14% was organic. While our organic growth was principally driven by increased Stryker and Abrams volume, each of our three domestic businesses increased their sales year-over-year. The remaining growth came from the addition of AxleTech to the group's weapons systems business.  The group's earnings totaled $300 million, a 6% year-over-year increase. This is a particularly good result on top of the 18% sales growth and 48% earnings growth the group had in the second quarter of 2008 versus the same period in 2007.  Margins were down 150 basis points year-over-year primarily because of the higher-margin second quarter 2008 MRAP work that drove the group's margins to an uncharacteristic 14%. Sequentially, the group increased earnings on similar sales volume, resulting in a 90 basis point margin increase. These improved margins are the result of productivity improvements across all of our North American Combat Systems operations.  European Land Systems revenues were down slightly this quarter compared with last year. Year-to-date, revenues and earnings have been steady. ELS continues to improve their operations and I expect their results to be better in the third quarter and even stronger in the fourth quarter, a patter consistent with their past performance.  Total backlog for Combat Systems decreased by approximately $1.6 billion in the quarter. Nearly 60% of this decline is the result of de-booking the mostly unfunded backlog for future combat systems, in line with the Pentagon's cancellation of the manned ground vehicle portion of FCS. As you know, the Secretary of Defense and the Army remain committed to developing a replacement ground combat vehicle program. Our Army customer is currently reevaluating the structure of brigade combat teams. Because the revolutionary next-generation vehicle program is delayed, the Army is now modernizing and evolving current vehicles. Frankly, we see the cancellation of FCS as an opportunity. We are well positioned to evolve our combat vehicles, including Stryker and Abrams, to address the changing threats faced by our soldiers. Combat Systems received several notable orders in the quarter, including approximately $320 million for the production of Strykers and approximately $450 million for the production of wheeled armored vehicles for a Middle Eastern customer. Additionally, subsequent to the quarter end the group was selected by the Canadian Department of National Defense for a sole-source contract with potential value of over $850 million to upgrade Canada's light armored vehicle fleet. Looking forward for the group, sales in the remainder of the year will be higher than both year-to-date and last year's second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. Overall sales in 2009 will be up about 22% over 2008. Earnings will also be stronger in the second half. Margins for the year will be 12.3% to 12.5%, comparable with our original expectations. Marine Systems group had another very strong quarter. Sales were up nearly 17% for the quarter at approximately $1.6 billion. Earnings were up over 32% at $168 million. This growth in sales and earnings was across all three shipyards, but was particularly driven by increased Virginia class volume and engineering work at Electric Boat and increased commercial ship and repair volume at NASSCO.  Earnings growth outpaced sales growth across all three Marine businesses, causing operating margins to expand 120 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points sequentially. Marine's margin improvement comes from strong operational performance and in turn increased booking rates on all of the group's major programs.  The Marine group's backlog totaled approximately $24 billion at the end of the quarter, down slightly from the first quarter but up over 100% from the same quarter last year. There are a number of notable opportunities on the horizon, which may add further to the group's backlog once the 2010 budget is approved, including two additional DDG-1000s and one additional DDG-51 mentioned by Secretary Gates as part of his budget preview remarks in April; development work on the next generation ballistic missile submarine program, which was well supported in the President's 2010 budget request; additional Littoral Combat Ships - quarter end backlog includes the group's second ship; the group is also currently bidding on the next two ships in the class.  Looking forward, sales for the remainder of the year will improve over the same period last year but will not be quite as strong as the first half of 2009. Overall, sales should be up a little over 16% compared with last year, well ahead of our earlier guidance. Margins for the year are anticipated to be 9.8% to 9.9%, an improvement of 40 to 50 basis points over last year.  In our IS&T group sales were approximately $2.7 billion, up 3.5% over second quarter 2008 and 9.6% year-to-date. Organic growth for the first six months of 2009 totaled nearly 7%. The group's second quarter operating earnings were $284 million, down slightly year-over-year. year-to-date earnings were up 4% compared to first half 2008, primarily volume related. Operating margins were 70 basis points less year-over-year but exceeded by expectations. To that point, second quarter margins were 10 basis points better than those in the first quarter on slightly lower volume. This still appears to us to be industry leading performance. Backlog for the group increased to $10.5 billion because of strong order activity across the IS&T businesses, including $180 million in orders under the common hardware/software program and $375 million to upgrade the Bowman Tactical Communications system in the United Kingdom. Book to bill totaled 1 time for the quarter, the seventh of the past eight quarters in which the group has met or exceeded 1:1.  Looking ahead in 2009, IS&T is in an excellent position to leverage its current and expanding capabilities to capture new business in fast-growing market segments. In particular, the group's ISR business had heavier volume in its signals collection and cyber products in the second quarter and I expect that trend to continue. In fact, subsequent to the quarter this business was selected as a participant in two significant IDIQ awards in this arena - a $600 million five-year contract to perform signals intelligence for the Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center and a $400 million contract to secure critical federal and private sector networks.  The ISR business will also benefit from the addition of Axsys, an acquisition we announced in the quarter. Axsys is a leading provider of surveillance and imaging technologies, including state of the art lens and gimble technologies. From a strategic standpoint we plan to leverage Axsys products into our sensing and algorithm exploitation capabilities to enhance our product offerings and expand our footprint in this fast-growing market space. I expect that the deal will close later in the third quarter, be neutral to earnings for the last quarter and accretive in 2010. For the rest of the year IS&T volume will be stronger than the first half and stronger than the same period a year ago. Overall, I anticipate a little above 8% sales growth. Margins will likely decline in the second half as a result of mix shift toward lower-margin services business, but I expect full year margins to be consistent with our previous guidance - in a range of 10.3% to 10.4%. Aerospace. The Aerospace group executed extremely well again this quarter amid a difficult, albeit gradually improving, business jet market. The group's sales were $1.4 billion, up 6.5% from the prior year quarter due to the addition of jet aviation.  Organically, Gulfstream sales were down 16% year-over-year as unit deliveries were reduced in line with our revised production plan. Sales were also impacted by continued pressure on the services business, which is off 21% year-over-year and 15% year-to-date. This decline is the result of customers deferring optional maintenance and intensified price competition triggered by current market conditions. Though I wouldn't characterize this as a trend, we are seeing some increased service activity this month.  The group's operating earnings were down 10% year-over-year to $215 million; however, compared with last quarter earnings were up 7.5% on somewhat lower volume, a very good result that is clearly indicative of how well the group is managing through this down cycle.  The group continues to target cost reductions, including eliminating almost $45 million of indirect costs in the first half of 2009. You may recall from an earlier report that we anticipated $60 million in savings for the year; we expect to achieve that and more.  This strong earnings result led to 150 basis points of margin improvement over the first quarter. A favorable mix of large aircraft deliveries and continuous improvement initiatives combined to push Gulfstream margins to 17.9%. These margins include a $2 million loss on two pre-owned aircraft sold in the quarter, $13 million in severance costs, and $10 million in warranty reserves, offset in part by $15 million in liquidated damages. We have six remaining pre-owned aircraft in inventory, including one under contract, and we anticipate receiving no more than three additional aircraft before year end. We have no white tails.  Jet aviation also showed some operational improvement in the quarter, although they still have a significant way to go. The Aerospace group is leveraging its completions experience and seasoned leadership team to make some meaningful changes to Jet's completion's business. These management and process changes are already making a difference in Jet's performance. I expect that this business will continue to make incremental improvements in the second half. There continue to be several encouraging signs that the business jet market is stabilizing. In recent months Gulfstream flying hours have increased and new order interest has improved. On an absolute basis dollar-denominated book to bill this quarter was a healthy 1 time. This does not include the impact of defaults. Another positive sign was that customer defaults were down almost 50% from last quarter and orders handily outpaced defaults in the quarter. In fact, excluding G-650 orders, this is the most orders we have taken since the second quarter of last year. Despite this, we did see a marginal drop in the group's backlog, but at nearly $20 billion, they continue to have a very robust base of work.  In March the company provided 2009 and notional 2010 aircraft production guidance. I feel very comfortable with our 2009 large cabin production estimates. Our large cabin spots are sold out through the end of this year. For 2010 I anticipate the large cabin production number to be in the low 70s. Midsize production may further decline, however, as that end of the market continues to struggle with large inventories and considerable pricing pressure. We are closely monitoring this situation and will make further midsize cuts as necessary, although I don't anticipate they'll impact my expectations for the group's performance. On the product development front, Gulfstream continues to progress on schedule. We look forward to both the G-250 and G-650 making their first flights this year.  As you heard on our last call, we expect the group to have fewer aircraft deliveries in the third quarter because of the previously announced summer furlough at Gulfstream's Savannah manufacturing facility. Consequently, the group's third quarter sales will likely be off a little over 20% and operating margins will be down accordingly. For the full year I expect the group's sales to be down about 5%. Operating margins I anticipate to be between 13.3% and 13.5%.  In summary, General Dynamics has performed very well in the first half of 2009, positioning the company to do well in the second half. The third quarter will be somewhat softer as a result of the Gulfstream furlough; however, the second half should be very strong for our defense businesses. For the year we anticipate sales growth of 11% and operating earnings margins slightly in excess of 11%. I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.05 to $6.15, an increase from our prior guidance. From today's perspective I would guide you toward the midpoint of that range, with some potential upside and some risk in each of our groups.  With that, I'll ask Hugh Redd to touch on several key financial highlights. Hugh?
Hugh Redd: Thank you, Jay. There are a few items I'd like to point out that impact the comparison our 2009 to our 2008 earnings per share.  The first is interest expense, which was up $26 million in the quarter and $46 million for the first half of the year. This is driven by an increase in our net debt as we completed five acquisitions and repurchased almost 14 million shares since the end of the second quarter of 2008. To be clear, no transactions were completed nor shares repurchased in this quarter but rather in the three preceding quarters.  As you may recall, in December of 2008 we issued $1 billion of five-year notes at a coupon of 5.25% and more recently in June we issued $750 million of two-year paper at a 1.8% coupon. At the end of the quarter our net debt is down almost $400 million compared to the end of the first quarter and is at a level consistent with the end of 2008. Taking into consideration our net debt position and the interest rates on our new debt, we continue to expect full year interest expense of approximately $150 million.  Next I'd like to draw your attention to our effective tax rate. In the second quarter of 2008 we resolved tax litigation dating back to the early 1990s. This resulted in a one-time benefit of $35 million, which reduced the 2008 second quarter tax rate by 385 basis points and it also increased earnings per share by $0.09. We received the cash associated with that settlement in the fourth quarter of last year. Our tax rate for 2009 in both the second quarter and for the first six months of 2009 was approximately 31.5%, consistent with our full year expectation.  Finally, return on invested capital improved 18.8%, a 100 basis point improvement over second quarter 2008, and return on equity improved to 22.3%, a 190 basis points improvement.  That concludes my remarks and, Amy, I'll turn it back to you for the question-and-answer session.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Hugh. Before we move to the question-and-answer period I'd like to remind participants to ask only one question so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. If you have an additional question, please get back into the queue. [Nikita], could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: A question for you on the QDR as it portends to potential changes that could come out of that. One of the decisions that's certainly getting floated is to move away from a two-peer adversary or two conventional conflicts simultaneously and the implications that that will have on force structure and resources. I know you quoted Gates' comment about a stable, potential growing defense budget, but how do you think that that decision in particular could impact GD relative to what it's selling into the defense markets? How do you think it'll impact and over what time?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, Myles, I wouldn't try to pre-guess the QDR outcome, as you might expect, but I would tell you that from our perspective my sense is if you look at our defense portfolio, we've got a lot of diversification in there. And to the point I made in my remarks about needing to deal with conventional threats and asymmetric or unconventional threats, we cover that space. So the two major war scenario is something they'll have to work their way through, but in any outcome that I can imagine with the QDR the diversity of our portfolio I think puts us in a very strong position.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Jay, you gave us a lot of very good color on what you're seeing in the business jet markets and things sort of stabilizing. I guess you guys had previous alluded to the potential for large cabin rates to actually go higher in 2010 versus 2009. Is that something that's still on the table and that you're thinking about, and can you just kind of update us on that?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I like your thinking, Noah, but at this point I think the prudent statement is the one I made. We feel quite comfortable looking at 2010 in the 70s, the low 70s, for large cabin. As you know, also, we have the capacity and the wherewithal to ramp that up if we need to or ramp it down, but we don't see that as an outcome here. So we'll see how the market develops.  We're encouraged by what we're seeing. I mentioned it in my remarks. But the large cabin market is drawing great interest and the order book is very healthy and getting more so, so we're confident that we can ramp it up if we need to.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Jay, could you give us some more color on Gulfstream in terms of the mix of order and demand between the U.S. and foreign buyers?
Jay L. Johnson: Actually, Cai, I would characterize it as quite balanced by both geography and the types of buyers within that - the demographic within that geography. It's a mix almost across all segments, I would say. Probably a little more international than North America right now, but pretty close to a balance, and I would categorize it as a higher percentage of private company individuals as opposed to public companies. But it's a pretty good mix across the spectrum. We're not singled up on any one sector that causes us an issue.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: Could you, Jay, talk to us a little bit about foreign military sales - there are substantial offers outstanding - and where are you in terms of closing on some of them, please?
Jay L. Johnson: Okay, Howard, I'd be happy to. The foreign military sales - we'll have a Combat discussion here. We feel that we have great opportunity in the FMS arena. As you alluded, some of it's ongoing right now. We see opportunity in Saudi Arabia. Those contracts, the same contracts for brigades four and five, are in work right now, so that's still coming; we anticipate it'll be here this year. We've got FMS business working in Iraq already; we expect more. That's a work in progress, as you might have known. So we think there's great opportunity there.  I mentioned the Canadian piece, but there's great opportunity for Combat in Canada with the LAV-3 upgrade, as mentioned, but also in follow to that, the Canadian National Defense Department is putting forth requirements for three different tactical vehicles or armored vehicles that we think will be something we will participate in as well.  So there's lots of opportunity out there.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: But the Iraqis are sort of short on cash and some of this looks like it's being pushed back a little bit. Could you just talk about how you're addressing those challenges?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, as you know, Mr. Maliki was here last week and so those discussions are ongoing right now. And we work all of that through FMS, so we're not dealing directly with the Iraqis, as you'd expect.  But we still remain confident that that is going to get worked out. Don't ask me exactly what that means, but we will come to a decision point here in the not-too-distant future and we believe we're going to get a considerable amount of business through FMS in Iraq.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Ron Epstein - BAS-ML.
Ron Epstein - BAS-ML: You mentioned that orders for Gulfstream in the quarter were greater than [break in audio].
Amy Gilliland: Operator?
Operator:  Yes.
Amy Gilliland: I think we dropped Ron Epstein, so perhaps he can try to get back in the queue and you can get someone else on the line?
Operator:  Your next question comes from Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: A bigger picture question for you. There's at least some modest speculation that one or more of your competitors may need to sell or spin some businesses as a result of changing language around OCI. I wondered if you'd speak to your views about what this might mean for your portfolio of business? Can they be appropriately secluded? Is it a material amount of business? And if some of these things were to happen among some of your peers would there be an opportunity to buy or would you be precluded from ownership of some of these assets? Just in very general terms, how is GD thinking about these issues?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, Carter, I know there's a lot of discussion and a lot of print about the OCI issue right now, but for us it really comprises - the SETA-type work is really a very small part of our IS&T portfolio. And, frankly, we deal with it customer by customer and probably the best example of that is when Antheon came aboard and the SETA work at Antheon was divested. So I know it's out there a lot, but for us it's not a big deal.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Do you think it's something, I mean, if you were to look broadly at the rest of the industry, is it something that can appropriately be fenced off or is this the direction that we're headed? Are these assets going to come out? Do you have a view?
Jay L. Johnson: For us it's not, as I alluded already, it's not a part of the business that we particularly yearn for. We're more of a product and a services house in that regard, a product house. So I would say it's not something that's high on our go-to list. 
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: So if something were to come out of your peers, it's not a business you'd be particularly interested in?
Jay L. Johnson: Not necessarily, no. No is probably my best answer.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Ron Epstein - BAS-ML.
Ron Epstein - BAS-ML: Jay, you mentioned that defaults in the quarter were less - orders were greater than defaults for Gulfstream. Did you see any trend in the defaults and can you give us any more color around that because some of the other jet OEMs have had huge numbers of defaults in the quarter and you guys have done a lot better, so I'm just trying to get a feel for maybe why. 
Jay L. Johnson: Well, the defaults, I would characterize it, Ron, as fairly balanced across the whole Gulfstream portfolio, but the order book was, as I alluded to earlier, heavily weighted to the large cabin, so that's good for us.
Ron Epstein - BAS-ML: Can you put a number on defaults or no?
Jay L. Johnson: I could but I won't. Sorry. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from David Strauss - UBS Securities.
David Strauss - UBS Securities: Could you touch on the outlook for Combat Systems beyond 2009, specifically from the domestic side of things, based on what you see in the fiscal 2010 budget? It looks at is Abrams and Stryker funding in '10 is down significantly.
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I alluded to it earlier, but let me just say, David, that going into the 2010 budget deliberations we felt cautious optimistic, shall we say, on those two programs in particular. And I think coming out that will be validated and more. You're asking me my sense of it; that's exactly what it is. Both of those, the Stryker and the Abrams, are relevant to the warfighter and I keep coming back to that, the relevance to the warfighter at a time when we are at war. I believe that our customer is going to demand more and we're prepared to give it to them.
David Strauss - UBS Securities: Jay, are you thinking specifically Congress is either going to plus up these programs in particular or are you expecting a second fiscal '10 supplemental?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, if you look at some of the marks, the HAC-D mark, for example, there is plus up in there. So we're encouraged by the dialogue that's going with that, so I would hope that we'll come out of the budget itself with it.  You've also read some people are already talking about a supplemental for next year. I'm not prepared to comment on that except to say that it's out there and we're going to do whatever it takes to service the warfighters out there. That's my belief.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Robert Stallard - Macquarie Research Equities.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Research Equities: Just a follow on from David's question, I was wondering if you've seen any impact flowing through your business from the finalized FY '09 supplemental, which was down year-on-year?
Jay L. Johnson: I missed the last part of that, Robert.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Research Equities: I'm saying if you've seen any impact of the FY '09 supplemental on your business, either positive or negative, but it's down year-on-year.
Jay L. Johnson: Yes, we got some lift out of it, but I don't think I have much more to comment on it than that. It was positive for us, the supplemental. We got some Stryker add in there, so it was fine. I'm not sure what more you're looking for.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Research Equities: I was wondering if you could give us any additional granularity because there's some pretty big captions in the supplemental - and we have seen some of the line items trend down year-on-year - and just looking to see whether any of that has impacted on your equipment or services businesses?
Jay L. Johnson: No, the supplemental is embedded in the numbers I gave you so I think we're well heeled for the year in that regard.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: In your opening remarks you didn't really talk at all about the cash flow and I just wanted to make sure, what are your views on free cash this year? Is it still going to approximate net income? And then can you just talk a little bit about the moving pieces that we'll see in the second half because certainly customer advances and deposits, with what went on with Gulfstream, was a pretty big negative in the first half. Does that start to reverse as we move forward in the year?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, I think you've hit upon the essential ingredient here to second half cash flow and that has a lot to do with Aerospace/Gulfstream.  But I would say to your first comment that our objective is always to get to 100% with our cash, but I would also be less than candid if I didn't say that it's going to be a tough, tough go this year, as you might expect. But the defense businesses are strong in the second half; we like the trending that we're seeing in the Aerospace side, so we remain very aggressive and very optimistic there.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan : My question is on the two Gulfstream development programs. You gave a bit of color in your comments but just wondering if you could give maybe a little bit more, maybe on timing of first flights for each of them? How are the development programs going, more specifically, is there anything that's more challenging than expected and how are you working through it? And what's the demand picture been looking like in recent quarters since all this turmoil has started - cancellation activity, new orders, etc.
Jay L. Johnson: We are taking orders for the 250. The 650 book is solid. There have been a couple puts and takes on the far end of that, but both aircraft we expect to be very eagerly received, so that part of it looks good to us. As far as the jets themselves, they look like jets; they look like real airplanes now. They're coming together nicely. They're working hard at it. As you might expect, there are some challenges inside the lifelines there, but we still are very much confident that we'll fly these airplanes later this year. If you ask me to pin that down, I'd say probably early in the fourth quarter, but that could move around a little and that's okay.  You know the process. You basically take a static article, you build a static jet, and then you run that static article through very grueling tests on the ground, and before you can take the flight article, if you will, and put it in the air, the static article has to pass. So process-wise that's happening down in Savannah right now with the 650. It's happening in Israel with the 250. And those things are coming along apace and we're very confident that we'll fly both of those airplanes this year and I'm really looking forward to it. 
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan:  Can we extrapolate from that that the certification programs are also on schedule for both aircraft?
Jay L. Johnson: If I had Joe Lombardo here he'd give you a more precise answer, but my answer to that is yes. But we're in the process now. We're just starting to test the test articles, the static articles, if you will, so it'll be awhile. But I don't see any showstoppers in front of us, if that's what you're asking me. These are going to be wonderful machines and we're going to get them airborne here in the not too distant future.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Peter Arment - Broadpoint AmTech.
Peter Arment - Broadpoint AmTech: Just quickly on cyber, it continues to be talked quite a bit about and since last quarter I think there's been some further movement in terms of funding. How does GD look at this? As a significant booking opportunity in the second half or is it more of a 2010 event?
Jay L. Johnson: No, I mean, here we're already into cyber to the tune of probably $1 billion a year and for us, as you probably know, it's spread across all of the lines of business in IS&T. So we've got the forensics, we've got the encryption, we've got the information management and security, we've got the infrastructure piece across our lines of business, so we're well into cyber and we'll continue to be there. We see that as a very handsome long-term growth opportunity within IS&T.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [George Alar] - Stifel Nicolaus.
George Alar - Stifel Nicolaus: Could you guys talk a little bit about the mix that you mentioned and kind of bringing down margins at IS&T? Should we generally view this as kind of a low 10% margin business or do you plan on quickly returning back up to kind of the mid to high 10% margins beyond some of the near-term mix shift issues?
Jay L. Johnson: Well, we've said for the year we're going to be low 10s and we're confident in that, so going forward I think you could expect that, maybe a little more. Is that what you're asking me?
George Alar - Stifel Nicolaus: You guys did about 10.6% - 10.7% in the first half and then you dropped down to about 10% margins, so I'm just wondering kind of long-term is this about a 10% margin business or kind of in between there and what are the near-term issues, also?
Jay L. Johnson: The service mix is what you're really seeing here, I think, and as the mix changes more to IT services, which is a lower-margin business but a wonderfully steady and long-term business, we think where we are is in the low to mid 10 range, and that's probably as precise as I want to get it right now.
Operator:  Your next question comes from George Shapiro - Access 342.
George Shapiro - Access 342: In Combat Systems you're expecting to sustain - actually even accelerate a bit - the growth in the second half versus the first half, yet you've got a big decrease in MRAP revenues in the second half versus the second half of last year. What programs are actually ramping up substantially in the second half to offset that?
Jay L. Johnson: Probably the biggest is - and this is as it goes through most of the years - the European, as you know, is a first to fourth quarter building business, so I would expect a lot of the second half to be reflective of the growth that we would normally and always see in Europe, European Land Systems.
George Shapiro - Access 342: But you're probably losing maybe $500 or $600 million of revenues for the MRAP in the second half versus last year so I just wonder if you could maybe be a little more specific as to what programs European Land Systems might be increasing that much to offset the MRAP?
Jay L. Johnson: Program specific, it's really all the programs over there. That’s the way the European model is working, such that it comes to you late in the year - sometimes real late in the year, but it comes. We've also got - ATP has got a significant amount of work. And so, I mean, Europe is the big mover in the second half, I guess, is probably the cleanest way to say it, George.
Operator:  Your next question comes from James McIlree - Collins Stewart LLC.
James McIlree - Collins Stewart LLC: In the second half it looks like you have Marine revenues up substantially over the first half revenues, but margins not expanding at all. What's the reason for that?
Jay L. Johnson: We're pulling pretty handsome margins out of Marine across the year. I mean, 10.3% this quarter was superb and we're targeting ourselves to the high 9s across the year. I'm pretty confident and comfortable and pleased with that.
James McIlree - Collins Stewart LLC: Is there any change in mix in the second half that we should be aware of?
Jay L. Johnson: None that I could think of except one of the realities in the second half of the year has to do with repair work. I mentioned in my remarks about repair work at NASSCO specifically. Sometimes that comes to you in fits and starts as the customer goes through the end of their year, so there may be opportunity there that we haven't expected. It could work the other way as well, but I'm very confident in the high 9s for Marine, and we're very proud of that.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: A lot of discussion on Combat here and there's obviously a lot of moving pieces, but you guys are on record as throwing out a couple of different mid single digit growth numbers in 2010. I just wonder if you're sticking by that given everything you see here or any comment there?
Jay L. Johnson: I would characterize it this way: Combat is a solid, steady growth business that - I actually characterize it in the terms of an Abrams - it's the Abrams tank, okay? It's very sturdy, it's very steady, and it proceeds as it needs to. And Combat will grow its portfolio in smart moves, but you're going to see slow, steady growth out of Combat.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: So it sounds like thinking something in the low to mid single digits for 2010 is still reasonable?
Jay L. Johnson: Yes. Yes. 
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: And, Jay, one more question for you. Given that you're kind of the new kid on the block here I wondered if you'd just take a minute from a very high level to talk strategy, maybe the two or three things that you're focused on the most in the near term for the company, things you might do a little different, any comments there.
Jay L. Johnson: Okay, strategy. It's interesting. Nick and I worked together for a long time on this transition. The objective was that when he walked out the door, as he did on the first of the month, it would be as seamless as it could possibly be. I believe that has happened, okay? I feel that way. I have great confidence and pride in this magnificent corporation and I'm proud to be its President and CEO. The portfolio is diverse and very strong. We own on the commercial side, we manufacture the premier brand on this earth in Gulfstream, okay? On the defense side, our portfolio, as I've said before, is diverse, it's very strong, and it is relevant in today's world and the world we see out ahead. So that portfolio is pretty wholesome the way it is.  Static and status quo are never good things in this business, so we will continue to enrich and nourish that portfolio as opportunities present themselves. How do we do that? We do that the way Nick taught us and that's about earnings and cash and ROIC and margins. Those disciplines are in our DNA, as I've said before. That's the enabler. Those are the enablers to allow you to nourish and enrich this portfolio. So that's where my focus of effort is. That's where my commitment is to both our customers and our wonderful men and women in uniform out there that we're serving and to our shareholders. 
Amy Gilliland: [Nikita], I think we have time for one more question.
Operator:  Your final question comes from Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: When you look forward at Marine - and I know you all have talked about expanding margins over time - there are two things ahead of you here, one is more work on the DDG-1000 and another one is the next DDG-51, which you had referred to earlier. When you look at those two ships, is this going to create a challenge in terms of expanding margins on the DDG-1000 or on the DDG-51 given that you'll have a gap here between current production and the start of that new ship?
Jay L. Johnson: New ship meaning?
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: The next DDG-51 that you would start later.
Jay L. Johnson: I don't see that as an issue honestly, Doug, because we're well versed in the construction of DDG-51s, as you know. And the DDG-1000, I mean, you've probably had this conversation with Nick and/or me before, but that DDG-1000, going into that new build, the design work is more complete than with any other ship class start we've ever seen. So we have strong confidence in our ability to bring the DDG-1000s home the way we signed the contract to bring them home. So we have good confidence in the ability of our workers up at Bath Iron Works as well as the leadership up there to do exactly what we said we were going to do and deliver a quality product on time and on budget.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: You don't see the DDG-51, going to the next one, as being, I'd say first, significantly different in terms of the capability or cost of that ship? 
Jay L. Johnson: My answer today, Doug, is no, I do not see that. I mean, if the customer changes something and wants to take it to a different place, that's a discussion that I'm certainly not privy to yet and we would adapt accordingly. But right now we do DDG-51s beautifully and we can continue to do that.
Operator:  This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Amy Gilliland for closing remarks.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you for joining the call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3748. Have a great day. Thanks.
Operator:  This concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the first quarter 2009 General Dynamics earnings conference call. My name is Dan and I’ll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today’s call, Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations; please proceed.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you Dan and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter conference call. I want to remind listeners that as always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimate regarding the company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Chabraja.
Nick Chabraja: Thank you, Amy. Good morning. I’m obviously pleased with the first quarter performance at General Dynamics. We’re off to a strong start in what promises to be another good year.  With respect to revenue sales we’re up 18%. We had double digit top line growth in each of our four operating segments, when compared with the first quarter of 2008. I might point out Combat’s and Marine Systems, the volume was particularly strong as they both topped 20% sales growth in the quarter.  Earnings per share from continuing operations grew 8.5% to $1.54 on a fully diluted basis. This earnings growth is to me particularly impressive, because it comes on top of a 33% growth in fully diluted EPS in the first quarter of 2008 of the comparative period. So we experienced good growth on top of really marvelous growth.  Backlog; the company’s backlog at the end of the quarter totaled $71 billion, 43% higher than where the backlog stood at the end of the first quarter 2008. In the quarter, we had healthy order activity in the IS&T and Combat Systems groups and that helped offset slower Aerospace orders. When combined with $17.9 billion of potential contract value, the total estimated contract value at the end of the quarter was an impressive $89 billion.  Cash, we’re a little weak. The company generated $73 million of cash after capital expenditures in the quarter. I would point out that cash is generally weaker in the first quarter, and particularly strong in the second half of the year. I expect that pattern to repeat itself again in 2009. To give you a little color, the defense businesses cash production was very strong in the quarter, but the aerospace businesses, both of them were significant users of cash in the quarter.  Let me speak to the performance of each of the four segments briefly, and then we’ll get to your questions and some additional remarks that Hugh has planned for you. Combat Systems; this was another strong quarter for Combat Systems, with revenue increasing 20.5% year-over-year. Nearly 50% of the sales growth in the quarter came from increased Abrams and Stryker volume; right in the core. The organic growth in the group was 13.7%. With the rest coming from AxleTech and acquisition we completed in the fourth quarter last year.  The first quarter revenue growth is consistent with our revenue guidance of 20% to 25% for this segment. Operating earnings also grew nicely in the quarter, albeit at a rate slower than sales. Consequently, the group’s margins declined 140 basis points to 11.6%. This compression was caused by a mix shift in the group’s workload for the quarter, primarily attributable to MRAP volume at lower margins than those achieved during the first quarter of 2008. 2008 you might recall we had the highly successful Cougar program.  I think I would also add that maybe Europe didn’t do as well as we had expected this year, as a result of a couple of operating issues in the quarter, but I think they’ll be back on track as we go through the year, and they tend to build during the year because they’re on the units of delivery accounting methodology, which somehow seems to result in fairly irregular performance, but heavily balanced towards the end of the year.  For the entire group, I expect margins to rise quarter-by-quarter throughout the year. Consequently, full year group margins, consistent with our previous guidance of approximately 12.5%, appear achievable.  Combat Systems backlog stood at $14.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to add $1.5 billion, principally arising out of Saudi Arabia and light armored vehicles and tanks before year end. There are numerous other opportunities, including additional foreign military sales to Iraq on the horizon, which present upside to our current outlook.  Maybe let me conclude my remarks with respect to this segment by talking a little bit about MRAP. MRAP has been for us a great adjacent market opportunity. The company has been able to earn a healthy return on very little capital investment, in a market in which we never previously participated. Together with our partner, force protection, we were selected to compete for work in the follow-on MRAP ATV or MRAP light competition. This provides us some continuing opportunity to participate in this tactical real vehicle market.  Moving over to Marine systems; Marine systems first quarter was superb, as the shipyards continue to far outperform expectations. Sales and operating earnings improved in each shipyard when compared to both the first and fourth quarters of 2008. Operating earnings grew nicely or grew nearly 34%, significantly outpacing the group’s strong 21% sales growth in the quarter.  The operating margins improved 90 basis points over the first quarter 2008, and this tremendous operating leverage is particularly impressive because it is the result of improved execution across the board on the programs at each of the shipyards, including Virginia class submarines, DDG-51 destroyers, TAKE and the commercial product carrier. The Marine Group’s backlog was $25.5 billion at quarter end. Backlog does not include the two additional DDG-1000s and one additional DDG-51 that were mentioned as part of Secretary Gates budget preview remarks. These ships when under contract will provide Bath Iron Work, with workload stability for many years to come.  With this strong performance under their belt, I feel confident that the Marine group will achieve the 9.7% to 9.8% margins that were implicit in my previous guidance to you. Early indications suggest that our sales guidance of 5.5% to 6% was conservative, and that volume could provide some significant upside here, together with some possibility that they’ll outperform on the margin front.  On the defense side, the last business or groups that we’ll speak to are information systems and technology. First quarter sales for IS and P grew 16% over the same quarter last year. The organic growth rate was 13.7%. All three North American based businesses bested not only their first quarter 2008 sales and operating earnings, but fourth quarter 2008 as well.  A shift in the group’s contract mix resulted in a 50 basis point decrease in operating earnings compared with the year ago quarter. The group’s 10.6% margin performance however exceeded my expectation. I’m pleased to report that this is a result of strong execution across all of the businesses.  Book-to-bill for the group was 1.1 this quarter, continuing a pattern of strong demand for IS&T’s products and services. The group’s order intake exceeded one to one in three of the previous four quarters and was 1.12 for the full year 2008. This growing backlog positions IS&T for continued strength in 2009 and beyond. So they’re off to a great start. I believe IS&T will achieve, if not better, the 8% revenue growth we have forecasted. They also have some opportunity to outperform my original guidance of 30 to 40 basis points margin compression from last year’s 10.7 average.  Last, Aerospace; the aerospace group held its own this quarter. A noteworthy accomplishment I think, in light of business market conditions. While conditions are by no means good, I am pleased to report that they have improved materially from what we experienced in February. Positive data points from our Gulfstream team include improved Gulfstream flying hours, signs of thawing in the pre-owned market, and increased customer interest in new orders.  The addition of jet aviation to the group’s results caused sales to grow 13.8% year-over-year. Gulfstream’s revenues were down, although inline with our expectations, given our planned production cuts. Gulfstream’s service volume was also down, although modestly less than 9%. By the way, Gulfstream’s revenues were down in the area of 8.5%, probably should have mentioned that.  New aircraft deliveries in the quarter were consistent with our production plan for the year, as we were able to cover defaulted contracts with new orders or move up buyers. All but one aircraft for first quarter delivery delivered as planned. That one, a G-550, a white tail at quarter end, now is under contract and will deliver in the second quarter.  The group’s operating earnings were impacted by several irregular or unusual items at Gulfstream, including employee severance costs about $10 million, lower launch assistance payments than we had received first quarter a year ago, lower by about $12 million, and negative fair market value adjustments on four pre-owned aircraft in inventory, totaling $21 million.  These negative items were partially offset by receipt of payments for liquidated damages on defaulted contracts, totaling approximately $30 million. I think in that mouthful, I’ve given you the four sort of unusual items in the quarter that you can use to balance your evaluation of performance.  We had seven pre-owned aircraft in inventory at the end of the quarter and there are five additional inputs anticipated through the remainder of the year. While that is higher than recent years, we have significantly reduced our pre-owned exposure, compared to the last downturn.  The group’s operating margins were 13.7% in the quarter. Margins were pressured obviously by the addition of jet aviation and to a lesser extent the aforementioned pre-owned aircraft charges. Margins in the group would have been 15.2% without pre-owned.  We are working very aggressively to integrate and improve upon jet aviation’s performance, particularly in their completions work. I believe that jet will improve their operating earnings contribution in each quarter during the year.  Gulfstream’s new aircraft margins were actually up in the quarter. Even when we exclude all unusual items that bear upon new aircraft margins, new margins were slightly improved when compared to the year ago quarter; an impressive performance in this market. Gulfstream book-to-bill expressed in dollars was 0.6 times for the quarter, as modest order activity was outpaced by aircraft deliveries and some customer defaults.  All totaled, the backlog eroded somewhat in the first three months of the year, ending the quarter at $20.8 billion. Over the last several weeks, the backlog has stabilized significantly, and I believe there is less risk to our production plan for this year and next, than when we announced the production cuts in early March.  I expect the second quarter at aerospace to be as good as or better than the first. As you know, we plan to furlough the manufacturing workforce at Gulfstream this summer, which will make the third quarter weaker. Our furlough approach is well received by the employee base, and it affords us a great deal of flexibility to adjust duration based on the level of order activity. So for example, if new order activity improves, we will shorten the furlough period.  I feel confident that we are proactively confronting the spectrum of challenges presented by the current business jet market conditions. I am pleased to report that new aircraft development is on track, and I expect that the G-650 will fly before year end. I believe that current market conditions and backlog stability support the production levels set for 2009, with some modest upside potential in 2010.  I think, in short this was a very good quarter for us. The defense segments mature and developing product portfolio address both conventional and irregular warfare requirements, consistent with the views expressed by Secretary Gates, while the aerospace business is continuing to invest in new products and technologies that will entice business jet customers for years to come. In short, I believe that our backlog, healthy balance sheet and diverse products and services position General Dynamics to benefit from myriad opportunities in all of its markets.  Before I take your questions, I’d like Hugh Redd, our CFO, to fill in some details that may be of interest to you.
Hugh Redd: Thank you, Nick. Interest expense for the quarter was $39 million; it was twice the amount for the first quarter of 2008. The increase in interest expense is a result of increased net debt required to fund acquisitions and share repurchases during 2008.  Additionally, during the first quarter of 2009, we repurchased 2.1 million shares and completed a minor acquisition in the IS&T segment. As a result, net debt increased just over $300 million, and notwithstanding this increase in net debt, we still expect the interest expense to approximate $150 million for the full year.  On the tax rate, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.8%, consistent with our expectations. For the full year we continue to expect the rate to approximate 31.5%. During the first quarter of 2009, our return on invested capital and return on equity improved 40 basis points and 70 basis points respectively. ROIC was 150 basis points better, and our return on equity, ROE, was 200 basis points better than one year ago.  Finally, I want to point out that in the press release, Exhibit H to be a little more precise, we presented Gulfstream only data to facilitate your year-over-year comparison. We’ll have to rethink that disclosure and we have a full quarter of jet aviation in both the current and previous years, but again, we’ve given you Gulfstream-only data for your comparison purposes.  Amy that completes all my remarks.
Amy Gilliland: Thank you, Hugh. Before I move to the question-and-answer period, I’d like to ask participants to ask only one question, so that everyone has an opportunity to participate this morning. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue.  Dan, could you just please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Questions-and-Answers: 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wachovia. Please proceed.
Sam Pearlstein - Wachovia Securities: Good morning. Nick, I just wanted to follow up on Marine. To what extent was this an acceleration and a timing issue versus real improvement, because I’m trying to just reconcile the growth this quarter with a 5%, 5.5% growth year, which I know you say is conservative and trying to think about the moving pieces as we go through the year. 
Nick Chabraja: Sam, I can’t see any move ahead. I parsed that. This is a conversation I’m going to be having with Dave Hebner and the shipyard Presidents, but it would appear to me that the volume is repeatable, but I haven’t gotten to ground truth yet. The margins were what I had anticipated and they reflect the modest booking rate increases, pretty much across the product base from production efficiencies, but I’m not prepared as you could tell from my earlier remarks, to declare victory on revenue volume just yet, until I work that issue a little further.
Sam Pearlstein - Wachovia Securities: Okay, thanks. I’ll stick with one.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Hi. Nice quarter. 
Nick Chabraja: Thank you, Noah. 
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: At combat, you’ve talked about a lot of opportunities there. It seems like the range of outcomes here is pretty wide. You just mentioned the Saudi and the direct Iraq sales. Maybe update us on some of the opportunities that arose during the quarter, specifically what the FCS vehicle cancellation means for you in the near term, what the sole source removal on ECB2 means for you potentially and where we stand on METB?
Nick Chabraja: That’s a whole mouthful I guess. I don’t know what to say about future combat system. We continue to work on FCS under our existing contract. I don’t have enough clarity; we’re not faced with any stop work order, so we’re proceeding with the research and development work that we previously have been doing.  You know the outcome of the Army’s deliberations, with respect to their future combat vehicles, you know more than I do. My understanding is that the Army is working that close quarters and they’re discussing it with the Secretary, but not with industry. So I can’t shed any light on that.  I think most of our programmatic activity is moving ahead, as anticipated. I didn’t see anything particularly unusual. Most of the upside to our plan comes from international order activity and the potential for it. To say that something cropped up in the quarter is unusual. Things don’t usually crop up in this business, they develop over time and we’ve been talking about the Saudi Arabian potential.  Yes, I guess the 140 tanks for Iraq, maybe we could say that grew in the quarter, but there have been discussion before then. There’s an option for another 140. The MRAP ATV opportunity I think is probably first surfaced publicly in the quarter, but there had been discussion in the past.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: What transpired on ECB2, an opportunity for GD? 
Nick Chabraja: Look, there’s a lot of opportunities out there and what happens with joint tactical vehicle and the split of vehicles. I think Noah, until the Army gives clarity to their modernization program, with respect to wheeled and tracked vehicles, any answer I give you or any speculation that you bake into your analysis is dice rolling, we just don’t know. It’s going to be a robust market; that we know. What it will be made of, we don’t know. So let’s wait for the Army to tell us and then we can all handle it.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Fair enough. Thanks, Nick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Broadpoint AmTech; please proceed.
Peter Arment - Broadpoint AmTech: Good morning. Nice results. Nick, maybe this falls in the dice rolling category also, but Ohio class replacement was mentioned with Secretary Gates and this is clearly a long term opportunity, but has there been any details discussed on how they plan to move forward with that and what actual funding will be involved?
Nick Chabraja: We have for some time Peter, been at work with our ally, the United Kingdom, on the design or portions of the design work of a replacement to the Ohio class, and I was pleased and encouraged by the Secretary’s public remarks on something that had been reasonably quiet until then and we look forward to more detail when we see the FY ‘10 budget. 
Peter Arment - Broadpoint AmTech: Okay, and just quickly, if I could quickly follow up. I guess on IS&T, cyber security made a lot of headlines and I know you’re in a lot of classified areas, but is there any general color how you see any incremental funding coming through for you?
Nick Chabraja: I don’t think so. I think we’ve been a significant player in that world, and I think to give you a little color, we generate about $1 billion annually, in the general subject of keeping intruders out of US computer networks and encrypting military communications.  So that gives you an idea of the size of our participation in the market. We do that through a number of programs, mostly classified, and I think probably I’ve said enough on that subject. We don’t do a lot of crowing about cyber security, but I think we’re a pretty strong participant.
Peter Arment - Broadpoint AmTech: Good enough. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies & company. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co: Thank you very much. Nick, just to go to Gulfstream for a moment, you provided a little bit of color about the market getting better, could you add a little bit of depth to that in terms of customers coming back and dialogues becoming richer and what do you think the customers have seen, that’s giving them confidence again to use the product?
Nick Chabraja: I don’t know that I can get into the customer’s mind Howard, but look, the most important thing from our perspective is we had a terrible blood letting in February, with a number of defaults and requests for cancellation, and requests to be further back in line. That created an enormous amount of work and energy and caused us to change our production plan. We were able to handle that I think, and we see that activity has quieted, and we have more confidence in the remainder of the backlog, now that we’ve been through this sort of purging. What I can tell you Howard, is what another major shock to the economy would do, but absent that, we have a higher degree of confidence in this backlog, now that there’s been some pruning gone on. We see buyers returning to the market. I have no idea what gives them confidence.  There are sort of two markets in creation out there; one is a spot market, where the prices are slightly off, sometimes more than slightly. Then for our aircraft, there’s a longer term regular market to participate in the ordinary way in the backlog. Those prices are remaining reasonably firm. So there are buyers with different motives.  Some buyers who might otherwise be buying pre-owned aircraft and see an opportunity to get a new airplane at distressed prices and may be taking advantage of default environments as replacement buyers. Those buyers don’t get to configure the plane themselves or get to outfit it just the way they might have done it, but they find the purchase point attractive in that venue.  We’re happy to see those kinds of buyers, because they help us, and frankly they help the party who’s in default to get through what probably is a tough economic environment, but we’ve seen that occur, and we’ve seen people now expressing more interest in product in the normal course.  So I don’t know; I can’t put myself in the heads of these customers and I don’t personally deal with them, but they’re reappearing, albeit slowly. I don’t want to claim victory here. It is much, much too early.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co: Was this book-to-bill, was it spread across the product line or was it more area more than another?
Nick Chabraja: No, it was spread across the product line Howard, and it was very helpful.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen& Co.; please proceed.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.: Yes, thank you. Good quarter, Nick. Could you give us some more color on where R&D was? It looks like it was up year-over-year, specifically in Gulfstream.
Nick Chabraja: Yes, it was. I’ll give it to you here in a minute, as soon as I can lay my hands on it. 
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.: The other part of the question was, maybe give us some color going forward on employee severance. Is there more to come? Launch assistance, should you catch up or slip from the first quarter. Thank you.
Nick Chabraja: Cai I’m going to answer the first part of your question first and then I’ll ask you to repeat the second part, but yes, the Research and Development dollars were up about $17 million quarter-over-quarter and that’s a net figure.  You might remember in my remarks, I alluded to the fact that launch assistance was down $12 million, so that made the spread on net R&D dollars broader, but on gross dollars, we spent about five more than we had a year before, but from an economic point of view, you’re quite correct. This was significantly more than a year ago, near double.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.: Okay, and the second part of the question was looking forward, should the R&D decline as we go through the year and should we see more severance expenses?
Nick Chabraja: Our spending will remain reasonably constant. What you will see in the R&D category is more or less launch assistance by quarter. So that will be spotty and so I can’t predict for you right at the moment how it will be each quarter, but we’ll continue to spend at the pace that’s reflected in our first quarter results.  You will see more severance in the second quarter, because this severance took care of the first trench of cuts that we had planned and designated and identified. There will be a second grouping that will be executed in the quarter. If the layoffs don’t take place, the plan will be fully developed and identified, the employees who will leave, and that will be the end of the riffs. We will then do whatever adjusting to our production is required through furlough and that will be in the third quarter.  You may have heard in my opening remarks that I try to take all of that, roll it into a ball and say that I expect in aerospace the second quarter results to be as good as or better than this quarter. Third quarter results down as a result of the furlough and fewer deliveries in the quarter, to pick back up again in the fourth quarter.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.: Terrific. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Merrill Lynch; please proceed.
Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Yes. Good morning, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: Good morning Ron.
Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Can you follow up on I guess another quick Gulfstream follow-up question: what did you see with regard to the customer reaction to the G-600 in the economic downturn? I mean, did you see anybody backing away from it or is it still so far out there that folks are still okay?
Nick Chabraja: We lost a couple and picked up a couple in the quarter, so that I think our backlog with G-650 is up marginally, and I think the backlog’s holding tough. We’ll see the first 50 or so have a payment due when we fly. We’ll see whether that holds up, but the customer interest remains tremendous and the principal inquiry we get is, “are you on schedule?” 
Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch: And that was my follow-on; how is that going?
Nick Chabraja: We’re in pretty good shape. We’re going to fly it before the end of the year.
Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Super. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Campbell from Barclays Capital; please proceed.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Good morning, it’s actually Carter Copeland and Joe Campbell.
Nick Chabraja: Good morning Joe and Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Nick, I wondered if we could ask you briefly about the performance of the two large acquired businesses, AxleTech and jet. You said you expected jet to get better over the course of the year, but any color there on how they performed in the quarter and what sort of improvements we expect to see in the year would be helpful.
Nick Chabraja: Yes, I think AxleTech performed very, very well. They have a commercial segment in their business, which experienced some volume issues, but they’re performing well, and I think will continue to perform better. There’s some obvious synergies between AxleTech and our group of businesses.  Jet aviation, volume was off slightly. I think it came in two parts. The MRO business experienced some softness just like Gulfstream did. The maintenance service business, they were off neighborhood of 10% from their expectations. In other respects, revenue was off principally as a result of foreign exchange, the relationship of the Swiss Franc to the dollar.  In operations, as I indicated earlier we were disappointed. We’re taking aggressive action there to integrate and boost their operating managerial talent and get them back on track and we have no question, but that will be accomplished.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Did the business make money in the quarter, Nick?
Nick Chabraja: Yes, it made money. Sure it did.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein; please proceed.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: On IS&T, could you walk through the three US units and describe what the drivers are that led to this good performance and how you see that playing out over the year?
Nick Chabraja: I don’t know how it’s going to play out during the year. Volume was up at all three significantly, driven by a lot of programmatic activity, most significantly at AIS, but it’s a potpourri of products and programs and I don’t know that it would further the discussion much for me to parse that. This is not a business like the big platform businesses, where we have two or three programs that drive our results. This is one where we have 5,000 and 6,000 contract line items over a given time.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Well, what I was getting at is, are you seeing some trends you mentioned? There’s some benefits in the encryption arena before and I know in C4 systems you certainly do have a few larger programs like WinT. I was just wondering if there was anything you could point to here?
Nick Chabraja: No. One quarter doesn’t a trend make, and if we were going to make a trend out of anything, it would be out of my remarks that in four of the last five quarters, we’ve had a book-to-bill that exceeded one. If you’ve been following this for a while, I’ve had a long running dialogue with my friend, George Shapiro, who no longer provides coverage, about where was the organic growth in IS&T.  Well, finally we got it, and it came from those orders, all of which we publish with great regularity and you follow and they finally got funded by way of revenue.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: It looks like they’re getting funded better than even you thought though. 
Nick Chabraja: That is true. More importantly, they’re funded better than they thought and they’re getting some wins out there and they’re managing to get some of their programs funded in the ordinary course and we’re seeing some of those awards now finding their way into sales and earnings, for which we’re grateful. If George were still here, I’d point that out to him with some significant vigor.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Well, great. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Oppenheimer; please proceed.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer: Thanks, good morning, and good quarter Nick. Apologize if you did say it, but can you provide the expectation for full year volume and margins at Gulfstream?
Nick Chabraja: I don’t even want to guess right now. I think it’s consistent with the guidance we gave you earlier. I think this is too tough. We’re going to work it, so that we get enough EBIT to make the guidance that was implicit the last time around that we talked about that, but what the volume will actually be is too hard. For example, in the quarter, we didn’t have one pre-owned sale.  I don’t know what kind of guesstimate I have to make here for you and the margins are so variable depending on what’s in and what’s out, but they’re working around an EBIT that looks like $650 million at Gulfstream, and I believe that they will come very close to that. Beyond that, I don’t really have anything to say.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer: Can I squeeze in one, which is the cancellations in the quarter; what was the dollar level of the cancellations? I think the book-to-bill you quoted was probably gross book-to-bill; is that right?
Nick Chabraja: Book-to-bill is all orders in the quarter, less deliveries. So I don’t know the total dollar volume; I haven’t parsed that. Somebody probably knows it, but I don’t know that, that’s not a metric that’s interesting to me.  You used the word cancellation, we didn’t have any cancellations, we had some defaults, and those defaults were covered either through securing another buyer and the delta made up with uniform commercial code cover damages or in some other fashion, but we haven’t permitted cancellation of any of our contracts. We’ve renegotiated some, but cancellation is a term that’s foreign to our vernacular.  We went through this in 2002, 2003. As a result, we’ve been significantly more disciplined about our contract activity, and part of the reason that I’m feeling some stability in that backlog is our good customers have found out what those terms and conditions mean and that they’re bound by them.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JP Morgan; please proceed.
Joe Nadol - JP Morgan: Thanks, good afternoon Nick. My question is over at Marine, you came to a deal with the Pentagon on DDG-1000 and some swaps. I’m wondering if you could comment on the swap and particularly on the report that you accepted a fixed price contract on the second DDG-1000.
Nick Chabraja: The so-called swap, I don’t know if that’s an appropriate name for it. There’s a realignment requested by the Pentagon, by the Department of Defense, Department of Navy, with respect to the DDG-1000.  They preferred that all three of those boats be built at the Bath Iron Works and there was in addition, three additional DDG-51s that were identified, one in fiscal year 2010 and two in FY ’11; two of those to go to Northrup Grumman Ship Systems and one to Bath Iron Works. That is the broad outline of the so-called swap. Now, with respect to contracting activity, Bath Iron Works has the first DDG-1000 under contract on a cost plus basis. We have expressed a willingness, in response to an inquiry of the Department of the Navy, to enter in to fixed price contracts on the second and third boat; they have not done so. 
Joe Nadol - JP Morgan: Sorry to interrupt, but can you speak to your willingness to get into fixed price, given the history of fixed price contracts in shipbuilding, which we’re all very familiar with?
Nick Chabraja: In my history, that’s the only way to make money. We did spectacularly on the product carrier. We’ve done okay on TAKE-1. This is the most mature design we’ve ever been asked to build, ever, including the Virginia class. This is a complete design.  We’ve tested that design by building modules. We’re comfortable with it and we’re comfortable with our estimating ability. I’m not as comfortable that the parties will reach agreement, but we’re willing to do it, just as we were willing to do it on the secondary combat ship and we couldn’t come to an agreement the first time through. We will, I think this time, but its part of the risk of being a ship builder, and it’s a risk that I feel very comfortable with here.  I sat through the red team reviews of the estimating, together with Mike Toner. We had this done across the entirety of the group, with a lot of good give and take and I feel very comfortable that this is not a parametric analysis that our ship builders have done, but it’s an analysis based on the existing design, their work and the work we’ve done in the shipyard to prepare ourselves for these ships. So if we can come to agreement on price, we’ll do it. If we can’t, we won’t.
Joe Nadol - JP Morgan: Okay. Nick, on another note, is this our last earnings call with you or do you plan to participate in July and going forward?
Nick Chabraja: This to my regret is my swan song Joe, thanks for asking. 
Joe Nadol - JP Morgan: Well, it’s been wonderful over the years working with you and to think we’ve had 40 something calls with you, so thanks for everything.
Nick Chabraja: Thank you. Thanks for the memories. I’ve been doing this with you guys I think for 12 years, maybe 13; I did it a little bit when I was Executive Vice President. Jay and Hugh will have the great privilege of carrying on our tradition of discussions, but thanks a lot; I’ve enjoyed it a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Macquarie; please proceed.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Good afternoon. 
Nick Chabraja: Hi Rob, how are you?
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Great thanks, and you?
Nick Chabraja: Good. 
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: I’d like the to echo Joe’s comments as well; we’ll miss you, Nick. As we put all your comments together regarding the divisions and the performance you put up for Q1, how do you feel about your EPS guidance that you issued of $6 or $6.10 for this year?
Nick Chabraja: Look Rob, I think we’re clearly not backing off that guidance. I saw in some of the commentary that people might have been expecting lower guidance, we’re clearly not, and I think I’ve painted a picture where there’s some upside potential.  If we asked ourselves the questions that are out there, I think they’ve been asked in part. What are the drivers? Will the Marine group volume hold up at the kind of growth that they enjoyed this quarter? Are we looking at a volume that’s four times this quarter’s revenue? So their operating earnings will be up and that’s a more important driver to them, than whether or not they can eke out another 20 basis points of margin.  On the IS&T side, same question; will the growth hold up through the year and will they be able to outperform on the margin guidance I’ve given you? They’re ahead of it now by about 30 basis points. Here operating margin is more important, because of the size of the base. When you’re talking about a business that’s well in excess of $10 billion, starting to get 30 or 40 basis points makes a big difference. Combat systems, I think the volume is there. The issue there is will they make the 12.5% margins that we guided you to, given that they’re down in the quarter about 11.6, but remember on that question, I guided you to about 110 basis points lower than last year’s average and if you apply that 110 basis point discount across each of last year’s four quarters, you would have come out this quarter about 11.9.  So that tells me we’re kind of tracking, but a little bit below where I’d like to see it and I’ve got a couple of belly buttons where I could touch and feel it, that I talked to you about. One was the MRAP, that didn’t sustain itself after the early quarters last year, and the other was a little bit weak performance in Europe in the quarter that I expect to rally, but those are the big moving pieces.  I think Gulfstream is going to come out okay. I think they’re going to do pretty much what they promised on the replant, once we shrunk the production planning and I have a high degree of confidence that we’ll produce and deliver the 73 large Gulfstreams that we put in that replay. I think the financial metrics look okay. Maybe we can get a little juice out of this and we can beat a little more money out of jet aviation, but I think those are the moving parts. So they could permit someone to forecast more, but I’m not prepared to do that right now and Jay may get the opportunity to speak to this into the second quarter, which is sort of when we traditionally give you a lets see if we have an update.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: That’s great. Thanks so much Nick. 
Amy Gilliland: I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse; please proceed.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Well Nick, it’s been a lot of fun, but before you go, perhaps a question on cash flow and this may be for you or for Hugh actually, I’m not sure. You alluded to the weakness in the quarter and the seasonal recovery we should expect, but perhaps you can speak specifically to the very weak advances and the mechanics of how that flows through Gulfstream and I think you mentioned jet as well.  While talking about that, maybe you could talk about these default transactions and the mechanics of how those work, where I suspect the customer that moves in pays a highly discounted price, offset by the deposit forfeited by the other customer.
Nick Chabraja: Let’s talk first about cash. Gulfstream and jet were both users of cash for somewhat different reasons. In jet’s case, it was the operations, not meeting operational milestones that enabled them to collect cash on major projects; so operational improvement and just ordinary performance timing issue for them in getting to the milestones and collecting the money. In Gulfstream’s case, it’s a highly complicated pattern, in part working off cash advances, in part returning cash to customers who forfeited liquidated damages. So we collected some $30 million in liquidated damages under contracts in the quarter, and I don’t know how much we returned to those very same people, but it was considerable.  Some of our contracts call for liquidated damages as opposed to a cover remedy. Those are typically contracts further out. You asked about a UCC cover remedy; if you are in default, it is my obligation or the Gulfstream’s obligation to mitigate your damages, which they do by finding a buyer. In most instances, the customer approves the price that we sell it at. We don’t have to seek their approval, but we have to be able to demonstrate that we made a good faith effort to mitigate their damages, and that we got them the best price we could in that spot market environment.  In most instances, these customers have been satisfied with the effort we made and have agreed with us that the price that we sold their position for was satisfactory and when the transaction closed, we returned their money, apart from the cover remedy itself, the damages.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: So they absorbed some difference between the new price and the original price?
Nick Chabraja: That’s exactly right. It’s called cover. 
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: And should we conclude then, that these buyers that are moving forward, are finding these newer prices competitive with what these heavily discounted aircrafts looked like on the secondary market because as you mentioned, you noted…
Nick Chabraja: Bob, I have no idea what they think or what they do, but they’ve stepped up with money. 
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: One would have to think it’s not too different a number for that to have happened.
Nick Chabraja: Why speculate about it? I mean, they did it. 
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: The advances being as negative as they were, this is mostly progress payments, not deposits associated with the newer orders?
Nick Chabraja: It’s working off progress payments that we have received, not having an order activity that refreshes that advanced payment, some slippage in progress payments. I mean it’s a build-up of seven aircraft and three of them that are sitting in pre-owned inventory instead of in cash. So a lot of different chunks of this, but we expect it to cure.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks Nick.
Operator: At this time, this concludes our Q-and-A session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Amy Gilliland for closing remarks.
Amy Gilliland: I want to thank you for joining the call today and if you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3748. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2008 General Dynamics Earnings Call. My name is Dan and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today’s call, Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Amy Gilliland : Thank you Dan and good morning everyone. Welcome to General Dynamics Fourth Quarter conference call. I want to remind listeners that as always any forward-looking statements made today, represent our best estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Chabraja.
Nick Chabraja : Thank you, Amy and good morning. The press release I think is pretty straightforward, together with the accompanying charts. So I will try to go through the prosaic information briefly for those who have not seen the press release and spend more time giving you color on segment information, my own views about performance, and because we had an acquisition of Jet Aviation in the quarter, there is a touch of absence of transparency or at least the Gulfstream figures are slightly obscured. I will try and shed some light on that for you and then give you by segment some forward-looking information that builds towards our guidance for the year. With that said I am pleased to report that General Dynamics Corporation had yet another strong quarter completing an outstanding year from an operating point of view. We beat the consensus for the quarter and for the year rather aptly and it is a consensus that it built during the year.  Sales in the quarter were $7.9 billion, a 4.5% growth rate over what was you might remember a very powerful fourth quarter in 2007. Net earnings from continuing operations were $630 million, an increase of 9% over that same fourth quarter in 2007.  Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.62 for the quarter, a 14% increase over the same quarter last year. For the full year, sales were $29.3 billion, a 7.6% increase over 2007. Net earnings from continuing operations were $2.48 billion, a 19.1% increase over the prior year and full year earnings per share from continuing operations were $6.22, a 22% increase year-over-year. This is obviously a powerful story of improved margins and operating leverage, but it is also a story about efficient conversion of earnings into cash. Free cash flow from operations defined as net cash from continuing operations after capital contribution was $629 million for the quarter and $2.6 billion for the year. This is a conversion rate of 100% of net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter and 106% for the full year.  It has been thus for the last five years, I think, probably for years before that, but I do not have the data in front of me. It is also a phenomenal backlog story by any measure. Order intake has been strong all year and was particularly strong during the fourth quarter. In fact, the order intake this quarter, which totaled $22.2 billion, is the largest during my tenure at General Dynamics.  As a result, our total backlog stands a little over $74 billion at year-end. If you add to that, the value of unexercised options which some companies include in backlog, we do not, and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts, the total estimated contract value at year-end was $91 billion. Let me now get to the segment detail and lay a little ground work for our 2009 guidance that we provided in the press release. I will begin with combat systems. The Combat Systems Group recorded sales of $2.3 billion in the quarter, down somewhat from the fourth quarter of 2007, due primarily to very heavy sales in 2007 of the Cougar Variant MRAP vehicle, the Chameleon IED defeat system and the Pander program in the Czech Republic; all of which did not recur in the Fourth Quarter of 2008. The Czech program which was stalled during all of 2008 I am pleased to report is back on track for 2009. On the other hand, margin rates for the quarter were 13.2%, 100 basis points improved over the fourth quarter last year, due primarily to operating performance improvements in the subsystems business, the ammunition business and several of our European product lines.  For the full year, sales were up 5.1% and operating earnings 21.3%. This result was driven by year-over-year margin improvement of really a staggering 190 basis points. Combat Systems generated operating earnings in excess of $1.1 billion, their first time over a billion in operating earnings. In fact, Combat Systems was our operating earnings leader for the year. The year-end backlog for Combat stands at $15 billion, over $12 billion which is fully funded. This strong backlog almost equaled the two years of sales. Positions Combat System for very strong sales growth in 2009 in a range between 20% to 25%.  You should be mindful that that increase will also be aided by the acquisition of AxleTech, which closed at the end of the fourth quarter. On the other hand, margins of 13.6% in this segment are not sustainable. We think margins in the mid 12 range are more reasonable to expect. This will still result in a very handsome pick up in operating earnings for Combat Systems for 2009. The Marine Group. I am extremely proud of the performance of the Marine Group. In the quarter, sales were $1.4 billion, a 13.3% increase over 2007. More importantly, operating earnings increased 30.7% to $132 million. Margins for the quarter were 9.6%.  For the full year, sales and operating earnings increased 11.3% and 23.8% respectively. Margins for the full year were 9.4%. During the quarter, Electric Boat was awarded a contract worth $13.8 billion for Block 3 of the Virginia Class Submarine. Orders across the segment totaled $16.9 billion resulting in a backlog of $26.4 billion at year-end. This backlog supports Marine Systems' continuing growth with particularly significant rates of growth in 2010 and 2011. On a personal note, the Marine Group has grown faster, improved margins sooner and positioned itself better than I had expected. Sales growth in 2009 in my view should be between 5.5% and 6% with some modest improvement in margins, perhaps 30-40 basis points. We will see faster growth and even better margins in 2010. The IS&T group, the fourth quarter sales in the IS&T area grew 6.8% over the same quarter a year ago. 75% of that growth was organic. The other 25% supported by acquisition. Margin rates for the quarter declined 70 basis points, resulting in flat operating earnings compared to the fourth quarter 2007. As most of you will recall, particularly our sell-side analysts, we had forecasted a margin decline in the fourth quarter due to mix shift.  Sales and earnings for the full year each grew about 4.5%. Margin rates were slightly higher than we had expected. We had originally guided you to a decline of 20-30 basis points for the year; however, margins held constant year-over-year at 10.7%. The backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contracts grew 11.8% during the year, positioning IS&T for continued growth in 2009. In fact, I see this segment growing about 8% next year but with margins 30-40 basis points lower than 2008.  Let me pause here to summarize the defense businesses. We have a balanced defense portfolio which is positioned well for the foreseeable future. Sales should continue to grow at reasonable rates, with margins sustainable at levels between 2007 and 2008 performance. I see a very solid defense business.  If I could characterize my guidance to you, with respect to these three business segments, I would say it is the same as always, a touch on the conservative side and you will perceive it that way. Let me turn lastly to aerospace and maybe spend most of the time that I have with you on that subject. In the context of the economy in general, and the business aviation market in particular, the fourth quarter was very strong. First of all, sales were $1.5 billion, an increase of 26.5% year-over-year. Now let me help you here. 11.4% of that growth was organic or Gulfstream growth. As you know we completed the acquisition of Jet Aviation during the quarter so almost two months of Jet’s results are included. Operating earnings were $264 million, an increase of 24.5%. However, margin rates were down 30 basis points as a result of the addition of Jet Aviation. The margin rate from Gulfstream alone in the quarter was 18.7%, 40 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year, sales were $5.5 billion, a 14.2% increase over 2007 and again 75% of that growth was organic, the rest attributable to two months of Jet Aviation. Operating earnings were over $1 billion as margin rates expanded by 170 basis points to end at 18.5% for the total year. I should add that Gulfstream alone exceeded $1 billion of operating earnings for the first time and we are cautiously optimistic that they will do even better in 2009. Deliveries were strong in the quarter with 41 green aircraft; 38 completions. Order intake was stronger than you might expect. In the quarter the book-to-bill ratio for new aircraft expressed in dollars was 1.13 times.  Having said that, we did experience some defaults during the quarter. As a result, the Gulfstream backlog. Gulfstream alone decreased margins. However the addition of just shy of $0.75 billion of Jet Aviation backlog increased the backlog for the group. Let's take a more detailed look at how we expect aerospace to perform in 2009 with a particular emphasis on Gulfstream. Let me begin this syllogism by taking a look at Gulfstream in 2008.  We had a total of 156 green deliveries, 87 of them large cabin and 69 mid size. This year, 2009, as a result of what I view to be a dramatic softening particularly in the mid size market and a shorter backlog in that segment, we plan to deliver approximately 30 mid size aircraft cutting production by slightly more than 50%.  I say approximately because we have not yet set the production rate for the G200 and in this segment, we are particularly flexible. As you also know, these are our lower margin aircraft. On the other hand, we plan to deliver 94 large cabin aircraft; an increase of seven of our higher margin aircraft. This is a total of 124 for the year but with a distinctly favorable mix shift. Our plan to deliver and produce at this rate in 2009 and probably 2010 as well, with respect to the larger bodies is supported by contract backlog of 215 in production, large cabin aircraft for green delivery and an additional 31 for completion. This is 246 airplane backlog of in production large cabin aircraft, which alone gives us over 2.5 years of entry into service and deliveries, at the proposed rate of production. We work this backlog as you might imagine very hard in the quarter and have a high degree of confidence in its durability. It will not be without issues as we go forward, particularly if the economic climate worsens. At this point, we have a firm conviction that we can manage through the anticipated issues.  Of the defaults we had in the quarter, six related to the large cabin in production backlog, a relatively small percentage of the number of units under contract. We had other buyers in the backlog who moved up to replace those who defaulted. Some of you might have observed we were a few units shy of our anticipated deliveries in the year. That was not as a result of these defaults, but resulted from the implications of the strike at Vought, our airplane wing supplier on the 450 product. So we actually had about three deliveries in the queue that we could not get airplane wings for. That fact in reality provides some upside to the potential of 94 deliveries in 2009 but for the moment it is something we are going to hold in abeyance and see how the year plays out. For the group, I think it is reasonable to expect revenue to grow by as much as 25% largely as a result of the Jet Aviation introduction into our line. For the same reason, margins will be lower than 2008 for the group, perhaps the mid 16% range is the place to look. Now let me put the defense piece together with aerospace to give you a consolidated view of 2009. Overall sales will grow approximately 15%, just shy of $34 billion. Margins will be in the high, very high 11% range operating margins; maybe get to 12%. As a result, operating earnings will grow about 10%.  With those building blocks in mind, I am expecting earnings per share from continuing operations in a range from 670-675, an increase of approximately 8% over a really outstanding 2008.  Let me at this point before we get to your questions ask our CFO, Hugh Redd to fill in some additional detail, maybe make reference to the discontinued operations at Murcia in Spain before we get at your questions. Hugh?
Hugh Redd : Thank you, Nick. Let me start with interest expense. For the quarter it was $24 million and $66 million for the full year. Interest expense increased during the fourth quarter due to the acquisition of Jet Aviation and Axle Tech. Both those transactions were completed in the fourth quarter. Additionally we spent $335 million in the quarter repurchasing 5.6 million shares. So for the full year, we spent $1.5 billion to repurchase 20 million shares. During the quarter net debt increased by $2.9 billion primarily as a result of the acquisitions. Accordingly, we expect interest expense to increase to between $140 million and $150 million in 2009. I will address the tax rate which for the fourth quarter was 32.1%, for the full year, 31.2%, given that performance and what we expect for 2009, it is reasonable to estimate the tax rate to be between 31.5% and 32% for the full year. Next, I will address discontinued operations. During the quarter General Dynamics recorded a one-time, $18 million after-tax charge in discontinued operations which related to the anticipated sale of a business line in Europe as Nick said in Murcia, Spain in particular. Of that amount, $11 million is attributable to the anticipated loss on the transaction and $7 million attributable to the loss on the operations. Let me say in closing that return on invested capital increased to 18.5% which is an increase of 160 basis points year-over-year. A return on equity increased 190 basis points to end at 21.4% for the same period for the fourth quarter of 2008. Amy that completes my comments this morning.
Amy Gilliland : Thank you, Hugh. Before we move to the question and answer period I just want to ask participants to please ask only one question; so that everyone has a chance to participate this morning. If you have an additional question, please get back into the queue. Dan, with that, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jeffries & Company. Please proceed 
Howard Rubel - Jeffries & Company: Thank you very much. Nick, I do have to ask a little bit about Gulfstream even though it is only one part of the company. As you look at dealing with some of the risks beyond '09, what variables are you considering? I am very impressed that you say the rate is you are fully sold out but we had some unexpected cancellations. How are you gauging that risk?
Nick Chabraja: Howard, I do not know that they are unexpected given the state of the general economy and a particular factor that is growing in importance has really been an absence of financing for aircraft transactions. I would say no financing that I am aware of for pre-owned activity and while there is some struggling financing going on with respect to new aircraft, I would say there is an absence of benchmarking or uniformity with respect to underwriting standards, so it is a little difficult to understand what the banks want to do, how they want to do it and how to put customers together with banks.  So given that macro environment that we are all very much aware of, and the problems of the banks, one would anticipate some unsettling issues in the backlog, and we work them real hard in the quarter to identify them, to try and get them to closure to default those people who were not going to go forward. As a result, we took into income in the quarter. This is a little bit on the transparency side that I want to give you, a little bit in excess of $20 million of liquidated damages or non-returnable deposits. Wwe sought to offset that by taking a reserve on the pre-owned activity which you can see in the charts that we had published. We only have I think three or four aircraft in pre-owned and it is hard to attribute that to those aircraft and we have done it, but there is not an active market. So it is very hard to get comparables to say we can identify this with that, very hard to do but we have a fairly tidy reserve. We have also on the good news side Howard; we went into the last quarter having 22 inputs for the year 2009 into pre-owned. That is commitments on a fair market value basis to take airplanes in. As we work the backlog and as people have asked for various concessions, we in turn have extracted concessions. Those inputs for the year 2009 are now down to 12. So we are very pleased about that as we eliminate exposure in the pre-owned area. An area that is opaque to us right now, we can not tell how it is going to turn?
Howard Rubel - Jeffries & Company: You have all of a sudden got a.. -- I will call it a marketing headwind with everybody in Congress talking about business-jets being a bad and evil thing. What about the jobs that all of your workers do and all the productivity related to the airplane? How are the people at Gulfstream dealing with this?
Nick Chabraja: You might have noticed Howard that there was language in an early version of a House Bill suggesting that anyone who took TARP money would have to sell their aircraft. The Aerospace workers of the United States, one of our few manufacturing segments that got positive balance of trade wrote to their Congressman, and you did not see that in the Bill, it went quietly away. So we are trying to educate the country, the Congress, and the administration on the importance of this segment to the economy, where it is one of the few balance of trade positives that we have and is going very well. At Gulfstream itself, we are working very hard to take $40 million out of our cost structure, and that is not taking heads out of Savannah where we need them, where our production is going up. It is taking $30 million out of indirect, and another $10 million in our continuous improvement Lean Six Sigma process. So if we can get all of that, we have provided some further downside protection. So we are going to go right into the year and keep working that backlog, and we will see what happens. right now, we are cautiously optimistic.
Howard Rubel - Jeffries & Company: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Good morning, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: Good morning, Carter. How are you?
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: I am fantastic. Thank you for asking. I wondered if you could clarify a little bit more on the process of these defaults and the liquidated damages or uncollected deposits. How exactly that works? Presumably, someone move and then someone exercises a move-up privilege to take the airplane and then how does it, where does the deposit go and the airplane go and how does the collection of liquidated damages work? Any color there would be useful.
Nick Chabraja: Alright, I will help you but it is hard to generalize about a process that is unique to each individual contract. As people in the backlog indicate that they are having trouble, we try to ascertain whether it is a problem that we can work through with them, and get them to the place where they can take their aircraft, maybe in a different time span. If we conclude that we really cannot, and they are in default of their obligations under the contract, we send a cure notice as the law requires. If there is no response to the cure notice or if they are unable, and we do our down display outcome if we can, then we default them and we keep the non-returnable deposit. At that point we begin working on and if not sooner, looking at eligible buyers in the backlog who would like to move up and there are plenty and they have move-up provisions in their agreements. So in the quarter, we were able to replace, I think, all of the parties who defaulted and cover those positions.  As we go forward, Carter, with that process in mind, to the extent that more of these appear in 2009 and 2010 and if the economic circumstances continue, I would expect to get some. You will see lumpier earnings from Gulfstream because they may not be able to cover in every quarter because by the varying nature of these things you get some of them in the last month of the quarter. So I am expecting good annual performance but uneven, less predictable than it was this year, but we will watch that very carefully and try and alert you to it. I hope that addresses your question frankly.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: No, it does. I am just wondering, is there a concern at some point that you will not have a ready customer to move up for an airplane? It sounds like the answer to that is no.
Nick Chabraja : Well, look. You can always worry about that. I sure do not want to take it for granted but so far, folks have been willing to move up. They have been demanding their airplanes. They have been dissatisfied with where they were in the queue and we have also had circumstances where we have not defaulted people, but where they wanted concessions and we rearranged them in the queue.  We found someone to take their place and they in turn took the other person's place. These are all workouts and some of the customers need them and some of them do not at all. So we get, you are getting competing pressures here. Some very desperately want to move up and others would like some concessions and we are doing our best to be customer friendly while at the same time protecting Gulfstream and our shareholders' interest in the outcome. I should tell you that my view of the current backlog is that it is very strong.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: That is very helpful, Nick. Thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Co. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co: Yes, Nick, terrific quarter.
Nick Chabraja: Cai, they have more trouble with your name than they have with mine.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co: Could you give us some color on the business trends at Jet given the sharp decline in departures in the U.S of biz jets and also, what your 2009 numbers for Gulf Stream assume regarding additional trade-in losses, if any you think you might have to incur?
Nick Chabraja: Yes, Cai, I will take the last part first because it is the easiest. We do not have any assumptions with respect to that. We are calling it even-steven apart from the reserve we have. What we are working on hardest now is to reduce our exposure and we have done a pretty good job of that.  I think we will have some continuing success in doing that. So the fewer you have in inventory obviously the less risk you have there but it is a risk to us because the guidance I have given you assumes we do not experience further erosion.  On balance, Cai, I would say that the defense guidance I gave you is on the conservative side as it always is. Gulfstream, I think is a realistic cut at it. There may be more risk than opportunity. I have identified the opportunity but whatever shortfall we have there, I think first we can adjust to and be nimble about, but second, I expect defense to cover.  As Gulfstream has covered them in prior years, they stand ready to do what they would be asked to do if we have some trouble with Gulfstream. Jet aviation, you asked about that. It is really hard to tell from we did not have them two full months. The revenues are about what we expected. They are just shy of $200 million.  Here we have a currency exposure. The dollar had strengthened against the Swiss franc so it is a tad shy of what we expected but not as a result of operations, as a result of translation. We are booking this, obviously, very conservatively right now until we get our arms around it and understand what we have. The volume of completions and so forth is as we anticipated it. The issue here is not going to be volume; it is going to be getting our arms around operations and introducing operational excellence to a business that has a pretty good book of business. To the same effect, Cai, I am answering these questions fully because I want all the transparency I can get out there about this business. Our service business, the Gulfstream service centers and the General Dynamics services businesses grew from a volume point of view, 8% to 9% in the year. So we have a pretty good year despite the climate, and that was consistently through the fourth quarter. So far so good, and we will see how it goes with jet. The big piece of the puzzle is Gulfstream and I think we are holding on very well, it looks good to me for 2009; 2010 as well.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned- Sanford Bernstein: Good morning. I hate to continue on Gulfstream but I have got another question on it. When you talked about reducing the number of mid-sized deliveries in '09, if we went back six months ago, I mean this is a very different perspective. I know that in the past you have talked a lot about the greater resilience of the large-cabin backlog than the mid-sized. Could you describe over that time, the characteristics of the customers and nature of the discussions you have had? How have they differed between the mid-size customers and the large-cabin, which you clearly see as a strong situation?
Nick Chabraja: Doug, I am not sure I can parse that for you. You have to be mindful of the fact that those discussions are being conducted at about five management levels, six removed from me. In the second half, the demand for mid-size began to erode much faster than the order intake on the large-cabin aircraft did. Then when we got to, I think about mid-November, and we had a real ongoing crisis with respect to bank financing, the order activity there got very quiet and we had shorter backlogs in that area than we did for the large-cabin. So we did what was prudent. We talked to our major supplier, IAI, and began to adjust rates and we have adjusted them several times. We have got it down to a number that we think is manageable and doable, give or take a few. I do not know that I can characterize all of the discussions or divide customers by type, and I do not even think that would be fair to them, for me to undertake that.
Doug Harned- Sanford Bernstein: What I am getting at is, what is made you comfortable that the large-cabin situation is different given that it is clearly changed quite a bit on the mid-sized from what you all thought six months back?
Nick Chabraja: Yes, I think while the order activity slowed in the third and fourth quarter, we continued to get orders at a greater rate than we do in the mid-size. The backlog is significantly larger and we were having fewer problems in that backlog with respect to those clients. So I think all in all, it is not difficult to come to the conclusion that we can do better in the large-cabin aircraft and that we will do better. We are not doing something here that is defying the gravity, we are stepping up production consistent with our prior plan because the backlog and the orders received even in the second half supports that production rate. If conditions developed as a result of further deterioration in the American economy, and internationally because this is a global issue right now, we would change that production rate and we have the ability to reset it quarterly, and we do what we needed to do. Right now, I am giving you the cleanest outlook I can give you, and it is unrelated to gloom and doom, it is unrelated to data, other than the internal data here and our view of the strength from the backlog. Should that backlog deteriorate, you will hear about it from us and we will change our production.
Doug Harned- Sanford Bernstein: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed Sir.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Company: Thanks, good morning. Good quarter. Nick I was hoping you could give us some color maybe on succession planning with respect to Jay coming in the June timeframe and what is he specifically working on to get him up to speed and also how you think that the transition will happen and some mechanics involved.
Nick Chabraja: Yes. Before the time Jay takes over, he will had nine months with us. The first three of those months I would say in general, he spent working with staff, my staff, the Senior Vice Presidents and those who report to them understanding fully the headquarters' function and its purpose in how it would support him and how it supports me currently and how he might shift that to suit his own management styles and ability.  Since then, we have changed his focus over into operations and he is been working with the Executive Vice Presidents on operating issues, but even in the first three months, he spent a lot of time with me at Gulfstream getting deep into their issues.  On a weekly basis, for example, Joe Lombardo and Larry Flynn, Senior Vice President of sales at Gulfstream and Dan Cleary, the Chief Financial Officer have a meeting with me either by telephone or in person that Jay attends and we go through every contract in backlog where these people are and what is changed since the week before and who is saying what about what and what can we do to help them.  So he is keenly familiar with the Gulfstream situation and will know how to handle all of that. He understands the business model and I think by the time I collect my pension check and walk out the door, Jay is ready to go and we have an extreme amount of confidence about it; and by the way, we are not, in my defense, I am not leaving a company in disarray. This is a powerful, well oiled machine and it will continue to be so and the succession is appropriate and Jay will be supported by very senior, very experienced Senior Vice Presidents, staff officers and group executives who have been in their position for long periods of time and really outstanding business as Presidents. So I could not think of a company that is better to turn over to a new leader.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Company: Alright, that sounds good getting into the follow-up. So the timeline still is pretty much unchanged and you still are looking to stay on for the similar amount as non-executive Chairman?  
Nick Chabraja: I will stay as a non-executive Chairman. My duties will be a little broader maybe than typical non-executive Chairman. Not only will worry about the interface with the Board but I will be here to give Jay some help with respect to capital deployment, will be my principal activity.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Company: Alright, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Macquarie.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie: Good afternoon.
Nick Chabraja: Good afternoon, Rob.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie: Just quickly on the defense budget side. There still remains, I would say an element of uncertainty about what the new administration is going to do with regard to Defense spending. What is your latest thinking on what the plan is going to be and if any of your programs could be at risk?
Nick Chabraja: Rob we are going to get a quick take on that. So the administration says some time in February, but they will not deliver a budget till probably April. I can not imagine based on the rumblings I have heard or the situation in the economy that they are going to be looking to cut in production programs. It is just inconceivable to me.  The stimulus leverage for manufacturing is greater than anything throughout the economy. So I just can not imagine when they are out looking for stimulus and put fresh money into things that are stimulus that they would take away from existing production programs, that is beyond what was in the budget that they inherited. So we are feeling very comfortable about our programs, but we will have to wait and see.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Good afternoon, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: Good afternoon, Rob.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Another non-aerospace question, if I may.
Nick Chabraja: You may.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Ship building, not planes, but we will talk about ships. Could you talk a little bit about the DDG-1000 and the idea of two ships with a trade off of DDG-51's to the other guy. Also a comment perhaps on your commercial ships program, the health of the customer and the delivery schedule there?
Nick Chabraja: Commercial ships we are doing spectacularly. The first ship went to sea, for first-of-class, it went to sea in January, a little bit ahead of contract delivery schedule. For first-of-class it was damn near perfect, within budget. We recorded profit on it. Second ship is 80% complete. The customer loves the ships. The issue for us is to sell the slots six through nine. The existing customer has the right to those slots right now. We have plenty of remarketing opportunities there, but we have to await their decision which is to be forthcoming soon. If they take them, they can have them and if they do not, we will move on with those ships, but it is a great program for us. DDG-1000, I do not really have much to say on that subject. We have got a contract for the first boat. Northrup has a contract for the second boat. The third boat is 50% funded by the Congress. I think the Department of Navy is searching for ways in which they can most efficiently produce those three boats. I do not want to engage in any speculation about who might do what to whom on this. At the end of the day for us, this is in the noise there. It is not going to have a material impact on our plan.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Okay. Going back to the commercial ships, those slots six through nine, what is the timing on those?
Nick Chabraja: They become available if US ship does not exercise their option, they become available in the spring. There are ships for delivery in the out years, let's see if I can tell you, I do not even have the schedule.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Is it far enough out?
Nick Chabraja: It is far enough out but that is not a problem for us. It is not in our current planning horizon. They would be probably 2012 delivery ships or the first of them would be.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks very much, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: We are delivering about one every nine months; it is what you are going to see so you can figure it out yourself.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS, please proceed.
David Strauss - UBS: Good morning, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: Good morning, David.
David Strauss - UBS: The book-to-bill at Gulfstream on new airplanes, can you just give us a sense of who exactly in this environment is buying airplanes, maybe geographically and customer type?
Nick Chabraja: No, I am not going to do that. David, it is fairly diverse as it has always been. Tthe backlog for the year was 52% international, 48% North American, about the same as usual. There were folks who could make the deposit and sign the contract in good conscience and we were pleased with it.
David Strauss - UBS: On pricing, how are you addressing pricing on new aircraft given that there are on the large-cabin side? A fair amount of relatively new used aircrafts out there, I think prices are probably 20%, 25% lower than what a new airplane has been priced at.
Nick Chabraja: David, I do not know how you get your pricing information. If you have a transaction that actually occurred, let me know about it. Our pricing on new aircraft continues to hold strong, we are getting price increases. That is not true by the way of the mid-cabin, the mid-size aircraft. There is a softening of the price point. With respect to new aircraft, there still remains a backlog that we cannot satisfy fast enough. Now there will be people who really do not want the aircraft, and they will put it on the market in an effort to get the relief out in the marketplace. I have not seen those transactions close, and you are [ipsy-dipsy] it, that they are at lower prices, materially lower, none of that evidence has crossed my desk.
David Strauss - UBS: Okay. I was just referring to listed prices. I agree there have not been main transactions but those are the count list.
Nick Chabraja: Gulfstream is listing them high. They are trying to make money on the flip. I do not see that they are getting it, but I do not see any relief frankly for those in the back of the queue who would like to move up and get it cheap, otherwise they would be doing it. I think they dream about it, and I think some of you stimulate that discussion, but I have not seen it happening.
David Strauss - UBS: Okay. Thanks Nick.
Amy Gilliland: I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Securities. Please proceed Sir.
Ron Epstein - Bank of America Securities: Good morning, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: Good morning, Ron.
Ron Epstein - Bank of America Securities: Just wanted to again walk away from Aerospace for a minute, why do not we talk about some of the defense stuff. As we look into 2009, what are some of the programs on the horizon that we should keep an eye on; it could be opportunities for you in the upcoming year?
Nick Chabraja : I think there is lot of them. Take a look at MRAP Light or MRAP ATV I think is the appropriate initials that would present a lot of upside to us, watch the re-initiation of the Czech program which is upside to us in our plan both as the cash and earnings. Keep an eye on the Saudi program which is in some respects baked into our plan but provides some opportunity as well because there are many segments to that.  Let me point you another one where we tend to ignore it for planning purposes because it is a little hard to put your finger on, all things for Iraq, for the government of Iraq, some of which now before our Congress. We have not included that in our plan because we just can not get our arms around it. So I mean, I could go on like that for quite some time.  I think the point is when I say in my guidance to you has been conservative, is that we have more opportunity than risk I think, on the defense side. Will all of those opportunities materialize? Probably not, but I think they are stronger than the downside, so we think that that guidance is okay. It is reliable guidance, but sure, you put your finger on it there is a lot of upside.  Somebody was asking me about the DDG-1000. We will not get into any deals on that unless we think there is upside in them for us.
Ron Epstein - Bank of America Securities: Sure, sure. Now, this maybe one follow on to Rob's question on the commercial ships. How is the execution going on that now with the JV?
Nick Chabraja : Perfect. Absolutely flat out perfect. It could not be better. We are beating our budgets right from the get go, right from the first ship. We have never had a first in class that performed as well as DC1 never ever in any program. So its been absolutely mind-blowing.
Ron Epstein - Bank of America Securities: Super. Thanks.
Operator: This ends the Q&A session at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Amy Gilliland for closing remarks.
Amy Gilliland: Just want to thank everyone for joining the call today. If you have additional questions I can be reached at 703-876-3748. Thanks and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the third quarter 2008 General Dynamics earnings conference call. My name is Shaqwana and I will be the coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards end of this conference. (Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma’am.
Amy Gilliland:  Thank you, Shaqwana and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter conference call. I want to remind listeners that as always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimates regarding the company’s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s 10-K and 10-Q filing. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Chabraja.
Nick Chabraja:  Thanks, Amy. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. This review of our third quarter performance takes place in what has been and continues to be a tumultuous period in the markets and dislocation in the financial services sector in particular. As a result, some of you on the call have changed name plates, have new employers, and a few of our regulars and friends on these calls are no longer participating. Accordingly, I want to wish you all well in the time ahead as we go forward. Our result is pretty straightforward. Main [ph] quarter, General Dynamics had a really strong performance in the third quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2007, sales increased 4.5% to slightly over $7.1 billion. Operating earnings increased 16.5% to $933 million with operating margins of 13.1%, a recent high. I thought that was an all time high, but we did a little research and we found that we’ve done slightly better back in 2001 in one quarter, but nevertheless, a great result. Earnings per share this quarter were $1.59, up 18.7% year-over-year and significantly better than consensus. This quarter, we generated almost $750 million in free cash, approximately 118% of net income. Importantly, we have cash and available securities of over $2.8 billion. It's a great time to have cash and a strong balance sheet. This quarter’s performance builds on the strength of the prior two quarters this year. Year-to-date sales have increased 8.7%, operating earnings have increased 21.1%, and earnings per share have increased 25.3% when compared to the first three quarters of 2007. Let me spend the next couple of minutes giving you some perspective on our operating performance focusing first on the defense segment and then concluding with aerospace and maybe making some forward-looking statements particularly with respect to the last quarter of this year and some of the implications for next year as well. Let me start with Combat Systems which performed very well in the quarter. The businesses in this group had great margin performance, each and every one of them. Margins increased to 14.2%, that's 200 basis points better than a year ago on the strength of improved productivity across almost all of our major programs. The result of this productivity was a 14.9% increase in operating earnings even though sales volume is essentially flat against the same quarter last year. However, year-to-date sales have increased 13.8%, and operating earnings have increased 35.4% over the same period in 2007. In the fourth quarter, I think sales volume will be up significantly over this quarter. But margins should be back in the 12%, 12% plus range. For the year, sales growth will not be as high as I have previously forecasted. I have been talking to you about 9% to 10%. But margins will be significantly higher than the 12.9% to 13% that I have previously forecasted. So, in the final analysis, I think Combat Systems EBIT will be about as we had forecast. From an orders perspective, Combat Systems had a great quarter, adding almost $2 billion to both funded and total backlog leaving them well positioned for next year's anticipated growth with a backlog of $15.8 billion. As for Marine Systems, really strong quarter. They had 12% growth in sales against third quarter of '07 and a 10% operating margin, 120 basis points better than a year ago. A combination of sales growth and improved margins produced a 27.3% growth in Marine Systems operating earnings. We had booking rate increases in the quarter on the Virginia Class T-AKE and commercial product carrier programs as a result of productivity gains in electric boat and NASSCO. Year-to-date sales have risen 10.6% and earnings have increased 21.6% over the same period in 2007. While I am celebrating the 10% operating margin, I want to warn you a little bit that it won't be repeated in the fourth quarter but margins will be well north of 9%. For the year, we will have sales growth crowding 8% and operating margins nicely above of 9%. Marine Systems is the only operating group where the backlog is down somewhat in the quarter, but don't be misled. Look for a large backlog increase in the fourth quarter or at the latest, first quarter of next year as we contract for Virginia Class Block III. This will provide significant backlog growth and the sales volume growth we talked to you about over our planning horizon. Moving on to Information Systems and Technology, sales increased 4.7% on mostly organic growth and earnings increased 6.3%. Margins were 10 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2007. Year-to-date sales have increased 3.5% and earnings 6.3% with margins 30 basis points higher than the same period in 2007. The growth in sales of this quarter, although still modest, represents an acceleration in growth rate which I expect to continue through the end of the year. I should caution you that margins are likely to fall in the fourth quarter as a result of mix shift towards more services work. Backlog importantly increased by $600 million making this quarter the fifth consecutive quarter in which Information Systems and Technology backlog increased and orders were well in excess of deliveries. Finally, we move to Aerospace. Gulfstream also had a terrific quarter, pretty much all the way around with sales growth of 4.3% and operating earnings growth of 24.3%. Driven by an operating margin of 20.5%, 330 basis points better than the same quarter a year ago. This result was achieved really underpinned by three things; first was favorable pricing in the backlog; second, a very favorable product mix in the quarter; and third, significant manufacturing and completions cost improvement. With respect to mix, let's see if I can ground you a little bit, compared to second quarter of this year of '08, we had one more large aircraft and it happened to be a special mission aircraft with higher margins, and we had one less medium-sized aircraft and we had no 500s or 350s, all contributing to almost a perfect mix in the quarter. The internal improvement that I mentioned, the manufacturing completions throughout improvement effectively offset supply chain cost increases that we incurred in the quarter leaving the favorable pricing in the backlog fall to profit. Year-to-date sales have increased 10% earnings at 26.6% and margins up 250 basis points over the first three quarters of 2007. It was a good quarter from an orders perspective as well, maybe surprising in light of the markets and the length of our existing backlog. The book-to-bill of 3.87 expressed in dollars was driven by large aircraft orders and the new 650 order intake. A soft spot in that result is a slowing of order intake in the mid-sized aircraft. But overall, the backlog increased $3.3 billion during the quarter. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, I think you will see increased sales volume in the fourth quarter but lower margins as a result of the less advantageous mix than we experienced in this quarter. I have given you some information about the fourth quarter in each of the groups and in some cases the year for each but perhaps not enough for you to pinpoint our expectations for the full year. I had previously given you guidance of $6 to $6.05. Let me conclude by increasing our guidance to $6.10 without a range. It's not unreasonable to add or subtract a couple of pennies to that number and create a range of $6.08 to $6.12, but I think we are looking at $6.10. As for the future, General Dynamics backlog grew by $5.2 billion this quarter. Funded backlog now stands $50 billion, total backlog at $60, and total estimated contract value approaching $80 billion. This backlog, the productivity of our businesses, and a powerful balance sheet leaves us in great shape to enhance value for our shareholders going forward. If you like steady earnings and efficient conversion of earnings into cash, GD has got to be a good place to be. Hugh, you have something that you would like to add?
Hugh Redd:  Yes. Thank you, Nick. Good morning. Following on with Nick’s comments regarding the strong balance sheet and cash generation during the quarter, our ability to generate cash resulted in a strong balance sheet which is improving each quarter. This is manifest in the financial metrics we provided in Exhibit G to the press release, metrics like return on invested capital, debt to equity, and debt to capital. These metrics are strong in absolute numbers and have improved significantly year-over-year. The condition of our balance sheet ensures continued access to adequate and sufficient short-term and long-term debt markets. During the quarter, net interest expense was modestly lower than either the second quarter of 2008 or the third quarter of 2007. At the end of the quarter, cash and marketable securities exceeded debt by $665 million. For your information, marketable securities were less than $200 million. They are carried at market values which are currently at or above original cost. In September, we retired $150 million of the senior notes upon their scheduled maturity. Year-to-date, we've retired $650 million of the previously designated long-term debt. In addition to retiring debt, we repurchased 6.1 million shares during the quarter at a cost of $500 million. Year-to-date through the end of the third quarter, we have repurchased 14.4 million shares and we continue to accumulate shares in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.2%, for the nine months ended 30.9%. With the extension of the R&D tax credit, we now expect the effective tax rate to be slightly above 31% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Those expectations are lower than our prior expectations. So, again, just slightly above 31%. Amy, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it over to you.
Amy Gilliland:  Thank you, Hugh. Before we move to the question and answer period, I want to remind to ask only one question and one follow-on question so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Shaqwana, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Operator:  (Operator instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  Yes. Hi. Good morning, Nick and Hugh. The results of the marine business were outstanding. I was wondering if you could give us some more color. Was there any one-time things that happened? How's also the Daewoo JV going?
Nick Chabraja:  Okay, thanks Ron. This was pretty straightforward. The margin gain was propelled by the pre-booking rate changes that I have identified for you and on a prospective basis, they will continue to help marine group performance. There was one, to my memory, sort of contract close out the last of the SSG Edward that added about $6 million in both revenue and earnings. That's like they won't repeat itself. However, you never know quarter-to-quarter what other things will appear but it's what led me to say I don't believe that the ten will be repeated, but I like – we are averaging year-to-date about 93 in marine and I think the fourth quarter result will be at least that good. So we'll finish the year in my view at 93 or slightly better if we get a better fourth quarter run. So I am greatly encouraged and it's been a remarkable turnaround. I give a lot credit to Mike Toner and the presidents of the three shipyards. They've got this thing going pretty well right now and it's only going to get better. The relationship with our partners in Korea is working very, very well and you may have noticed that I included the commercial product carrier in the booking rate increase. That ship has been launched. It will be delivered to the customer in January. It should go to sea before the end of the year for test. And I'd say it's the best first of a kind we've ever had where we didn't experience a first in class sorts of pale up and pull up as we built the ship. It pretty much went in accordance with budget and got slightly below, and we are experiencing significant learning on the second boat, so the relationship is very good. The design we got proved very adaptable to our shipyard and our manufacturing methods, and we couldn't be more pleased.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  Great. And then just one quick follow-on, if I may. In terms of the demand you are seeing for aircraft at Gulfstream, have you seen any impact yet from what's going on in the financial market?
Nick Chabraja:  Sure, Ron. What we have is a lot of interest in the product, a good pipeline. But the absence of credit and the turmoil in the credit markets really kind of seized up demand and I expect that to be the case until the credit markets re-emerge and I expect that here in short order. We are beginning see some signs now of markets beginning to restructure themselves and come looking for customers again. I've had bankers talk to me about willingness to provide aircraft financing to our customers. I would say that probably prices for that financing are higher and credit quality is a very important ingredient, but I'm beginning to see signs of this market restructuring itself a little bit. We'll have to watch this in the fourth quarter particularly with risk. It's more important for us with respect to our mid-sized aircraft. It's not as important for the large aircraft for two reasons; the length of our backlog and the fact that many of these large aircraft aren't financed. The larger customers aren't financing purchase of that size. So, sure, we've seen an impact. We're not free from impact of what has been so dramatic. It came upon us really rather suddenly.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  Great. Thank you, Nick.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen and Company:  Thank you Nick. Great quarter. You had a spectacular book-to-bill at Gulfstream. If we extracted the G650, would the book-to-bill had been overrun? And secondly, given that those customers presumably made their down payment required for firm orders, how come the advances were down and not up in the quarter sequentially from the second quarter?
Nick Chabraja:  Let me have that second part again, Cai.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen and Company:  The second part is that clearly you got a lot of G650 orders and it looks to us like about 60 or so, maybe more. How come with the advances associated with those firm orders, your total advances were down from the second quarter?
Nick Chabraja:  I don't know. I don't know with respect to the second and I'm not even accepting your statement because I don't think you would have the information that led you to calculate that.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen and Company:  I'm just talking corporate wise.
Nick Chabraja:  I have no idea. We were working off advance payments all over the corporation. I have no idea. Cai, with respect to your first question, I don't know how much granularity I intend to provide because we don't provide units of sale until the end of the year and then we do it in groups. What I think I'm going to do for you at the end of the year is separate out the G650 so we'll report jumbo, large, and medium to give you all some insight. The one thing I will tell you is we were clearly below 1 to 1 book-to-bill on the midsize. But I think while I haven't done the calculation, I think that the big guys were pretty close. We were particularly strong on the 550 and I think it was over 1 to 1 book-to-bill but I don't know for sure because I'm not trying to do that calculation. It's not an information I intend to furnish. We're not going to parse this thing, but it's quite an awful lot of airplanes.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen and Company:  And the follow on, given the slowdown in the biz jet market, when do you expect to close the Jet Aviation acquisition and how are your – I guess you would have expected it to be accretive, do you still think it can be accretive in 2009 after you close given what we see in the market today?
Nick Chabraja:  Yes, why not? Got a staggering backlog. As I've said to you before, their problem with revenue isn't going to find the business, it's creating the efficiency to run it through the mill. We fully expect it to be accretive. Do I expect the services revenue to be as high as we might otherwise have thought from the maintenance repair facility? Probably not. The same might be true for FBO gas station sales but the big bellwether in this business almost 50% of it is completions work, and if we can turn up the wick on that, it might be 55% or 60%. But to give you a little insight into MRO, our service business is up in the quarter. I was down there visiting. They were running at 120% capacity, but they expect to drop down to100%. It seemed like a low but it's not like this thing has gone cold. We're experiencing very nice revenue from services. And I would expect flight hours to go back up as the price of jet fuel comes down. I think it particularly impacted medium and light sizes to be more sensitive to operating cost. I think you will see some of that. So there is no gloom and doom here on that size. When we will close it was one of your question? When the justice department gets done with their Hart-Scott-Rodino review and gives us clearance, that's when we'll do it. We're hopeful that that happens before the end of this year.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen and Company:  Excellent. Thanks and great quarter again.
Nick Chabraja:  Thanks, Cai.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JP Morgan. Please proceed.
Joe Nadol – JP Morgan:  Thanks, good morning.
Nick Chabraja:  Good morning, Joe.
Joe Nadol – JP Morgan:  Nick, just to – you mentioned in combat that you think that sales growth is going to be a little bit lighter than you thought three months ago but that margins would be higher. I'm just wondering if you could give us more color on the changes in the outlook.
Nick Chabraja:  Yes. I'd be happy to, Joe. I think the answer to that is the same if you would have asked me why lower this quarter than the third quarter '07. I'd give you the same answer. Here is what I think we've experienced. This might surprise you. We have a modest increase over the third quarter of '07 in armored combat vehicles, almost up across the board. Land systems is up. We are down at ATP where we had lower than expected Chameleon deliveries and we were down slightly at OTS on significantly less aircraft tactical munitions business. In addition to that, for the year, we don't believe we are going to get the check revenue booked for the year and the cash collected. It's possible but we think that's slipping into the first quarter. The relationship there is markedly improved. The vehicles are undergoing tests at the Army. They have passed tests that what would be our OSD level and we are working on the re-negotiation of a contract for a full complement of vehicles. But those are the things that really drive the shortfall in revenue and the improvement in productivity has made up for it at the earnings line. I think that's probably the best answer to your question.
Joe Nadol – JP Morgan:  Okay. It sounds like mix might have improved given what the strong and what is weaker. Is that – ?
Nick Chabraja:  You are getting – and that's why I made the point that the armored vehicle line has continued to do well. It might surprise you if you think back, Joe, in the third quarter of '07 we had a major pick up of MRAP vehicles. MRAP volume is flat. So we did very well with MRAP in the third quarter. So the down draft didn't occur there in the combat vehicle side. It occurred really in one segment of munitions and maybe a little bit of second one. There is a little less Hydra-70 volume if you really want to get down in the (inaudible). But it's Chameleon deliveries weren't what we had in plan.
Joe Nadol – JP Morgan:  Okay, and then secondly Nick, I know it's early days here on the 250, but any color on market feedback or early interest, that sort of thing?
Nick Chabraja:  Yes, I think the plane is being well received. We have a considerable number of LOIs, the last time I checked and I'm confident that some of those will be very soon converted into orders. We go through a process where we execute letters of intent first and then hammer up the contract details, but the plane has been well received by the community and we are seeing a lot of interest from our 550 and 450 customers who are coming to us to fill out their fleets with a couple of 250s. So I think we've hit that right where the market needed that plane. I think we've got it right and I'm pleased with it.
Joe Nadol – JP Morgan:  Okay. Thanks Nick.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Good morning Nick. Question on Gulfstream. We're trying to understand how firm is firm for the 2009 Gulfstream deliveries and we've seen this trend of upwards about 60% of new orders coming from international. Can you flesh out for us, what gives you confidence that these customers are going to stay entrenched especially in view of the dollar weakness and rising inventories and likely next couple of quarters decline in prices because then they can get – they do need the planes, they can get them sooner and maybe pay less?
Nick Chabraja:  I don't know about that. I can't support any of that hypothesis you have just advanced, particularly towards the end. Heidi, we have taken a good look at the 2009 backlog. We've scrubbed it. We think of pretty solid credits across the board. We are not getting much in the way of discussion from our customer base. I feel particularly strongly about the 450 and the 550 backlog. The international component of the 2009 delivery is not as strong as the international component of the 2008 orders I also have a very large backlog and it is very easy to pull people forward if we have to, but we are not anticipating that. We have heard you and others on this subject your worries and we are all over it. And we do not see anything out there other than what is typical. I mean, now and then you get somebody who has got an issue and you work it out as best you can. The other thing that gives us comfort is the contract terms and conditions we put in place after the last cyclical downturn and the amount of cash that we have – that we are holding as these claims go through our system. So it is not very irrational to default. Occasionally people have to default for very irrational reasons, but right now, we are feeling very comfortable about it all. If you want to worry a little bit about Gulfstream, let me get you into the right pen here, I think where we have some softness is in the midsize aircraft and particularly in the 150 models where we do not have as large a backlog. And if that continues during the course of the fourth quarter, we will cut production on those aircraft. They represent a little bit over 10% of our operating earnings at Gulfstream and we have plans in place to mitigate that. Those plans include bringing forward production of additional large aircraft and we have been spending the last half of the year working production planning issues in our supply base to enable us to do that, if we must. So my feeling about Gulfstream is I will be shocked if next year they drop below $1 billion of EBIT. The issue for me is how much can we grow them in this market condition, but I do not expect a problem. I do not expect it on the pre-owned side either where we experienced so much trouble in the last downturn. I hope that covers your question.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Thanks, that does flush it out. Would you be willing to give us color on the percentage of international in ’09 and –
Nick Chabraja: I do not know. I would be willing but I do not know the answer. I would have to go and tally that up in the backlog. We gather that data for you all. It is not something that is as important to us as it is to you, and we do have our order basis but we do not track it through the backlog but we can do it.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Well we see that the brick trade is over, so many of us are wondering what the implications are then for your backlog.
Nick Chabraja: Yes, but I do not see it being over. I mean, I do not have Russians running up to cancel. You have made up your mind that everybody in that group is broke and I do not think it is true. I think, they are pulling back their horns but I think they are honoring their commitments, at least to us. We deliver planes to those folks and they write checks and they make their payments like everybody else does. I am much more concerned about the financial sector in the United States than I do about some of my international customers, but –
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Alright then –
Nick Chabraja: I cannot speculate about conditions in the world or even in the domestic economy, it is going to be what it is – but I have an enormous confidence in our ability to manage through our 2009 backlog in 2010 for that matter.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  My follow-up question Nick then would be, can you bring us up to speed on your views of cash deployment versus stock repurchase? We have seen a drop down in a lot of properties out there. Are we going to see a higher appetite for M&A potentially in’09 as a result?
Nick Chabraja: I think, Heidi, I have a balanced view of that. General Dynamics’ stock is increasingly attractive to us and as you pointed out, we had bought 14.4 million shares in the first three quarters and we have kept it up and I think when we stopped for our blackout period, we had a running tally of 16.1 million shares in the year. And it is handsomely accretive for us. Will we look at deals? Sure, we will. But they are going to have to do a good job for us and then there is the issue that we do not have to confront right at the moment, for deals of any size, that is, what will the debt markets be when they reestablish themselves. Right now, we can take care of our requirements for jet aviation and anything else we would like to buy including our own stocks out of cash and access to the commercial paper market, which we have full and unfettered access to. But if you’re talking about doing a significant acquisition, I don’t know what the markets are like out there, in fact I’m not seeing any transactions that are significantly financed but that will all take shape, I think, in the fourth quarter one way or another. We don’t know how to price that, we don’t know right now long-term debts. Appetites will have change, I think, during the course of the quarter depending on the facts on the ground.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks very much, Nick.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks, good morning and a really good quarter, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: Thanks, Myles.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co: A question for you again on Gulfstream, sorry to beat this one up, but with respect to pre-owned inventory as well as trade-in commitments, which were two areas you were burned by in the last down cycle, can you tell us what is the current pre-owned inventory and also has the trade-in commitments risen from $70 million at the end of the year?
Nick Chabraja: We have one aircraft in inventory that we took in, a G4 SP, in September and we have two kinds of commitments, Myles. Most of our trade clauses are fair market value that is established 120 days I believe in advance of the trade date. We have a very elaborate process by which we establish that. We have a commitment on two aircraft that is of the old kind that we no longer make that is a guaranteed value trade and there aren’t anymore. And as a matter of fact, with respect to new orders, we have quit taking trade commitments of any kind but we hope to relax that soon as we view what is going on out in the world. But we are in dramatically better shape than we were the last time we went into a cyclical downturn because of both the absence of inventory and absence of commitments of an inappropriate kind. So, so far so good on the pre-owned front, not been a bother yet.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Given the ground inventories are rising and the transactions are going down, do you anticipate more – getting more put pre-owned as opposed to – when it was obviously a good market with transactions, no one really wanted to put it you because they could get their price.
Nick Chabraja: Oh, I think that depends on the price we establish. People are going to have to play the same game. We will take into consideration as we establish a fair market value, the direction of the market.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks.
Nick Chabraja: We will discount accordingly. We won't –the price won't be the last comparable trade, right, it will be the last comparable trade discounted if the market is moving in a negative direction. So I think people will place their bets just like they do now, predicate it on the direction they think the market is moving.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, thanks, Nick.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs: Good morning.
Nick Chabraja: Good morning, Richard.
Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs: Switching topics, I saw your JLTV on at the AUSA show and I want to know if it is possible to get your view on how you see that program panning out. There seem to be a potential for an interim solution with MRAP Light and possibly the AM General ECV II, so just want to know if I get your thoughts there.
Nick Chabraja: I think JLTV is a program fully supported by the Armed Forces. It is an objective vehicle, which means it is a development program. I think the Army has announced that they intend to make three awards to our competitors in this quarter or systems design development contract and after that, to have a down select and a further development, so it will be a while before they are fielding JLTV and they have interim requirements which you are seeing on news about. But as best I know, MRAP Light or other interim solutions with different names are neither funded nor programs record, so I do not know how to speculate those for you although I remain terribly interested into all of that. But I think you will see JLTV go forward probably in the quarter, at least that's what the Army is predicting, but if it slips it'll be into the first quarter of next year. I think they've got their funding for this phase of the program and it will be the objective vehicle and it will create a very sizeable buy over time in a market that's ancillary to and adjacent to what we occupy with the big combat vehicles. But we love to move into adjacencies and we like our partner very, very much who participates regularly in this market segment and has terrific reputation. So I'm very interested in that program. Okay?
Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs: Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Good afternoon, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: Afternoon, Rob. How are you?
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Good, thanks. To what extent can you give us some sense of what next year looks like across the businesses?
Nick Chabraja: Well, I don't want to go any further than I already did in my remarks. We've got a ton of backlog. We are going to do okay. We're going to grow the business. We're going go – as we do every year, we're going to go through our planning cycle right now. Our businesses are hard at it right now and they will be in the first week in November and then I will be at Gulfstream the second week in November, and we'll have a plan then that's solid and something I can talk about. And I will talk to you about it given my first opportunity which usually isn't until the fourth quarter conference call in the middle of January. But sometimes, some years, there has been an investors' conference or some other vehicle that enables me to get out and give specific guidance. But look, I think we've got plenty of business, plenty of backlog. I think we're going to see very strong combat systems growth. I've been talking about 10% publicly. I don't see any reason that that won't be true. I think we are going to see some IS&T growth. We've been building for it. Our marine group will continue to grow. Gulfstream, we never planned a lot of growth in our out year plans for '09 and '10. We talked to you about a spurt Gulfstream growth in 2011. That will in fact occur as we begin making deliveries of the 250 and the 650 Green deliveries.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Well, that's actually pretty helpful, Nick. But qualitatively, I might ask, is there an area that you find more vulnerable? I'm not talking about Gulfstream but the three military-oriented businesses. As we go into a new administration, are there particular areas that you think hold up better than others?
Nick Chabraja: Rob, I don't think so. I think, look, I think ship building is on a course that's not to be changed. Though you're going to have a Democratic Congress no matter which party occupies Pennsylvania Avenue, and that Congress is dead set on improving the numbers of ships in the fleet and I think our submarine program is pretty much locked and loaded. It's just a question of time. Performance on that program has been absolutely superlative and I'm proud of Electric Boat. For that matter, I'm proud of our partners at Northrop-Grumman, Newport News; done a good job. We are doing great at NASSCO. There is demand for auxiliary ships; they are being built now, very successful T-AKE program and there'll be follow-ons for that kind of ships. The vagueness in ship building is on the surface combatant side where we have some exposure, but I expect they'll build something. It's either going to be DDG-51s or DDG-1000s. We'll have some grist for the mill there. I think there is a pent up demand for information systems and technology boat products, network products, and services as evidenced by our growing backlog over five quarters now. And George Shapiro, who unfortunately isn't with us here, has made a career out of chiding me about absence of organic growth in IS&T. So you're well aware of the history of that but we've suffered a flat spot for a couple of years there that is now obviously providing us organic growth and it's accelerating. So I feel pretty good across the board here and I think it's not going to matter to me too much which party is in the White House. I think our programs are strong and that backlog is durable and we are in good shape I think. What we tell our people internally is perform, perform, perform. Every administration likes programs that are on cost and on schedule. The ones that are vulnerable are the ones that are (inaudible). But we try real, real hard to back up our customer here and make the services look good by having programs that are coming in on budget. When we don't, we get real unhappy about it. But good margins for us usually indicate good performance for the benefit of the customer.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse:  Well, you definitely showed that this quarter. Thanks very much, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: Thanks, Rob.
Amy Gilliland:  Shaqwana, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Harry Nourse with Banc of America. Please proceed.
Harry Nourse – Banc of America:  Good afternoon.
Nick Chabraja:  Harry, how are you?
Harry Nourse – Banc of America:  Not bad, thank you. I was wondering, Nick, whether you could just talk about the international component of combat and how are bookings from a broad side in the quarter?
Nick Chabraja:  I don't know specifically bookings, Harry, but they had nice performance in the quarter. Their margins improved slightly and the volume improved very slightly. They have a considerable backlog and there are a number of additional opportunities. Some of them sole source and some of them competition. And I know that offline Amy can give you a lot of help in understanding that. That is a nicely growing business for us. We've been a little bit preoccupied with getting the check issue resolved. We probably spend an awful lot of time on FRES which is still, I think, up in the air as to the nature and shape of that program and how we fit into it. But the opportunity set for European land systems is very good, both their backlog and their future.
Harry Nourse – Banc of America:  And how is the Saudi contract advancing?
Nick Chabraja:  Moving right along, I think we'll have a contract in place this year for – or early 2009, I'm not sure which either this quarter or next for 724 vehicles for the Saudi Arabian National Guards. And we are also working on an unrelated contract but also for labs [ph] with the army for their land forces and that probably will be later in 2009. We also expect a tank contract. The award for the engineering effort for the M1A2S, that’s the Saudi version, will be less [ph] this year probably in the fourth quarter. Certainly in the fourth quarter if it’s going to be this year. But I think that should get done before the end of the year. And then we’ll follow on with the production contract itself. So all those things are moving slowly but surely into the right place.
Harry Nourse – Banc of America:  Thanks very much.
Amy Gilliland:  I want to thank you for joining the call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3748. Have a great day.
Operator:  Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a good day.

Nicholas Chabraja: We're doing well on the program, and we're getting, ready, obviously, for increased volume there, which will, I think, help efficiency, so we're doing well on that program. Bath, you know, I don't quite know what to say. We've got late-breaking news not officially confirmed to me, but I believe what I'm reading in the press reports about the Navy's posture with respect to the program of record, the DDG 1000, and stopping that build at two and building instead more DDG 51s. You know and I don't know how that will play out. This morning I had to look at a piece that you wrote, and your view or speculation would be about mine at this point in time. I don't know. You know, it’s—there might be a slightly less volume for Bath in building DDG 51s but probably more margin. We just don’t know all the answers yet.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: No, I appreciate it. I mean I know it’s a hard thing to …
Nicholas Chabraja: We’ll find that out as the Navy tells us what their plan is and as we see how their plan is received by particularly the appropriators right now and whether they will, you know, get the funding they want for what they want. But one thing’s for sure. We stand ready to build it, whatever it is, and we’ll work with our customer and the Congress to ensure that Bath Iron Works is well supported. You might know that we were predicting that the Marine group would be our fastest grower over the next three, four years. We still are of that view. Embedded within that view was no increase and a slight decrease in volume at Bath, so this could be a plus, but I don’t just know enough yet to really comment, but I can’t see it being too much downside.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: Thanks, Nick. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Myles Walton of Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer and Company: Thanks, good morning and great quarter Nick.
Nicholas Chabraja: Thanks, Myles.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer and Company:  Question for you. We touched on the high-end large cabin market within Gulfstream. Just curious if you can make some commentary on the midsize and in particular two kind of questions. One is the accelerated depreciation if you’re seeing it tougher to fill some of the 2010 slots across your portfolio and also just general commentary on the demand within the midsection—midsize. Obviously, I know you have less risk there but would be curious for your comments.
Nicholas Chabraja: On the large cabin we’ve blown through the 2010 point a long time ago, so I think the answer to that question is no. And I think with respect to mid-cabin, we haven’t got there yet. Maybe in the G200 I think we are probably into 2010, selling 2010 airplanes for—I don’t think it’s a factor. Yes, we’re into selling entry-into-service aircraft, the G200 now. We’re not there yet on the G150 but will be soon. I don’t think I have enough data to comment on the midsize market. I had heard that Textron indicated that they might see some softening.  We’re doing very well with the G200 product, and I might have detected some softness in the G150 product in the first quarter. On the other hand, we had quite a number of sign-ups soon as the quarter ended, so I would say that it was timing. I don’t have any data which would cause me to change my production planning. Let me put it that way, Myles.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer and Company: OK, that’s fair.
Nicholas Chabraja: Without commenting on the market, I don’t have anything that would suggest that I’m going to ratchet down production, but you know we’ll be quick to do it if we ever get any data because, particularly at the G150, we don’t have the backlog that we do on the very large aircraft where current demand is completely disassociated with my production rate.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer and Company: That’s great and as a quick follow-up if I could. On the 650 order intake, the 100 or so that’s implied, could you give us some geographic breakdown? Is it consistent with the trend that we’re seeing towards 50% to 60% international?
Nicholas Chabraja: It is not at the moment. Let me give you one hint. There’s an odd number, and there are one more North American aircraft order so far than international, so let’s call it 50. And if I had to guess about that, I would say that the North American guys worked the wire transfer jungle drum better than the international guys did. And you can check with me after each quarter, and my suspicion would be that the international number will grow faster than the North American number.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer and Company: Fair enough. Thank you.
Nicholas Chabraja: By the way, Myles, you didn’t ask that question about the existing business in the first quarter, and there the international content was ahead of North America in very much the same proportions that we’ve seen in prior quarters.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer and Company: OK, that’s helpful.
Nicholas Chabraja: Next question.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Doug Harned of Stanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned – Stanford Bernstein: Good morning.
Nicholas Chabraja: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Harned – Stanford Bernstein: I wanted to ask about combat systems and just get an understanding of how the mix is shaping up there. You described that you’ll see some water growth. You expect some water growth in the back half of the year. Can you sort of give an idea of where you’re seeing that growth, aside from Emrab?
Nicholas Chabraja: Yes, you watched the passage of the supplemental not too long ago here. We expect orders emanating from that legislation of which I think you’re pretty much aware.
Doug Harned – Stanford Bernstein: Yes.
Nicholas Chabraja: So I think we’ll in the ordinary course of business have additional orders to report to you here.
Doug Harned – Stanford Bernstein: But it’s not critically growth coming out of European.
Nicholas Chabraja: You’re going to see some growth out of European Land Systems, too, and we’ll make those announcements as we receive the orders.
Doug Harned – Stanford Bernstein: So then there’s some of each then. There’s what you would expect …
Nicholas Chabraja: There’ll be some of each, yes.
Doug Harned – Stanford Bernstein: OK. OK, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Harry Nourse of Bank of America. 
Harry Nourse – Bank of America: Good morning.
Nicholas Chabraja: Good morning, Harry.
Harry Nourse – Bank of America: I was just wondering, obviously, you had a very good second half last year in Combat Systems. It’s going to look pretty flat for the second half looking at the guidance, and then great – it’s going to pick up again. It could even be at the beginning of next year. Could you just walk us through that a bit?
Nicholas Chabraja: I think you have it about right. I wouldn’t call it flat. I think we will be up. We will have more sales in the second half in Combat Systems than we did in the first half. But in the second half we were competing against a very strong third and fourth quarter last year, and I believe our sales will be up over last year but not significantly.
Harry Nourse – Bank of America: OK.
Nicholas Chabraja: And then we’ll pick up again, and you’ll be – we had been forecasting 5% to 6% growth, and I don’t have a better number for you now, but there’s some early indication for optimism. But I’ll do more with you on that subject, Harry, when I’m prepared to give you some more guidance on 2009.
Harry Nourse – Bank of America: OK and for a follow-up the buyback slowed down a bit in 2Q. Perhaps you might just tell us about using the cash and perhaps the outlook for M and A?
Nicholas Chabraja: Let me address sort of forthrightly the issue of buyback. We bought the stock significantly in the first quarter because the price was low. In the second quarter after we announced earnings, the price popped back up, over $90 for most of the quarter. It fell out of bed with the rest of the market sometime in June, late May or June, and we got right back in. And then we came into our blackout period.
Harry Nourse – Bank of America: Sure.
Nicholas Chabraja: So I wouldn’t make much of, you know – if the market gives me a reasonable price for the stock, as it is right, as it has been, we’ll buy it. If it trades up where I think it ought to be, I’ll leave it be. We will continue to pursue acquisitions across a variety of fronts, some indication that things are breaking lose in that area, and we’ll continue to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.  And we’ll continue to reexamine our dividend policy, which we’ve tended to ratchet up from time to time but then, you know, so we’ll visit that again Spring of next year I suspect. But, Harry, I don’t think anything changed much on our view of capital allocation and deployment.
Harry Nourse – Bank of America: Thanks very much.
Operator:  Our next question will come from the line of Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Hi, Nick.
Nicholas Chabraja: Hi, Rob. How are you this morning?
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Pretty good, thanks. Very good quarter. I thought I’d change the topic a little bit to IS and T and ask if you could walk us through the sub-segments there a little bit, perhaps talk about the ICE2 contract. It looks like you got re-upped there a bit at the early part of this month, latter part of last month if you could just give us some more color. You already talked about margins but …
Nicholas Chabraja: I think it’s a very happy story. I think over on the IP services side the renewal of the ICE2 contract was, you know, very good for volume. I think that Advanced Information Systems shows signs of doing well. And of course, our tactical communications business has been really powerful. And I think, to me, the most important thing maybe that occurred was the selection of C4 Systems as part of the team which will provide the provide the airborne, maritime and fixed – the AAMF version of the joint tactical radio system. They’re a significant player on the Lockheed team there. This for us leverages our market-leading position in software-defined radios and places IS and T in principal roles for two of the three JTRS variance, so I think that’s where I would, you know, if you’re looking for a little color across those three segments, that’s what I’d have to say.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse:  Anything else you could tell us about the BIFS [ph 0:41:43] acquisition, the strategy and how you’re thinking there? 
Nicholas Chabraja: Yes, look, I think it’s doing the very same kinds of things that we do. We’re very interested in that growth market, and we see that we can move the BIFS [ph 0:42:02] product and what they do into some of our existing marketplaces, so it’s an effort to move into a growth area.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Any numbers for us there, rough color?
Nicholas Chabraja: No, I don’t want to do that right now.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: OK, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Please proceed.
David Strauss – UBS: Morning, Nick.
Nicholas Chabraja: David, how are you?
David Strauss – UBS: Good. I don’t know if you talked about this already. I was a little late in joining, but Gulfstream margins obviously moving up. The guidance range for this year 18.5 to 18.6. I know in the past you’ve talked about not expecting to get to the kind of margins that Gulfstream that you sold during the last cycle at over 20%. Given the, you know, given the improvement that you’ve seen in margins at Gulfstream, what are you thinking about kind of the long-term target over the course of this cycle?
Nicholas Chabraja: I don’t think about it that way, David. I think we’re going to keep pushing them to get better, and I think that’s in their souls, so I expect continuous improvement. If you look for a snapshot of Gulfstream next year, I would tell you that production probably won’t go up anywhere near as much as it did this year, not because we wouldn’t like to. It’s because we’re getting increasingly close to our efficient capacity there. But when we do improve production – and we will slightly – on the large-cabin aircraft, it implies improvement in productivity because we can’t do it any other way. That implies the in turn improved margins. So I would tell you I expect our guys to get better next year, so we’re getting awful close to the margins we once enjoyed in 2001 before we had midrange, midsized aircraft and before we had the ambitious research and development program today. So, frankly, I’m surprised. I knew we’d make progress. I didn’t believe we’d make this kind of progress, but it also took some aid from the market where we’ve enjoyed some price growth over a period as well, so a lot of good things have happened to this company.
David Strauss – UBS: Right and then as far as R and D, you’ve been level loading that, so there wouldn’t be any anticipated spike up in 2009 or 2010 for the 650, right?
Nicholas Chabraja: Yes. No, we’ve been ramping up, and I think we’re about there, and I think it’d be reasonably level.
David Strauss – UBS: OK and any update on the Saudi order in combat?
Nicholas Chabraja: Our guys are with them negotiating those positions right now, so al the back and forth is going on that needs to make that happen.
David Strauss – UBS: OK, thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Gary Liebowitz of Wachovia Securities. Please proceed.
Gary Liebowitz – Wachovia Securities:  Good morning. Nick, is there any update on the UK FRES program? I guess you started negotiations with the customer there with respect to scope? Any color on the magnitude or the timing of deliveries onto that program?
Nicholas Chabraja: No, they’re just talking away. I mean I don’t know where we are.
Gary Liebowitz – Wachovia Securities: Would it be sometime beyond 2010?
Nicholas Chabraja: Well, I think the program contemplated deliveries in 2012, which was ambitious I think, but I think they’re sticking to it. If they’re going to get there, we’d better get the contract pretty soon. So I can’t tell you when. That’s not within my grasp. These are discussions occurring in the United Kingdom.
Gary Liebowitz – Wachovia Securities: OK, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Ronald Epstein of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ronald Epstein – Merrill Lynch: OK, just a quick follow-on, back to Marine for a minute. Just if you could just give us a quick update on how everything’s going with the Daewoo JV?
Nicholas Chabraja: Absolutely terrific, Ron. We’re producing that first boat. It is together now. It will go to sea before the end of the year. It’s completely enclosed. All the modules are in place. The second one is well along in the same dock, and we’ve commenced construction of the third boat. We’ve found that we’re able to execute against the Daewoo design very well. They’ve been very good partners, very helpful. We have a great relationship. We’re looking at expanding that relationship into other products, very optimistic about it.
Ronald Epstein – Merrill Lynch: And then just one more quick Naval follow-on if I can. I think this is kind of following on Howard’s question. If we do see more interest in DDG 51s and only two DDG1000s get built, what do you think it means for CDX?
Nicholas Chabraja: I don’t have any idea.
Ronald Epstein – Merrill Lynch: OK, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of George Tabaro [ph 0:48:21] of Citi. Please proceed.
George Tabaro – Citi : Nick, a couple of quick follow-ups. You mentioned that in combat that ammunition grew. Now, is that the second source with ATK or is it pretty much across the broad scope of ammunition that you provide?
Nicholas Chabraja: No, it wasn’t the second source other than small amounts. We had – it was across the breadth, but we had some big growth in medium cal, and we had a big win in Canada that caused growth in the company that we acquired there so pretty much across the board. It’s getting to be a good sized business. To give you a little color, George, it’s slightly larger than either Bath Iron Works or Nasco.
George Tabaro – Citi : Oh, it has gotten quite big then.
Nicholas Chabraja: Yes.
George Tabaro – Citi : And if I just switch to Gulfstream quickly, would it be fair to say that given the low investment that you have on the midsize that you’re still running margins at the large jets, probably twice what you are on the midsize?
Nicholas Chabraja: Let me think about that for a minute. It’s close, George. You’re close. Without having data right in front of me, I wouldn’t say yea or nay, but it’s close there, half the margins of the large caliber is a close guess.
George Tabaro – Citi : So then realistically at this point from the large planes you’re actually doing better than what you did in 2001.
Nicholas Chabraja: Oh, yes, of course, way better.
George Tabaro – Citi : Right.
Nicholas Chabraja: And I would have expected that, but the mix shift was what was pulling me down.
George Tabaro – Citi : Right.
Nicholas Chabraja: And the recognition, George, that we weren’t sufficiently supporting research and development, and we had to get going. And also we’ve spent a lot of money in facility now that adds to depreciation expense. But you’re right. Your essential point is correct. The margins are higher on the G550 today than they were on the G5 in 2001, and they’re higher on the 450 than they were on the G4SP, which was being produced at that point in time.
George Tabaro – Citi : OK, thanks very much.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen and Company: Yes, another follow-up on Gulfstream. Nick, you know, you revised margin guidance is about 150 basis points higher than your prior guidance and looks like most of it’s coming in the second half so roughly 200, 300 basis points. And you talk of price, and yet, my recollection is that you were sold out at the end of the first quarter, so I’m a little confused how price can be a factor. And kind of related to that, could you comment on the impact of pull forward of profitable planes possibly from 2009, the negative impact possibly of G650 orders because I understand you have to pay commissions for part of them at the time firm contracts are signed, and thirdly, the potential for supplier participation payments on the 650 as a plus. Thank you.
Nicholas Chabraja: Boy, that’s a mouthful, Cai. Let’s see. You saw in the quarter the effect of commissions paid on the 650, so I think we’re managing that nicely. Margins I predicted were going to be up 20 to 40 basis points at the beginning of the year, 17% to 17.2%. I’m desperately wrong. As far as price is concerned, some of the pricing is embedded in the backlog, and we knew it and could respond to it. That was not true with respect to some of the G200 and G150 sales where we got improved margin.  It was not true with respect to government aircraft, special purpose and special mission aircraft where we were new to the business. We began with the notion that we would sell the platform, and then we started doing the engineering work to modify the aircraft. And finally, we took on the modifications themselves, and we’re cautious about how we do on that. Turns out to be quite a handsome line of business for us. So I think for all of those reasons, price contributed. I think we didn’t experience some of the cost increases we were anticipating. We did gain some efficiencies in productivity that we didn’t think we would or did better than we thought we would. We had some breakthroughs. I think for a whole lot of those reasons we’re doing better than we anticipated.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen and Company: But given that you did pay, you do pay commissions upon the signing of firm contract and given that you are likely to get additional G650 firm contracts in the third and possibly the fourth quarter, isn’t it true that commission payments this year are going to be higher than you anticipated at the end of the first quarter?
Nicholas Chabraja: Modestly.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen and Company: OK. I’ll follow up. Thank you.
Nicholas Chabraja: I mean I don’t think it’s – it’s not such a big issue. We’ve managed that reasonably well.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen and Company: Great.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of today’s conference. I’ll turn the call back to Ms. Amy Gilliland for closing remarks.
Amy Gilliland: I want to thank you for joining the call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3748. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the first quarter 2008 General Dynamics earnings conference call. My name is Carissa and I will be your coordinator for today. (Operator instructions). I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Ray Lewis, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations, please proceed.
Ray Lewis: Thank you very much Carissa and welcome everyone in the investment community as well as the financial media who are on the call today. As always I want to remind you that any forward looking statements we make today represent our best estimates as to what the future may hold, but obviously are subject to the uncertainties that face any business. And those risk factors are dealt with at some length in our 10Qs and 10Ks, I would recommend you take a look at those if you haven’t already. With that said, I would like to move on and turn it over to our Chief Executive Officer, Nick Chabraja.  
Nick Chabraja:  Thanks Ray and good morning. I think our results are pretty straightforward so I can be pretty brief. If you’ve seen the press release for the quarter you can understand why I’m extremely pleased with the performance of General Dynamics. Sales were up 11.2% and earnings from continuing operations were up 30.2%. Earnings per share were $1.42 on a fully diluted basis, well ahead of everyone’s expectations including my own.  We obviously enjoyed tremendous operating leverage in the quarter. Margins improved 150 basis points year over year. Each business segment improved margins significantly over both first quarter 2007 and maybe more importantly to me, fourth quarter 2007. Arguably, the best thing about the quarter from a forward looking perspective was the strong order intake. As a result of nearly $10 billion of orders, our backlog grew by $3 billion to almost $50 billion. The growth in backlog was most dramatic in the combat systems and IS&T segments. But each of our four segments ended the quarter with more backlog than at the beginning of the quarter.  The company generated $346 million of cash, after capital expenditures which is about 60% of net income from continuing operations. I think that’s kind of typical for first quarter. In my 15 years here, we’ve had two great first quarters, happened to be last two years, but as I look back, first quarter’s traditionally been weaker. But I can say that it’s stronger in any event than our plan provided for and I’m fully confident that we will meet or exceed our bogey of 100% conversion of net earnings into cash in the year. Overall, performance was spectacular with each segment having a good quarter, some in painfully obvious ways and others in more subtle ways.  I’d like to give you a little color on each of the four segments, maybe I’ll begin with Gulfstream. Sales increased 17% year over year and margins improved 270 basis points. Gulfstream’s book to bill expressed in dollars was 1.18 times for the quarter. This is the eighth consecutive quarter with a book to bill greater than 1. As a result, backlog at Gulfstream increased 200 million during the quarter. Let me make very clear that this increase in backlog and order intake is with respect to airplanes currently in production. As you know we launched the G650 product on March 13th but did not begin taking letters of intent and initial refundable deposits until this quarter, until April 15th. I’m pleased to say that the G650 has been well received in the marketplace and we are now engaged in the process of converting letters of intent into contracts which will result in orders in the second quarter.  Gulfstream operating margins were spectacular to say the least at 18.5%, aided in part by some launch assistance payments, but nevertheless, a very strong performance. Combat systems, this was another great quarter for them with revenue increasing by 27% year over year. Margins improved 190 basis points resulting in a nearly 50% increase in operating earnings. Backlog improved 1.4 billion during the quarter. The largest single stimulus to revenue growth this quarter and frankly to earnings growth was the MRAP program which ramped up quickly and will also ramp down rather quickly. Fortunately demand for our other products will replace this volume as the year progresses. Margins were great at 13% but let me say not sustainable at that rate throughout the year. Nevertheless, combat systems will have a great year and I think clearly outperform our earlier guidance.  Marine systems, sales improved 9.6% over the same quarter a year ago, nice up. Earnings improved 25% and margins 110 basis points. Backlog increased over 500 million during the quarter. This quarter’s performance marks the fourth straight quarter of margins above 8%, evidence of stability, completion of our turnaround and of our continuous improvement. IS&T, the story in the information systems and technology segment is a little more subtle than the other three segments but encouraging nonetheless. Consistent with a constrained market, strong competition, revenue in the North American market was flat year over year.  Meanwhile the Bowman program continued its slow ramp down. We have however reached what we think is steady state for our business in the United Kingdom. And while revenue for the whole segment declined 1%, margins improved 60 basis points resulting in 4% improvement year over year operating earnings. Total backlog, a real good story, increased 800 million while IDIQ contract balances increased over 400 million. Importantly for us, this is the third straight quarter of increased backlog for IS&T. The growing backlog will result in good revenue growth in the second half of the year but at margins lower than the first quarter and more consistent with last year.  In summary, by almost any measure, this was a great quarter. Given this quick start, it is apparent to me that our original guidance to you was conservative. However, we will make a comprehensive analysis during the second quarter and provide detailed guidance on the second quarter earnings call consistent with our practice the last few years. I’d like Hugh Redd our Chief Financial Officer to provide some additional color and to fill in some of the details and then we’ll deal with your questions.
Hugh Redd:  Alright, thank you Nick, let me start with interest expense which is down $7 million or 27% compared to the first quarter of 2007 and that’s primarily due to increased earnings on our cash balances. I should say that the impact of interest income however was less than we expected and that’s for three reasons. First, we saw disruptions or as we saw disruptions in the capital markets early in the quarter, we moved towards more secure investments. We weren’t alone in the flight to quality and accordingly yields on the highest quality investments dropped.  Second, during the quarter we accrued approximately $6 million of interest expense related to the settlement of a dispute in the aerospace segment, the principle amount of which we had substantially reserved in prior periods. The third reason was lower than expected cash balances due to share repurchases. Taking these factors into consideration, we see the interest expense for the full year to be in the $55-$65 million range. Speaking of share repurchases, during the quarter we spent $519 million to repurchase 6.3 million shares at an average price of $82.96. Taxes for the quarter were 32.2% and that’s consistent with our expectations of 32.5% for the full year.  Nick mentioned backlog and discussed the strong order intake and resulting backlog, I should point out that we adjusted orders and backlog downward to reflect our expectations for the Pandur vehicle program in the Czech Republic. Discussions with the customer are progressing well and are expected to result in a definitive agreement for a lesser quantity of vehicles but on terms and conditions that will be favorable to both parties. Ray that concludes my remarks.
Ray Lewis:  Thank you very much Hugh. Carissa, if you will once I have set down the ground rules explain once again how to get into the queue for Q&A. As we have for some time, we ask that you ask one question so that everyone has a chance to ask questions. If you have more than one question please get back into the end of the queue after you’ve asked your one question. Okay, Carissa if you could explain now how they can get into the queue once again. 
Operator:  (Operator instructions). And your first question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Citigroup, please proceed.
George Shapiro – Citigroup:  Good morning. If you could go through a little more color on how on the Gulfstream margin I mean you mentioned a supplier payment so maybe if you could talk about how much, how R&D as a percentage of sales was and maybe if there was any issues with SG&A, so I can kind of get a feel for what may be the real incremental margin might have been because on the surface they were great numbers and it looked like the mix was somewhat unfavorable with more of the lower, mid-sized aircraft too.
Nick Chabraja:  George, we got about $15 million in launch assistance in the quarter. It was a little more than is typical. So our R&D was down a touch. I don’t think we’ll have a major impact in the second quarter. But as the year goes by, we don’t see the margins for the first and second quarter repeating. That having been said, I’m going to tell you that there’s some moving parts, it’s slightly unpredictable but my earlier guidance to you all in this segment is going to be conservative, because I was looking for margins in the low 17% range for the year.  We’re not going to do that, we’re going to be better than that. But I don’t see for the year that we’re going to be as good as we were in the quarter either. Although the second quarter will also be strong, I want to alert you to that right now. So I hope in general I’ve answered your question.
George Shapiro – Citigroup:  Yeah if I could just follow just a little bit so if you looked at the percentage of the revenues for R&D this quarter, what was it 50 or 100 basis points less than what it was last year?
Nick Chabraja:  No because otherwise we’d be ramping up George, it’s about the same.
George Shapiro – Citigroup:  Same as a percentage of sales which means the R&D was higher?
Nick Chabraja:  The amount is the same, we’re ramping up, I don’t have percentages here at the tip of my tongue. The amount was the same.
George Shapiro – Citigroup:  Okay.
Nick Chabraja:  On higher revenues.
George Shapiro – Citigroup:  Right so as a percentage it was down, okay, thanks very much Nick.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Co., please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.: Yes, thanks an awful lot. Nick, could you comment on two things, first you know I gather you were going to start accepting orders for the 650 as of the middle of April, where are we on that process and give us a little update on the color of what you’re seeing on the big jet market.
Nick Chabraja:  On April the 15th Cai, we began a process that included the acceptance of letters of intent from our customers supported by a $500,000 refundable deposit. We received a significant number of those, what some might call it an overwhelming response. We obviously can’t make everybody happy when you get sort of oversubscribed.  But we’re going to begin the process now in an orderly way and we’ve already begun it of converting those letters of intent into full contracts for the purchase of the 650 and orders. We’ll do that in an orderly and methodical way and I think you know it behooves us not to spend all of our time on the 650 because those represent orders for aircraft to be delivered beginning four years from now.  And the continue to focus on more current demand. The market continues to look good to us, we had a good quarter from an order intake point of view, we’re off to a good start. This quarter for orders unrelated to the 650, we had one cancellation in the quarter, we cancelled the customer who proved too difficult. I don’t see it as any harbinger of things to come. The dollar volume of orders we provide to you is a net of that cancellation. Market looks good, particularly strong internationally, in the first quarter I would say that, trying to remember I think 56-57% of the orders were international as opposed to North America. So that trend from last year is continuing.  So really a terrific response overseas. And our backlog for the large aircraft, the 550 and the 450 is problematic right now. We have with 550 we have entry at the service availability starting kind of in 2013, last quarter of 2012 and 2013. So sales guys have a tough job out there selling product that’s not available for four or five years.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.: Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley, please proceed.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Good morning Nick, I want to work off of Cai’s question for just a minute. Can you bandwidth for us a little more specifically you define an overwhelming response on the 650, I mean did you see something like 30 orders or 50?
Nick Chabraja:  If you were listening carefully I made no mention of orders. The process and it is a process is to request letters of intent supported by deposits, refundable deposits. Those deposits were timestamps in an identifiable process and now we’re going through those in order, one by one, attempting to convert.  If you looked at the fact that we anticipated 17 aircraft for entry in the service in 2012 and 66 over the next two years, that was our initial plan, you have 83 aircraft in the first two and a half years of the program. The original response is a six to seven times that availability. So we’ll see how all that shakes out as we begin the process of converting. But it’s a very successful response.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: So then help us understand the, when you, the thought process you’re going through when you look at the struggles of your salesmen to sell airplanes out five years, ten, obviously an amazing response on the G650, how are you going to go about the decision about whether to raise your capabilities here?
Nick Chabraja:  We’ll do our very best to ramp up production here. Our initial production planning is inconsistent with the demand. We’ll have to re-plan and pulse our supply chain and you know take them dragging and kicking with us, it’s going to be a successful program for all of us. So I think it’s fair to say we’ll produce more airplanes than that. But we’re at the very early stages of dealing with demand that we didn’t anticipate.  A lot of very good friends of mine are very unhappy about their number in the queue and all that will sort itself out as we work hard at improving production and also seeing who’s for real in this sign up process. So it presents us with a problem but a happy problem.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Thanks, one last question if we break out the MRAP on combat systems, what do the normalized margins look like ex-MRAP.
Nick Chabraja:  I can’t tell you Heidi because I haven’t done that calculation. We’re going to get a mix shift later in the year as MRAP which is a highly profitable program declines and it’s replaced by good business at good margins but now the way MRAP was. You’ll see some degradation of that margin. But here again, combat systems, we’re going to beat our guidance. We will in all four segments. And I just need to take some time to calibrate where that is and give you some good advice.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Okay, thanks very much Nick.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies, please proceed.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.: Thank you very much. To talk about something on the ground instead or maybe in the water, Nick, tell us a little bit about what’s going on in marine? The numbers are better, you’ve got a new full carrier you know that you’re working on in NASSCO, you were starting on [somewalt] and LCS, kind of package it all, where are the puts and takes? And then clearly DDG is reaching the final stages of being a successful program.
Nick Chabraja:  Well yeah look I think Howard, volume was up nicely in the quarter, that helped for efficiency’s sake, they had I think surprisingly good margins, better than anticipated. NASSCO has turned around, they’re not reporting great earnings but they’re reporting earnings and they’re poised to get better. And the yard is full of work, they’re doing very well on the T-AKE program, learning is outstanding. They’re doing very well on the first product carrier tanker and starting the second one. So far we’re well within our budgets and things are progressing nicely.  And I think that over time they’re going to be a significant contributor to the profit potential of the group. Things at Electric Boat are very good. Efficiency on the Virginia class program continues to improve, everyone whose participating is doing well. We’re pleased with our relationship with Northop Grumman Newport News, cooperation is good, performance is good across the board and we now see the second submarine in the navy’s plan for FY11 and we’ll begin to see revenue from that in calendar year 10 if not somewhat before. So you have two shipyards in very good shape and getting better. And one in transition that we need to watch, it’s not without transitory risk.  That’s BIW, high performance facility doing extremely well on the DDG program. But we have five left to deliver. They’re highly profitable. We’ll replace that work with the DDG-1000 and have maybe some LCS work and some other work that we’re undertaking now. But we have a period of change where the mix is shifting and we’ll have to be careful there, that’s the watch item. But I think we’ll get through it and hold our own on volume, I’m not so sure we’ll hold the margin rate that they currently enjoy. But the bigger pieces of the puzzle are the other two shipyards and they’re both full speed ahead. So I like the way the marine group is shaping up. Mike Toner and his operating guys have done a great job.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.: Thanks Nick.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Joe Campbell of Lehman Brothers, please proceed.
Analyst for Joe Campbell – Lehman Brothers: Good morning, it’s actually Carter Copeland, good morning Nick. Good quarter. I wondered if you might talk to us just briefly in sort of general terms about the issue of finding your successor and see if you could give us some general color on the process and how that’s going and things you’re looking for just to help us think through this issue a bit.
Nick Chabraja:  I don’t know that you have to do a whole lot of thinking Carter, I think we’ll have an announcement for you sometime next month. So I think the decision has largely been made or will have its final deliberations either at their May Board meeting or if they don’t conclude it’ll be in June, but you’ll have an answer very soon.
Analyst for Joe Campbell – Lehman Brothers: Great and then one quick one, on IS&T in the North American revenues being flat, it seemed that the GDUK piece would have been about where you expected but North America, any chance you could provide some color on how far short that may have fallen of your expectations?
Nick Chabraja:  It’s pretty much the same old same old Carter, we were down in IT services from our expectations a little bit on weakness in the commercial market where we provide infrastructure for a number of telecom companies. And that’s been persistent over the last several quarters. And we’ve had not quite as much infrastructure work as we’ve enjoyed in the past from our own net, what used to be called network systems business. We also have been pointing out weakness in our advance information systems business from a revenue perspective in the classified world that remain the same.  And we had a little bit of outperformance at C4 systems. So all in all, we were okay, I’d say a touch behind our revenue plan. Our revenue plan and the guidance I’ve given you always provided for a ramp. And we indicated if I remember correctly that we’d have about 5-6% organic revenue growth for the year, I think that’s still a very good piece of guidance. I think the upside in this particular segment could come from margin expansion.
Analyst for Joe Campbell – Lehman Brothers: Great, thank you very much, it’s very useful.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Oppenheimer, please proceed.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks, good quarter. Nike a question for you on M&A, you’ve been reasonably quiet here for a little while, has the deteriorating credit environment coupled with probably lower cash interest rates made you more interested in deals and could you comment on availability in pricing as well.
Nick Chabraja:  You know we’re always looking for deals Myles, we have a strong balance sheet and we’re always looking at strengthening our business and growing it. When we don’t see opportunities, we sit tight. The opportunity in the last quarter was obviously we repurchased our own shares when the market made them extremely attractive and accretive for us. We keep looking and talking to folks and harder to borrow money for large transactions I think but transactions of reasonable size I think given our balance sheet, it’s not an issue.  I think the question of pricing is yet to resolve itself. It’s moving around here. People don’t quite understand what pricing is like. I mean there’s some competing elements out here and one thing is if you can get financing it’s at lower rates which has the effect of increasing pricing. The tightness of money and the general squirmishness of the market suggests PE multiple compression which can have an impact on pricing. But it’s too hard to generalize about that right now. We just keeping working it and see what happens.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: That’s fair enough if I could squeeze in one on the 650 order interest could you qualify how much of that interest is from legacy Gulfstream customers and how much you might be pulling over some share from your other competitor in the market?
Nick Chabraja:  I can’t right now Myles but we intentionally made this an open process. In other words we didn’t favor long term Gulfstream customers, which I’m sure some of them in their hearts will say is unfair. On the other hand when you do that, you don’t take share. So this is our intention to get customers from all kinds of aircraft. Myles, look, there’s another way to look at this.  In this segment, at least at the moment I think we have all of the share because there isn’t a competing aircraft in my view. Now there may well be some day but right now it’s not a share issues, it’s trying to get folks who are in the family, in the loyal family of our competitors into our aircraft so that they are exposed to the entire line and that they begin with our flagship, the 650, we’re pleased with that.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Fair enough, thanks for taking my questions.
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Steve Binder of Bear Stearns, please proceed.
Steve Binder – Bear Stearns: Nick, I think maybe I didn’t hear you correctly but George had asked earlier about kind of the overall SG&A and R&D bucket on a year over year basis because in your K you nicely parse out kind of incremental gross margin versus how much SG&A and R&D hurt or helped you. So can you maybe touch on a year over year basis how much that total bucket in absolute dollars moved?
Nick Chabraja:  Yeah maybe Hugh can help you.
Hugh Redd:  The same quarter last year we were at $23 million in R&D and we’re $23 million this quarter so that’s I think like 2.1% for the first quarter of 07 versus 1.8% the first quarter of 08. And you know it bounces around in a band that you know, it’s fairly tight but you know in some quarters when we have a lot of launch assistance which would net against that, then we could go down as low $5-$10 million and in some quarters we’ve been as high as $30 million. So last year we ended up the year at $85 million of R&D at Gulfstream and we’re kind of on that pace again this year. So.
Steve Binder – Bear Stearns: Right that’s just R&D, how about SG&A though?
Hugh Redd:  SG&A, you know I think this quarter is about $75 million additional because I think we’re up around a little over $100 million for the quarter. That goes up with launches, or excuse me with selling expense, a little bit higher this quarter because of selling expense related to the 650. Other quarters if we have large order intakes or milestones on aircraft under order then we have commissions to the sales force. So I suspect that didn’t totally answer your question.
Steve Binder – Bear Stearns:  I’m trying to get a handle on incremental gross margins because it looks like you know if SG&A is up you had probably better than 35-40% incremental gross margins and I’m just wondering is that pretty much all on new aircraft, did you see expansion of the service business?
Hugh Redd:  You know margins are improving across the new aircraft and across service business and then you have a mix issue across the two. So it’s a little hard to answer the question with a single answer. 
Nick Chabraja: Steve, you can’t solve this, I’ll help you by telling you you had a great mix quarter. There were no 350’s, there were no 500’s, there was great growth in the pure fleet of the large aircraft and you also had improving margins in the smaller ones. So all of that contributed and that won’t be the same every quarter.
Steve Binder – Bear Stearns:  Alright and then Nick you said you’re going to recalibrate in all your sectors in Q2 but combat systems you touched on it about the strength and the great performance in the quarter, I don’t think I remember a quarter where the first quarter margin represented the highest margin for the year of any quarter for combat systems. So is that going to hold true again this year?
Nick Chabraja: I have never had a program like MRAP that was a quick start quick finish. You begin booking, starts in the second half of last year for us effectively, you begin as you would keeping warranty reserves and everything conservative and prudent and now you’re well on your way and you’ve got to begin taking your profit. And it’ll end so if you didn’t get that, you weren’t listening very well.
Steve Binder – Bear Stearns:  Thanks so much.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS, please proceed.
David Strauss – UBS: Good afternoon, thank you. Nick, is part of the reluctance to raise guidance at this point to kind of see how the supplemental works out and when that comes in?
Nick Chabraja: It’s a piece of it but I think you know the supplemental for us is probably more risk than upside. Some of its baked into our plan, that which we will enjoy this year and it’s the out years where this is some upside for us. I really want to understand fully the implications of this performance. Before I go and give you guidance.  I don’t want to, as I’ve told you in prior years, I don’t want to give you water torture, I would rather give you a good number and kind of stick with it. If we beat that number it’s because we performed great and if we miss it it’s because we ran into some risks that I didn’t see. But I’d rather give you a good number than just be noodling it little by little here. There’s some pieces of the puzzle that I’m missing right now.
David Strauss – UBS: Okay and then as far as combat systems, kind of thinking beyond 08, I don’t know if you’ll want to go there but you talked in the past I think about you know obviously a moderating growth rate in 09 versus 08 given MRAP’s rolling off but I think you’ve talked about a 5-6% kind of top line growth rate for combat, is that something that you’re still comfortable with?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah, next year you’re talking about?
David Strauss – UBS: Yeah, 09 for combat.
Nick Chabraja: Yeah, that’s where we think we’re going to go. We think you’re going to have a 5ish growth rate in 09 and 10.
David Strauss – UBS: Okay, great, thanks a lot Nick.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Rob Epstein of Merrill Lynch, please proceed.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch: Good morning guys. Just a question Nick on what you’re seeing in terms of international activity in defense business. You know there’s been talk about potential orders from the Saudis and some other things so if you could just give us some color on what’s going on in the international community and in your defense business.
Nick Chabraja: Yeah, you know our international business has been stable for the last three years at about 18% of our overall revenue. Now Gulfstream’s international business is growing but it hasn’t yet found its way in significant parts into our revenue numbers, right, that is to come because we’ve been talking about quarters together. So while their international revenues have been going up marginally year over year, it’s not been big.  And our non-US government commercial work or defense work is the better way to put it, has been stable over the last three years at about $3 billion a year. That should go up as we you know begin to deliver at [Elks] on our backlog. And as we begin to enjoy the Saudi program which we believe will reduce to contracts this year, but that’s kind of a little bit in 09 and a lot in 10 and 11. So that’s where we should see some growth in our international defense business. Whether it will be a overall growth in percentage terms I’m not quite certain.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch: Okay, okay and just one follow on on the commercial ship JV out at NASSCO, how is that proceeding?
Nick Chabraja: Great, I think I’ve talked to that a little earlier. I said that we’re a little over 50% done with PC1, it’s shaping up in the doc real good. We’re beating our internal budgets and forecasts. It’s a little too early to declare victory, we’ll get through some tougher parts of the ship a little later but so far it looks very good. We plan to deliver that ship I guess early in next year and then start to deliver one every six to eight months thereafter. So we’re doing well with that program.  The second ship is under construction now and our build strategy seems to be working out beautifully. Every week I get pictures of the progress of product carrier 1 and it’s really remarkable how quickly that ship’s coming together.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch: Great, super, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford & Bernstein, please proceed.
Doug Harned – Sanford & Bernstein: Hi, good morning. On IS&T again you talked about why the revenues are flat this year, US revenues. But when you look at the backlog growth that you mentioned earlier I mean that’s quite substantial. Can you talk about where that’s coming from, AIS, C4 Systems, information technology?
Nick Chabraja: It’s kind of spread all around. Let me see if I, I’ve got a list of program wins and so forth. Notable contract awards during the quarter, we got $374 million at AIS which has been part of the problem. And you know look I’ll give you a list Doug of contract wins, it’s a lot of different things, it’s a long, long list and I think that we’re addressing our shortfall. But these are the things that give me encouragement that we’re proceeding as we planned to have 5-6% growth in the year which suggests the growth in the latter half of the year is going to be much stronger than that.
Doug Harned – Sanford & Bernstein: But C4 Systems has been pretty strong relative to the others. Do you expect going forward that there’ll be any shift in mix given the program wins you’re seeing elsewhere?
Nick Chabraja: No I don’t think so. I think C4 looks powerful. If anything, some of their programs that they’ve won years ago are maturing now and can be significant contributors. That business looks very powerful to me. I think we’ll do ok here but again I want to say that our guidance, our earlier guidance on revenue in this segment is not changing. I don’t expect that to go up. In fact I think they’ll fight like hell to get it to 5-6% revenue growth.  What I want to explore before I give you guidance in considerable detail is the possibility of margin expansion. It’s suggested by the first quarter performance and I want to run that to ground. We could do a little better there for margins then we can beat the 3-4% growth over last year which is what I had given you in our earlier guidance. I told you that the operating earnings would grow in the 3-4% range. And we’ll see if we can’t do better and I’ll have an answer for you next quarter this time.
Doug Harned – Sanford & Bernstein: Okay, great, thank you.
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr of Stifel Nicolaus, please proceed.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus:  Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about margins at IS&T, a little stronger than we were looking for this quarter, pretty nice compared to last couple quarters. Anything going on there in particular and is this a sustainable level around this 11%?
Nick Chabraja: Look I think I just talked about that more than a little bit. It was a good quarter, surprised me a little bit. There was nothing unusual in the quarter. You know, no strange one off items. They are telling us internally that this is not sustainable at this level. But I have indications that for the year, they will outperform their plan where I had previously guided you, that would be 3-4% operating earnings growth or EBIT growth over the course of the year. If their margins improve as I believe they will, not over this 11% but over the forecast, we have some upside opportunity at IS&T and I want to quantify that and give you more careful guidance.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus:  Is it just a mix in the back half of the year on why it’s not sustainable?
Nick Chabraja: The 11% wasn’t predicted. So we have to go to the root cause of the improvement before I can tell you how we’ll turn out. We don’t have a mix shift here going on, we just probably had some good performance on programs in the quarter. But see if we can’t repeat it, instead of guessing about it.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay and update on JLTV, kind of where your team stands and kind of how, what you’re thinking about the down select coming up.
Nick Chabraja: I don’t think anybody’s put in an RFP yet. Yeah we have, okay. So it’s coming up in July, what do you want me to do, handicap?
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus:  I’m just wondering how you guys are progressing on that.
Nick Chabraja: [Overlay] that puts stuff in the newspaper. I don’t, the customer is going to make that decision not me. I think if we put in a response to the RFP we’ve got a good team, like our partner, strong capable people. We’ll see what happens. They’re going to down select to what three I think. Let’s wait till the customer announces.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus:  Sure, thanks.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of J.P. Morgan, please proceed.
Joe Nadol – J.P. Morgan Securities: Good morning. On Gulfstream Nick, I’m wondering if there was some service revenue decline or some disruption in the quarter, because the shift of your mix was good. And so what happened there?
Nick Chabraja: I think that the service people did okay too. Let me take a quick look at it. Yeah, no, they did a good job. They were, Joe let’s think because you and I had a little debate about what the revenue would ultimately be. You know I think I was suggesting 680 and you were about 700. You look a little better than I do right now.
Joe Nadol – J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay. Well then overall for Gulfstream I guess I’m a little surprised that revenues weren’t a little higher given the delivery mix, the service grew, is there something else going on. Obviously you gave us pre-owned sales numbers but anything else?
Nick Chabraja: I don’t, no. I can’t strike up your revenue expectations with the results. I don’t think we had very much pre-owned in the quarter at all.
Joe Nadol – J.P. Morgan Securities: No. Okay and then on free cash flow could you give maybe by segments where, and I’m splitting hairs a little bit, but where maybe some of the shortfall might have been?
Nick Chabraja: Well from our plan there wasn’t a shortfall but it was in combat systems if you want to think about a big needle mover here. We have about $200-$225 million of inventory in the Czech Republic program. And while we’ve made significant progress with them and entered into a memorandum of understanding about restructuring that program, we didn’t get the vehicles delivered or the money collected. That would have been a major driver. So I would say that of the performance of all the groups, combat systems had the weakest cash performance relative to plan because of that.
Joe Nadol – J.P. Morgan Securities: But it should bounce back in Q2?
Nick Chabraja: Well one would hope, yeah, I mean they’re going to go through some tests of those vehicles and some adjustment of them to suit the Czech army but I think we’re making considerable progress there and that the parties are working together in a harmonious way to restructure that program.
Joe Nadol – J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Gary Liebowitz of Wachovia Securities, please proceed.
Gary Liebowitz – Wachovia Securities: Thank you, good morning gentlemen. Nick has the timing of the Saudi vehicle order expectations changed relative to three months ago, like LAVs you still expect in the first half of the year.
Nick Chabraja: If anything it slipped a quarter. 
Gary Liebowitz – Wachovia Securities: Okay and also you gave for and by the way are the semi-tanks, is that a second half event still?
Nick Chabraja: I think we’re looking at both of them in the second half. We have three different things going right now. The Saudi National Guard LAVs, the tank for the army and LAVs for the army as well. So we have three different programs all at work here, all being negotiated and it is a process, let me say. It takes always longer than one would think. But we think everything looks good. It looks very good as a matter of fact.
Gary Liebowitz – Wachovia Securities: Okay also did you give, you said fourth quarter 2012 for quoting service entry now for new G550’s, what is the period for G450’s?
Nick Chabraja: A year short of that.
Gary Liebowitz – Wachovia Securities: Okay, thank you.
Ray Lewis:  Carissa I think we have time for one more question.
Operator:  Your final question will come from the line of Rob Spingam of Credit Suisse, please proceed.
Rob Spingam – Credit Suisse: Hey guys. Nick, going back to the backlog and maybe you just answered this question, but the unfunded portion that combat systems had a nice uptick since last quarter, $1 billion plus, is there anything there that wasn’t in the press release?
Nick Chabraja: I think it’s the Abrams SEP multi-year.
Rob Spingam – Credit Suisse: Okay and then on the same topic, any update at this point on UK FRES?
Nick Chabraja: No, I mean it’s just where it was the last time we talked. It’s there for decision in the MOD. 
Rob Spingam – Credit Suisse: Okay and then you brought up something earlier that prompts another question going back to Gulfstream, you’re currently delivering largely domestic aircraft I guess, you said the international order flow doesn’t really convert to deliveries for a while. At what point will your deliveries be over 50% international if and when that happens?
Nick Chabraja: Probably three years from now. I’m guessing but that’s about what it, you know today’s orders become deliveries in three or four years, so that’s what you’re looking at.
Rob Spingam – Credit Suisse:  Okay, excellent, thank you Nick
Ray Lewis:  Okay I want to thank everyone for being on the call today. Many of you know this, some of you don’t. I will be retiring in June so this is my last earnings conference call. The very capable Amy Gilliland will be my successor coming in June. And I just want to take an opportunity to say what a great privilege and pleasure it has been for the last 16 years to be working here. All of that time in one way or another with Nick and how much I’ve appreciated the staff here at corporate headquarters and the support they’ve given me over the years throughout.  And I have to say something about the operating people and the way they deliver for the customer and for shareholders and the cash generation that has been such a driver for shareholder value the time I’ve been here. So my 40 years of laboring in the corporation communications vineyard this has certainly been the highlight of my career. And with that Amy and I are going to get a quick bite to eat. My number is 703-876-3195, Amy’s is 703-876-3748 and we’ll be happy to take your questions this afternoon and good day.
Operator:  Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation, you may now disconnect, good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2007 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Maria and I will be your audio coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode, and we will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the presentation over to, Mr. Ray Lewis, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Ray Lewis - Staff Vice President of Investor Relations: Well, thank you very much Maria, and greetings to the members of the Investment community, as well as, the business press that are listening today. We had a great quarter; I would like to remind everyone that there may be some forward-looking statements made today. These will represent our best estimates of future performance but they are subject to the risks of any normal business. And as I remind you each quarter, you can get a more detailed exposition on what those risks are, if you look at our 10-Qs and 10-Ks.  With that said, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Nick Chabraja.
Nick Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Ray and good morning. I'm pleased to report that fourth quarter 2007 is obviously a very strong finish to what has been a spectacular year for us. The fourth quarter results represent the highest revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow we have ever been pleased to report to you.  Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.42 for the quarter compared to $1.13 for the fourth quarter 2006 at 25.7% increase. And for the full year, earnings from continuing operations were $5.10 for fully diluted share, an increase of almost 21.5% over 2006. This growth in earnings in both the quarter and for the full year was driven by strong revenue growth and significantly improved margins, we achieved terrific operating leverage.  Let's take a brief look at both, revenue and operating margins. Revenues for the quarter grew to $7.5 billion from $6.5 billion this $1 billion increase represents 15.4% growth over the fourth quarter of 2006. At the same time operating margins increased 80 basis points to 11.6%. Full year revenues were $27.2 billion, up 13.2%. Operating margins for the full year increased 50 basis points to 11.4 from 10.9 in the prior year. Free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter was approximately $900 million, for the full year free cash flow from continuing operations totaled approximately $2.5 billion, which represents a 119% of net income from continuing operations, about 19% better than I've been guiding you through the course of the year until maybe the fourth quarter. As a result of this strong cash generation, we ended the year with cash and short-term investments, nicely in excess of our total debt, in fact in excess by almost $270 million. We also ended the year with funded and total backlog at all time highs. Obviously, we could not be more pleased with the earnings and the cash generated by our business segments this year and the strength of our balance sheet leaves us in a powerful position to add value during the course of the year. Let me now address the segment detail and lay a little ground work by segment for the 2008 guidance that I gave you in the press release. I'll start with Aerospace, Gulfstream. I was obviously very pleased with Gulfstream's performance in the first three quarters of the year, and I am further impressed by what they accomplished in the fourth quarter. Sales increased 17.2% for the quarter and were up a similar amount for the full year. Operating margins continue to improve. Both fourth quarter and full year margins improved 120 basis points over last year.  As a direct result of the 17% revenue increase and improved margins, earnings were $212 million in the quarter and $810 million for the full year, an all time record. Both increases are about 26% greater than last year. The book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 2.14 times resulting in a further significant increase in backlog. So, as we look into 2008, we're forecasting revenue growth of 13% to 15% for Gulfstream with margins improving yet again between 20 to 40 basis points over 2007. In other words, I'll look for operating margins for the full year between 17% and 17.2%.  Alright, let's move to Combat Systems. Revenue in Combat Systems segment grew 46.5% for the quarter and a full 30.3% for the year. Growth in this segment has been absolutely phenomenal and is attributable in large part to growth in combat vehicle market worldwide. However, we experienced growth across each and every product line within the segment. Margins for the quarter were 12.2%, up a 150 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year margins increased 40 basis points to 11.7%.  Needless to say, the combination of 30% revenue growth and 40 basis point margin improvement resulted in powerful growth in operating earnings up 35.3% for the year. So, what do we do for non-core? For 2009, we believe revenues will continue to grow somewhere between 9% to 10% and margins should improve again another 30 to 50 basis points. So, continuing healthy bottom line growth out of Combat Systems. Marine Systems. In Marine Systems Group, revenues were modestly up for the quarter and for the year. I'm very pleased, however, by the margin improvement this year, better than I thought it would be. Margins were 8.3% for the quarter and 8.4% for the full year. As a result, operating earnings improved a little bit over 20% for the quarter and over 12% for the entire year. Next year, we expect revenues to increase between 3% and 4% and margins to improve another 10 to 20 basis points. Let me tarry a minute here. You notice, we are forecasting relatively modest growth next year and some continuing slugging it out in the trenches for a little more margin improvement, really good hard work by these guys. What you don't know is that in the out years and throughout the course of our plan, Marine Systems is forecasted to be the strongest grower in terms of compound annual growth rate through 2011 and you will see that hit in each of the years, '09, '10 and '11. So in '09, we're looking for something in excess of 9% growth here and we feel pretty confident about that. Lastly, Information Systems and Technology, sales were off about 2% for the quarter, but up 6.6% for the full year. This requires some normalization. As you know, we are experiencing the slow but steady ramp down of the BOWMAN program in the United Kingdom, a very large program. Additionally, the year-over-year comparison is somewhat skewed by the acquisition of Anteon during the course of 2006. So adjusting for these events, we calculate a modest 3% increase in North American based revenue year-over-year. Margins have declined slightly, 20 basis points in the quarter and 10 basis points for the year. You may recall of my earlier guidance to you, anticipated declines in margins closer to 50 basis points. So, it is a very good job to close the gap. I would like to have seen more growth and improved margins, but the year was better than we had expected. Importantly, the group's backlog increased nicely during the fourth quarter. As we look at 2008, we see top line growth, organic growth between 5% and 6%. And further modest pressure on margins. Taken together, operating earnings should grow year-over-year by 3% to 5%. In summary, we had a good quarter and a great year. We had two businesses, Aerospace and Combat Systems that really hit it out at the ball park. The Marine Systems Group had a solid year with margins back to levels we haven't seen in some time. And the IS&T Group has done a good job managing a pause in portions -- identifiable portions of its market. By the way, Information Systems and Technology is the first line of business of General Dynamics to top 1 billion of operating earnings in a year. No small feat. It should be joined in 2008 by Combat Systems with Gulfstream not far behind. In my view, all four of our lines of business are well positioned. Accordingly, we see earnings per share in 2008 increasing to a range of $5.55 to $5.65, which is between 9% and 11% earnings per share growth. As I pointed out earlier, our relatively powerful balance sheet leaves us some opportunity to improve this because the guidance I gave you does not take into account any potential deployment of capital. I think Hugh Redd has some additional detail that might not be apparent in the attachments to our press release. So, Hugh?
Hugh Redd - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President: Thank you, Nick. Let me start with taxes. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.8%, which included modest true ups and discrete items. But the effective rate for the full year was 31.7% in line with our expectations. Backing out extraordinary items, the run rate for the full year was 32.5%. We expect the run rate in 2008 to be about the same, 32.5%. Nick mentioned that free cash flow from operations for the quarter was approximately $900 million that represents 154% of net income from continuing operations for the quarter. Furthermore, that $900 million reflects the reduction for a voluntary contribution of $100 million that was made to our pension plan during the quarter. The strong free cash flow this year put us in a net cash position as Nick mentioned and accordingly, we see next year's net interest expense to be minimal. With respect to share repurchases, we used $505 million last year to repurchase 6.5 million shares at an average price of $77.88. Total backlog grew $300 million in the quarter and $3 billion for the full year. As a result, we ended 2007 with the largest backlog in company history. And my comments were focused on total backlog, because this represents work which is under firm contract with the defiance scope of work. The total estimated contract value which we have reported in our attachments on the other hand includes total backlog plus our options and management's estimates of future awards under IDIQ contracts. So focusing on total backlog, the four segments ended the year with backlog to sales ratios as follows: Aerospace 2.6 times, Combat 1.7 times, Marine 2.4 times and Information Systems and Technology 1 times. I think it's noteworthy that to point out that Marine Systems Group tends to get orders in large drops consistent with large long-term construction projects, particularly submarines and surface combatants. Now consequently, backlog fills up in one year and that steadily depletes over the next several years. That steady run-off is what we are experiencing now in Marine Systems Group. IS&T on the other hand tends to go out and fill their book-of-business each year. This year, the book-to-bill was 1.2 times indicating support for the revenue growth in 2008, that Nick has just outlined for the IS&T Group.  Ray, that concludes my remarks.
Ray Lewis - Staff Vice President of Investor Relations:  Okay. Thank you very much, Hugh. Maria, before we get into the Q&A, I'd like to reiterate that we would like each of you to ask one question, if you want to ask more than one question please then get to backend of the queue, so that we give everyone the opportunity to ask question during the time. Now, Maria, if you would explain to them how they can get into the queue?
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn : Good morning, Nick, Hugh.
Nick Chabraja: Good morning, Rob.
Robert Spingarn : First some general question on Gulfstream, sort of a hybrid question, but if you could give us some more color on what's driving the very impressive backlog growth there book-to-bill? And then, you gave us revenue targets for '08 does that anticipate the same existing unit guidance that you've give before? And if you could also just talk about the margin strength and what's driving that, is it pricing, is it execution?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah, okay, Rob, we'll try and give you some color, I think 58% of the orders in the quarter were international, that is outside of North America, 53% for the year. Let me speak to the year for a minute. Domestic orders were up from 92 in 2006 to 121 in 2007. But the percentage decline from 58% to 47%, so we were faced with robust demand by any reasonable standard in the United States and Canada, an up market for us, but the percentage of orders declined in the face of powerful growth across the rest of the world.  In the fourth quarter, we experienced particularly strong growth in Asia, which was nice to see. The growth I suspect will continue at least through the first quarter, where we've experienced the steady contract activity early in the year and a number of funded memorandum of understanding not yet reduced the contract but of to a good start in the quarter in terms of sales activity.  Margin question, if we compare year-to-year and it differs a little bit for each product, so I'll generalize here. About 50% of the margin growth was attributable to price and basically planed for, most of that was in our plan with a few exceptions because we could get some relatively near-term pricing on mid-size that we couldn't plan for because we weren't a year out at the time. And the other 50% of the margin improvement was through clear productivity gains and the productivity gains had to offset some increase in our purchase material in systems cost. So, if you could see the metrics that I look at, Gulfstream really beat quite handsomely their budget for labor hours on all size aircraft and then really did a bang up job on completion which enabled us to make greater margins on the mid-sized aircraft, so, all-in-all, spectacular performance there.
Robert Spingarn : Any update on the new programs?
Nick Chabraja: No, I don't have anything to say about that, Rob. I think I've announced pretty loudly that we are going to have some major announcements in the year, one of them in the first half. So, I don't want to steal Gulfstream's thunder on that. Those announcements, frankly, are for the benefit of customers and analysts and shareholders should bask in the warmth of additional orders rather than getting the information in advance.
Robert Spingarn : Thanks very much for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Joe Nadol : Thanks. Good morning, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: Good morning, Joe
Joe Nadol : My question is on Gulfstream as well, but it has to do with your guidance. You've given some nice sales growth guidance for Gulfstream, but your margin guidance appears, from my standpoint to be conservative. And certainly you've been conservative during the up-cycle the last few years. What's holding you back from doing a little better considering all the pricing you got in the last 18 months to 2 years? The productivity improvements you're making, what's going on with R&D etcetera?
Nick Chabraja: Well, you know, the pricing is embedded, Joe, I mean, we are going up again and you've got learning curves, it should be starting to flatten. I mean these guys have extracted enormous earning out of their production schedules. So, I don't know that I'd regarded it as conservative or I think its steady improvement, continuous improvement and…
Joe Nadol : Can you share, you broke down very nicely what happened this past year with margin improvement; can you say how those two different factors play into your guidance for 2008 roughly?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah, sure, it's relatively easy. Most of the improvement is on price, which we know and is embedded and we have what would be viewed as normal learning relatively late in a production line, a [material] line. So, if they beat it, it will be a lot of Lean Six Sigma effort that they did this year, but I think doing another 100 basis points it is tough slogging. So, we don't have that embedded.
Joe Nadol : Wasn't there also some operating leveraging that should help you out?
Nick Chabraja: Do they have an opportunity? Yeah, sure they do. They have an opportunity to be better, but I think its Joe the way I look at this isn't a 50-50 plan. I see as much risk in it, as I see opportunity for them, maybe not quite as 50-50 as we have on some of the defense units, because some elements of risk are gone. For example, there will be no question about the volume. The number of planes to be delivered will -- their plan will be precise within one unit probably. The prices are identifiable across the entire product line now, because they are more than year out for every product. And the issue then is the productive question, some variables having to do with pre-owned aircraft sales and what we do over on service side of things. So all in all, I'd probably say here's slightly more opportunity than risk.
Joe Nadol : Okay.
Nick Chabraja: I can run away with the upside on the opportunity.
Joe Nadol : Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr : Yes, Nick. Good quarter.
Nick Chabraja: Thank you, Cai.
Cai von Rumohr : It looks like you delivered one few in large Gulfstream in two few in midsize then your -- I guess most recent guidance. Why the miss and could you give us some color on what you expect for unit deliveries in 2008 out of two models?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah. Cai, yeah, I am going to take it in two parts, first the large and then the small. On the large, in fact, I had guided 80 and we slipped one and delivered 79, the other airplane delivered at 3rd and 4th of January and we could have delivered at the end of the year, we had a willing enable customer, FA certification, but it would have required a fair amount of overtime in the completion centre and we chose efficiency and the customer accommodated us. With respect to the mid-size deliveries, we have a little conundrum here in basic terms, and I will get tricked up every now and then. What I was giving the Street were our production estimates. The delivery estimates and guidance are very similar but they can be off by one or two. We in fact produce the number of mid-sized aircraft that I had indicated but we delivered 59 of them; the other two are in the service as demos. So every now and then I get caught in the switches between production and delivery, but as far as next year is concerned, we plan to produce and deliver same number, 90 of the large cabin aircraft. We plan to deliver 67 mid-size, but we'll probably produce 69 to 70 of them. And again that is the variability between test items or demos which we need in the course of our business. So -- but, we'll deliver 157 aircraft next year, up from 138 this year and that's what's embedded in our revenue guidance to us -- to you.
Cai von Rumohr : But the thing I don't understand, if you are up this 13% or so in terms of units with equivalent mix, how come we're not up more in terms of sales, because isn't the price hike around 4%?
Nick Chabraja: Cai, you can't count on that, because costs go up as well, right? It's the net and we haven't been netting 4%. And your -- in percentage terms, the mix isn't identical. And as I pointed out to you, I am producing more than I am delivering. There's a cost associated with that. In the year, when those two meet perfectly -- I am not trying to trick you here, Cai. We are giving you our honest plan here and the variability that's embedded in it.
Cai von Rumohr : Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Banc of America. Please proceed.
Robert Stallard : Good morning. Nick, there's obviously been some concerns about the impacts of the slowing U.S. economy and possibly a global economy. How do you get comfortable with the [backlog of the economy spends] for Gulfstream as this is a really firm backlog? And how far can you now look out in terms of availability for a new plane today?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah. Rob, obviously, we can't ignore what's going on in the world around us. And what's most apparent in the market that you watch everyday. On the other hand, we are scanning this backlog as a result of that. We started scanning it monthly. We are probably scanning it weekly now. Looking for any infirmity and we can't find any. We have not had a cancellation. And we don't have any customer in discussions with us today for a slip. And we are in discussions with many customer who are in that backlog about opportunities for a move up, which we can't give them other than through increased production. So, we will continue to scan that like a good cyclical will, because that backlog is critical to us. But we have very significant deposits associated with that backlog and particularly closer in for the next several years as we make -- as we move along the production of the green aircraft we get more and more deposits. So, a lot of cash sitting in the bank to support that backlog and so far, backlog holding very, very well and a lot of blue chip customers. So, all makes you feel pretty good. For the moment, the -- and look, a lot of things could go wrong here in the economy and if Gulfstream would still look very, very powerful in '08 and '09, and probably '10 as well. So, it's a long-term view and I believe we'll have ample opportunity to behave like a good cyclical if we encounter a cyclical downturn here. But at the moment, we are pleased with where we are. We are also pleased with our relatively cautious decisions about how we ramped up production. We were under a lot of pressure from both customers and from analysts and shareholders to step up the pace, and I think we protected the business in the long run and have managed that wisely and I give enormous credit to my team down in Savannah, Georgia. They are in good shape and we'll continue to deliver for our shareholders.
Robert Stallard : Great, thanks, Nick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
David Strauss : Thanks, good morning, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: Good morning, David.
David Strauss : You gave us a bit of color in terms of the growth at marine looking even further out in '08. You've also I think talked about potentially $6.5 billion to $7 billion business on 2010 and 2011, is that correct and if so, can you give us a little bit of color, obviously you've got second Virginia-class coming in, but just a little bit color in terms of how you get to those kind of numbers?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah. We really start to see a 2010; we break 6.5 billion in that year. It's a lot of product carrier work continued strength in the T-AKE program and getting the two submarines a year and electric boat and that's the year when we should see the major impact of that. And then another boost again, in 2011, that gets us chasing 7.5 billion not quite getting there.
David Strauss : Okay. So, 2010 you do the math and you are applying close to 20% growth for that business?
Nick Chabraja: In that year that happens.
David Strauss : Okay. 
Nick Chabraja: The year before a little bit more or like between 9% and 10%, 29, but you just going to see it start to ramp, and it will be of all of our businesses unless something happens that and it always going to happen. But in terms of embedded in their operational plans, Marine Systems is the largest grower. 
David Strauss : And on that $6.5 billion in 2010, you're still looking at 10% margins?
Nick Chabraja: I think that's the year they could get there. And I don't know that we have it embedded in our plan, I mean they are not that bold. But you ask me what could you do? People frequently ask me that, particularly by Gulfstream, I mean, a question I always get is, when can you get the 19%? And I'll tell you, not for a while, it's not going to happen for a while. Here, I'm happy to tell you, I think they can get there whether they are bold enough to embed it in their plan there is another story but their plan keeps improving year-over-year in terms of operating margin. And I see opportunity there, they are a little gun-shy about the volume -- they're going to get the volume, they're little gun-shy about embedding what that efficiency can do for them in their plan. But I have a great deal of confidence here that they are going to do the job.
David Strauss : Great, thanks, Nick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Campbell with Lehman Brothers. Please proceed.
Joe Campbell : Good morning, Nick.
Nick Chabraja: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Campbell : I'd like to ask about Combat Systems, the other place besides Gulfstream that really knocked the cover off the ball. And then in your guidance, it's going to have another strong year certainly relatively to overall defense growth. And I wondered if you could just sort of go through the various vehicles in there or the various -- what is it that's driving it? You mentioned that across the board, all the vehicles contributed in 2007. Just give us a little update on how the combat stuff looks in '08? And maybe its sensitivity, if any, to what happens if the up tempo falls off, and then of course presumably there is reset behind that? Thanks.
Nick Chabraja: Joe, we have a very strong tank program, it has many facets. But it is embedded, it's in the backlog, it's well funded. I don't have any concern about it. If anything in our plan we've been a touch cautious about Stryker because there is some further Stryker potential growth in '08 that's in the supplemental, the next supplemental, maybe that's always a gamble, so we don't embed it. MRAP provides us with very nice volume in 2008 more than we had in 2007, and then we don't have it again, I mean, our view is that it goes away, if it doesn't or if more goodness occurs, well that's splendid, that's upside for us. Europe continues to grow. So, the vehicle business and also the export opportunities are significant. They don't quite hit us much in '08, but they begin to hit us in '09, '10 and '11 and they will permit modest continuing growth throughout our planning horizon as the U.S. Army's combat vehicle programs, I think, normalize. So, that's sort of the way we see it. But we are also getting powerful growth out of our ordinance business and out of advanced technology and products, ATP. So, all-in-all I think still a strong business.
Joe Campbell : Thanks very much for the update Nick and then another good year for you guys.
Nick Chabraja: Thank you, Joe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Citigroup. Please proceed.
George Shapiro : Nick, yeah, just pursue a little more detail maybe the MRAP. I mean, I kind of figured that maybe had $500 million sales in '07 and probably goes to maybe $800 million in '08 and then your plan you have it going down to zero in '09. Just to clarify?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah.
George Shapiro : And with the zero in '09 you are still able to see sequential revenue growth between '08 and '09 for the whole sector and if so, what's making up for that $800 million loss?
Nick Chabraja: The amount of growth in other program activity, I mean, it's a very big business today, George. And there is an enormous amount of activity here EFV, JLTV, Stryker growth, tank business, reset business, European sales, export the Saudi program hits us in 2009, two different programs, ammo, strong. So, a lot of growth opportunity here. If anything this is one that I think is a tad conservative in the out years, next year I think is fine.
George Shapiro : Okay. But when you say you are predicting modest growth in '09 and 10 so modestly, I assume is 5% or so?
Nick Chabraja: No, 4ish.
George Shapiro : Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Heidi Wood : Nick, I wanted to ask a question from the international perspective on Gulfstream and Combat. Can you layout for us, in your deliveries in '08 and '09 what is the percentage of deliveries that will be international for Gulfstream and again on that international…
Nick Chabraja: I can't Heidi. I don't have that data. It trails the orders and trails them considerably. So, it will still be less than half, I believe in '08, when that turns I can't tell you.
Heidi Wood : Okay. So, you don't know, whether it is '09 or 2010 when you…
Nick Chabraja: No.
Heidi Wood : Okay. 
Nick Chabraja: No. I don't know.
Heidi Wood : That's fair. Then, on combat, on international, can you talk just about what was the percentage of international content in '07 and then what does that look like '08 and '09 and 2010?
Nick Chabraja: I can't, Heidi you have a sense for that, I really don't.
Redd Hugh: Because you've got the European business and you've got exports both international, plus Canada…
Nick Chabraja: I don't have that data for you, Heidi.
Heidi Wood : Then maybe you can help me, I mean, to me that's, I'm trying to understand the growth in sales you're talking about in the modest margin expectations when it seems to me like the mix of business should be getting better and it seems to me from the orders that you should be getting a lot more international content both non-European as well as European and to me that would be a margin plus, so I'm trying to understand what the offsets are, that….
Nick Chabraja: Yeah, look I think what is probably embedded in our plan is some conservatism about U.S. Army Resources in out-years and we could be wrong with respect to that, and that's why I said earlier, there is probably more upside opportunity in our out-year plan for Combat Systems than we have embedded in it. For example, we don't take Stryker beyond the seventh brigade other than reset opportunities in our plan. I think there is both an eighth brigade opportunity and there are opportunities to use Stryker in other ways. So, if you want to bet that in your forecast, you can do that. We have some very nice pieces of export business, both out of Canada and out of the United States, lined-up, and as we always do with export businesses, we discount those a little bit in our plan because they have a way of slipping to the right overtime and being for a fewer vehicles than initially announced.  As our country struggle with their own budgets, so maybe you could see the detail on our plan, you would see us applying discount factors to well established programs, even where the probability of win for us is almost sole sourced or extremely high, we'll discount the program just on what nature and history tells us things slip and get a little smaller as they go through time but plenty of upside opportunities. 
Heidi Wood : No, absolutely. Good, thanks very much Nick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Steve Binder with Bear Stearns. Please proceed. 
Steve Binder : Yeah, Nick. Can you maybe touch on IS&T, and I know you've said last quarter that you felt the fourth quarter being modestly higher year-over-year in revenue, and obviously it came up a little short. Can you may be touch on where that variance was from?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah. I am not quite sure, Steve, they came up short, I think more on the services side than anywhere else. But I think we look good going forward. I mean, we're seeing the pipeline starting to fill-up. We saw in the quarter some programs that we had under contract go from unfunded to funded. And we saw some IDIQ orders in relatively significant numbers in past quarters were issued and went to funded. So, all of that was an indication to me that the pipeline was getting a little better. And Hugh, do you have some detail on that you could give him?
Hugh Redd: Well, just to your point, the orders under the computing hardware systems, 113 million at the end of the year, and the WIN-T orders of $663 million were significant. 
Nick Chabraja: So, those were the things that went to funded and task orders issued and we're seeing more of that. So, it enabled us to support an organic revenue growth across the sector. That's in the 5% to 6% range next year, and I am pretty comfortable with that.
Steve Binder : I don't mean to be nitpicky but your total backlog grows over $300 million Q3 to Q4, but the IDIQ contract value did decline to $800 million from Q3 to Q4. So, if you look at your table, you provide total estimated contract value it's down $500 million from Q3 to Q4.
Hugh Redd: You know that column that you are referring to is management's best estimate of what their future awards under IDIQ contracts can be and that -- and so, it's subject to management revising competition, and other people who have IDIQ rewards and --
Nick Chabraja: It can be wholesome too, Steve. I mean they can revise. My suspicion is that that $800 million is a combination of two things. Some revised estimates on programs that are very slow to take off. And second, that number goes down when things to the left, when they go into the funded category and we had some particularly good opportunities there this quarter that happened. So, I'm pretty comfortable with that. I am happy to have you arguing the other side of the coin though Steve, because most of you have been outpacing me in your growth estimates for this IS&T group for the last couple of years. I think this is a conservative estimate next year and they can achieve these growth opportunities.
Steve Binder : Okay. And you had a great cash year, I mean 120% of net income and you did get $1 billion of advances in deposits helped out by the strength out of Gulfstream. If you do have some tail off in activity in '08, are you still confident you will be seeing free cash flow equal or better than net income?
Nick Chabraja: I think we are -- our plan provides for me giving you that guidance and I hadn't done it and I think it's equal to not better than. I think equal to is very good, what we have accomplished recently is extraordinary and in part that's been helped by the advanced deposits on aircraft by Gulfstream.
Steve Binder : And one other thing on the Czech, there's been obviously a lot of news reports about the carrier contract with the Czech Government. Do you want to give an update on that and is there any potential earnings impacts from that, considering, I think you still have some inventory there?
Nick Chabraja: I don't think so, Steve. If it is, it's not material. There really is not much to say, we are in the midst of discussions with the Czech Government. They would like to restructure that contract. We would like to restructure it. They probably bit off more than they can chew. We had a couple hundred million probably in revenue forecast for this year. If we don't have it, we'll cover it. It's not significant for us. It's something we are just in the midst of working out with them. So, I don't really know how to comment or want to engage in much speculation. I think my guidance to you considers all possibilities in that area.
Steve Binder : Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel : Thank you very much. Nick, with the cash that you have today there gives you an off a lot of opportunities, how would you sort of -- I mean in the past, you have used some of it to buyback stock. Is that still a reasonably high agenda item?
Nick Chabraja: Howard, I think where that particular item appears on the agenda is directly related to the stock price. I think you have all known, I'm an opportunist and I think you should make your assumptions about our behavior in direct correlation to the opportunity that exists in the stock market. This is a market in full retreat and not necessarily in intelligent retreat. So, you can draw your own conclusions.
Howard Rubel : And then as one follow up, as you've looked at what has been funded in the supplemental and what's yet to be funded, how would you sort of -- how would you handicap your opportunities? You clearly talked about the 8th Stryker Brigade as one opportunity. Is there jump ball things or --?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah, I think, there's some jump balls out there, Howard. I think the first supplemental was largely O&M and everybody who services who might have had their hands out for other kinds of money didn't get that satisfied. And so, we'll either see it in a second supplemental or it will slip into the next year's budget. But we are cautious about the way we handicap these supplementals. We'll work hard with the customer if they want our help to develop their requests. But we'll start to increase our view of things when it happens.
Howard Rubel : I think that's fair. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ronald Epstein : Hey, good afternoon, Nick. On Gulfstream, in terms of their ramp up, I mean how they are going with the supply chain and your suppliers? Are you seeing tightness in any specific areas? Did it -- are you working through it? How is that going?
Nick Chabraja: No, they are actually doing pretty well now. I mean, we have to work that constantly and it was a problem much earlier in the ramp up. The reports I'm getting is that they are doing well. We had isolated issues that we had to work through. And sometimes, it was in the supply chain of our supplier. But I think that the industry, as best I can tell, is doing fairly well in terms of meeting their commitments and they are to us.
Ronald Epstein : Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Gremmels with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.
David Gremmels : Thanks. Good afternoon, Nick and Hugh. You talked about new development activity at Gulfstream and you mentioned it again this morning. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on Gulfstream R&D trends as a percent of sales? Directionally, was it up in '07 and I don't know if you can say anything about '08?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah. It was in fact up and it will be up again, a tad, in '08. It I don't think will be a major driver. It is starting to approach 2% of sales on a net basis. And it moves around quarter to quarter as not because of our spend rate, but because of the cash we receive from our partners and participants in the program as they fund some of our advance research. So, I think its 2% or slightly below but moving steadily towards 2% and that's on a net basis and it's been satisfactory to fund the robust program.
David Gremmels : Okay. And I believe that's higher than it's been in the past, as you look out longer term, do you anticipate that it stays around this 2% number? Is there some room that it could tick back down a bit?
Nick Chabraja: It's going to stay that way forever, if I have anything to say about it.
David Gremmels : Very good. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.
Troy Lahr : Thanks. Just a question on IS&T. You talked about margin pressure next year. Is that just because you had a strong second quarter this year? And then when you say pressure, are you talking maybe 10-20 basis points or could it be more than that and why?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah. I think we are talking about maybe 20-30 basis points and it's a business mix question. We expect the growth in the IT services business where they have lower margins.
Troy Lahr : Okay. So, you are looking at kind of repeating what you did in the fourth quarter. So, fourth quarter is kind of more of a steady run rate for you going into next year, it sounds like, at 10.4%?
Nick Chabraja: I don't know. Yeah, I think that's closer to us.
Troy Lahr : Okay. So, there's no additional margin erosion. Okay. Thanks guys.
Nick Chabraja: And I think I was as explicit as I would care to be about that and I think I have given you, you can do the math, I had given you a 5% to 6% revenue increase and a 3% to 4% bottom line increase organically depending on how we do on the margins. So --
Troy Lahr : No, that's good. It's helpful. Thanks guys.
Nick Chabraja: Yeah, I think we will be as good or better than we were in the fourth quarter and you should always see maybe a 20 basis points of loss in the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned : Good morning. I have a question also on IS&T. When you look at the individual units, could you talk a little bit about AIS and C4 Systems in terms of growth going forward in those two?
Nick Chabraja: C4 Systems has continued to enjoy strong growth, as it did in this year. And it offset what we didn't get in AIS, had some declines. AIS has a very large space segment, both small to midsize satellites and payloads. If you follow, you know where the space program is particularly with respect to new starts and commitments -- new commitments in their segment of the market and even at the larger end, where we are a supplier, the level of activity has been dramatically slow. So, that's why they have been a slow grower. And the IS&T or the Information Technology segment has been slow as you can observe at many other public companies where they do that exclusively. And C4 has been the power and will continue to be a power and its programs have been well funded. They are in very good shape. So, we would look them -- for them to continue to lead. We see IT services getting some traction and starting to have some growth for us. And at AIS, there's not a lot I can say about it, because they draw from classified budgets. But for the moment, their growth is slower than the other segments.
Doug Harned : Okay, and then just separately, can you comment at all on the timeline for the Saudi vehicle contracts? How that's going?
Nick Chabraja: Yeah. I think on the labs, we should see contract activity in the first half of '08. We should see revenues and there are two different contracts. One for the Saudi National Guard, the SANG, and one for the Ministry of Defense and Aviation. They total 724 vehicles for SANG and 120 some -- 124 for the Ministry of Defense. And you should see revenues beginning in '09, but the strength of the program probably in '10, '11 to little bit '12. We should see tank activity, also, maybe an order later this year. And work there probably revenue streams hitting in '10 and '11, some revenue in '09 but stronger in the out years. These are among the programs that are going to provide our out year growth that we were talking about.
Doug Harned : But those are now very much set, is what you're saying. I know this has been a long process. 
Nick Chabraja: I think the program is now well scoped. The requirement is fairly cleanly identified. Size adjusted. We know what our content is. We are in the midst of contract discussions. And I think our level of confidence here is fairly high.
Doug Harned : Okay, great. Thank you.
Ray Lewis: Okay and Maria, I believe we have sort of hit the end of our allotted time here. I would like to remind folks that if any of your colleagues have not heard the entire call, it will be rebroadcast beginning at 1:30 this afternoon. The number is 866-713-8395, the passcode is -- no, I am sorry, that's 888-286-8010. The passcode is 9754127. I am Ray Lewis. My direct line is 703-876-3195. My colleague, Amy Gilliland is at 3427, and after we get a quick good bite to eat, we will be available for any further questions you might have. Thank you very much for being on the call, and good afternoon.

Operator: Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2007 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name is Karma and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions]. Now I would like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Mr. Ray Lewis, Vice President of Investors Relation. Please proceed sir
Ray Lewis - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you very much Karma. I'd like to welcome the members of the investment community as well as the business press we are listening today. I want to remind everyone that there maybe some forward-looking statements made today. These represents our best estimates as to what may occur but are subject of course to the same risks that have always faced any business and I would recommend that anyone who is interested in those risks take a look at our 10-Qs and 10-Ks for a more expansive description of them. With that said I would like to turn things over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nicholas Chabraja.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Ray and good morning. The quarter was pretty straight forward so I think I can be relatively brief and spend more of my time on forward-looking things with you in each of our business segments. In the quarter as is obvious from the press release we had earnings per share of $1.34 which exceeded the analyst consensus by some $0.09 and frankly exceeded our expectations. Earnings per share are up 24.1% over the third quarter of 2006, the increase was a result of strong revenue growth coupled with marked improvement margins. By the way this is the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per share on a quarter-over-prior-year-quarter basis, something I think we are pretty proud of. Our revenue in the quarter was up 12.6% year-over-year to $6.8 billion and operating margin increased 50 basis points to 11.7% and frankly the strongest margins in my memory. Free cash flow from continuing operations was 152% on net income, which put us over a 100% year-to-date. So very good conversion in the quarter and for the year. I think in brief the quarter was excellent, in almost all respects from my point of view. Now let me spend a few minutes discussing the performance in each of the segments what we expect from each of them in the fourth quarter and then take your questions. And I think Hugh has a couple of points to make as well. Aerospace, Gulfstream, they continue to perform beautifully. Revenue exceeded $1.3 billion on volume growth across all of our models, including... I am pleased to report the G150 which is gaining considerable traction in the marketplace. We are very pleased with that product introduction. Total revenue from Gulfstream is up 21% year-over-year and 10% over the second quarter this year, last quarter. Margins improved 200 basis points largely from productivity improvements and in part from favorable pricing. As a result of revenue growth and margin improvement, operating earnings grew to $226 million, a 37% increase year-over-year. In addition to current excellent performance, Gulfstream orders continue at a strong pace resulting in a dollar denominated book-to-bill ratio of 1.67 to 1 for the quarter, so one in two-thirds to one. Gulfstream obviously had a great quarter, but I don't anticipate that the 17.2% margin rate will be repeated in the fourth quarter. I expect fourth quarter sales and earning to come in between the second and third quarter results. In other words we expect the fourth quarter to be stronger than the second quarter, but not quiet as strong as the third. Turning my attention now to Combat Systems, their revenues increased 37% year-over-year to almost $1.9 billion. Additionally Combat Systems improved margins 20 basis points year-over-year generating operating earnings of $228 million. That represents a 39% increase in earning year-over-year. Order intake during the period was strong, resulting in a $700 million increase in total backlog for the group. For the fourth quarter, I expect revenue to increase significantly, but margins will be back down in the mid 11% range. Not withstanding the reduced margins, I expect a significant increase in operating earnings on the strength of really quite a significant increased volume. You might recall that earlier in the year we have been forecasting a 40 to 50 basis point improvement in margins for the Combat Systems Group. As the year went by we changed that guidance to 10 to 20 basis points. I think it's now fair to forecast that the year-over-year improvement will be on the high side on the 20 basis point mark, which will give us a very nice operating earnings increase given the very, very strong increase in revenue that we are experiencing. Our Marine Systems Group, revenue grew a modest 2% over the same quarter last year, but I am pleased with the 8% growth in earnings. As you may recall, the third quarter of 2006 margins was 8.4% which was very good last year and that included the favorable conclusion of the BP tanker program, which added one time $11 million positive to earnings. This quarter the margins were 40 basis points higher yet at 8.8%. Operating earnings were $110 million and backlog grew during the quarter albeit modestly. All-in-all, another very solid performance in our Marine segment. They've now had two back-to-back quarters with 8.8% margins, and I expect them to end the year with a good quarter although at reduced margins. For the year we expect overall margins in this group to be between 8.2% and 8.4%, which is better than we started out the year anticipating, we were thinking about 8.1%, I think I'd given you that number repeatedly. If they make it to... and we've had a few items hanging fire here and that's why I give you a little bit of a range, but if they make it to 8.4% for the year that implies that the fourth quarter number will have an 8 in front of it, which would... I would find very satisfying. IS&T. third quarter revenue in the IS&T group was essentially flat although organic growth in the North American market was above 3% relative to the third quarter 2006. I had told you previously that we expect that IS&T margins to compress about 50 basis points for the full year against last year as a result of the acquisitions we've made last year. However, margins were only 20 basis points lower in the third quarter and only 10 basis points lower year-to-date. So from a margin perspective IS&T is doing a better job than we had guided you, and they generated operating earnings in the quarter of an impressive $254 million. We continue to have a favorable view of this business, and are pleased that orders exceeded sales this quarter resulting in backlog growth. Although volume will be up in the fourth quarter, I think margins will compress further and dampen the effect of the top-line growth. Backlog, overall, with respect to backlog, I should point out that during the quarter total backlog increased at each of the four segments for a total of $46.5 billion. About 80% of our total backlog is fully funded. With respect to cash I'll make a quick comment and then conclude, with a remark or two on guidance for the year. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $826 million and I told you earlier that represents 152% of net income from continuing operations in the quarter, and year-to-date cash flow is running closer to 106% of net income. As is apparent in the press release, we are raising our guidance for the year to a range $5 to $5.05 per share. I should also indicate that free cash from continuing operations will exceed the net income rather nicely which is also, above the way I have been guiding you throughout the year, where I told you that it would be the equivalent of net income. In conclusion let me say that I am very pleased with our company's performance this quarter. It was a great quarter. But Hugh you have a couple of additional points to make. So, this is Hugh Redd our CFO.
L. Hugh Redd - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Nick. I want to address the effective tax-rate first. The effective tax-rate for the quarter was 31.2% which is 50 basis points lower than the same period last year. This rate is also slightly lower than our expectations for either the fourth quarter of 2007 or the full year. So lapse in any significant discreet events we anticipate the fourth quarter rate to be closer to 32% and that would result in the full year tax-rate being closer to 31.5%. As Nick mentioned, free cash flow from continuing operations was $826 million which represents 152% of net income and year-to-date free cash flow approximates 106% of the net-income. During the quarter strong cash flow reduced net debt from $1 billion to $500 million and obviously that lower net debt resulted in lower interest expense for the quarter. Finally during the quarter, we repurchased slightly more than 4 million shares of common stock at an average price of $77.73. Now this brings the year-to-date total to just over $6 million shares at an average price of $77.15. And these repurchase activities were consistent with our activity and our behavior in the past. We'll buy back shares opportunistically when market conditions permit. That concludes my remarks, Ray.
Ray Lewis - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you very much Hugh. Karma we're ready to begin the Q&A session. I'd like to remind everyone that we would prefer each questioner to make one question, and if you want to bring up another subject, get to the back of the queue, this way we can give everyone a chance to ask question during this session. And with that said Karma could you explain the folks how they can get into the queue? Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Citigroup. Please proceed.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Good morning Nick.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning George.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Usual question to look at. IS&T you mentioned 3% organic growth in North America. Do we start to see that in Q4 as the Bowman contract is kind of down?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think you are going to see it in Q4, George, as a result of a little more volume as I indicated in my remarks. We expected increased volume in the fourth quarter let me see if I can find that for you; maybe another $150 million to $160 million of revenue, so you'll see a little more growth here.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: And do we get more organic growth next year in this business?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Look, it's always hard to predict that what is that that we're seeing out there, the order book would suggest that we're going to have organic growth. Whether funds get released to fund the contract but it is another story so, let me just say I am guardedly optimistic about that.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Joe Campbell from Lehman brothers. Please proceed.
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: Yes, good morning it's actually Carter Copeland, good quarter Nick.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Carter.
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: Quick question. I wonder if we could just talk really briefly about marine, I was surprised to see the margins come in at 88 again, you had said that the... you had concluded some... expecting to conclude some FSGN [ph] work and we're expecting the margins to come down a bit there this quarter. What was it that... that occurred to make them a little bit higher than you expected?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We have really strong performance at Electric Boat in the quarter that I wasn't counting on. I think it was as a result of efficiencies in the Virginia-class program and some repair volume where they did well, so...
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: Are those one time in nature or is this sort of... for this sort of performance we... can we count some of this going forward?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I can say that the productivity improvements in Virginia are one time nature, but repair volume for us is spotty and I don't expect the recurrence in the fourth quarter, and that's why I indicated that we should be looking in the fourth quarter to... for some compression of the margins we've enjoyed in the first two quarters. But still it will be good. And I'm hopeful that it has an eight in front of it.
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: Do you have any sort of update... and also in Marine do you have any sort of update on LCF?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't think there is anything to say about that one.
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: Fair enough, thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steve Binder from Bear Stearns.
Steve Binder - Bear Sterns: Yes, good morning. I am just wondering, the company-sponsored R&D was $13 million from year-ago and $15 million from the second quarter. Is it fair to say that is that pretty much all Gulfstream Nick?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't have any idea.
Steve Binder - Bear Sterns: You'veno idea, okay.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I haven't parsed the company-sponsored R&D accounts in a way that would be sufficient for me to give you a detailed response.
Steve Binder - Bear Sterns: Because assuming... I guess, I was going to say assuming it was, a chunk of it or at least an increase, it seems like the incremental margins year-over-year were certainly better than they were they were in Q2, even they worked better than in Q2, even if you factor out any change R&D. And is that just more favorable mix or if you backup pre-owned sales...
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I can't... I am not at that level of weeds for you Steve.
Steve Binder - Bear Sterns: All right. With respect... and then with respect to, this one you could probably answer, you're more aggressive in your share repurchase program obviously than the third quarter. It looks like for the full year so far just annualize your dividend where you aren't share purchase; it looks like you are going to return at least half of your free cash flow to shareholders and which is probably the most... your largest percentage we have seen since 98. I am just wondering, now what's your attitude on share repurchase these days? I know you are opportunistic but the stock kind of averaged in Q3 where it was in Q2. Do you think you are going to... are you looking to be given an improving balance sheet more aggressive now than you might have been in the first half?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Steve I thought the market made a mistake in the third quarter and I took advantage of it. Our prospects in the third quarter were better than they were in the second quarter, we announced very strong earnings and we improved our guidance for the year. The stock initially responded to that, it was a hick up that we all know about the market that I didn't believe, and I bought the stock aggressively.
Steve Binder - Bear Sterns: All right.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: When it returned to its appropriate level, we backed away. I think we... and I expect that to happen every now and then and when it happens, we'll be all over it.
Steve Binder - Bear Sterns: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Good morning Nick.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Rob.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Going over to aerospace if you could just give us a little bit more color perhaps on the fourth quarter comment you made earlier about the numbers dropping to sort of between that... between the 2Q and 3Q figures on sales and margins and perhaps you can update us on where you are with your latest aircraft development, what we can expect in terms of news there and ramp.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think in terms of margin... I mean in terms of volume difference, it's insignificant and it has principally to do with pre-owned activity and whether or not we deliver a plane or not at the end of the year, and I would say on the... with respect to margin we just had an unusually good quarter. And one of the things I should point out to you, this is mix sensitive and we didn't deliver any 500s in the quarter or any 350s, which are of the large aircrafts, our lower margin airplanes. So we had exceedingly good mix. And we did reasonably well on pricing of the light or the mid-sized aircraft. But our forecast, I think, is perfectly clear that our margins won't be strong in... as strong in the fourth quarter, but still very good when compared to a year ago, and still leaving us well ahead of our plan in our earlier guidance to you and I feel particularly good that when we look at it as compared to our plan and as compared to a year ago about 80% of the improvement is not from pricing, its from performance, productivity that leaves us nicely positioned to continue to improve as time goes by.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: And then on the new aircraft front?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We will make an announcement when we make an announcement.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question come in a line is Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Good morning Nick.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Heidi.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Can you give us greater granularity on the margins at our Combat Systems and talk about the percentage of international at the Combat systems year-to-date in 07 and remind us what it was in 06?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The... if I remember correctly Heidi, we anticipate that the growth in our European land systems business will be about 20% year-over-year. The remainder of the growth will come out of North American operations.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Alright. The... I want to go back to the aeronautics for a second, the G150 can talk about pricing there and the bottom end of the market we are seeing an increased number of players, is that effecting pricing for you?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Our pricing is strengthening as that, airplane... you had seen in the market in the introductory pricing is over. I think, I am surprised that how well it's taken off, how many orders we had in the quarter, and it's going to be a good airplane for us and it's... pricing is up considerably over its introductory price.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: All right, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Well thank you very much, a couple of things. First Nick you talked about, productivity being an important part of the results and I would think that... and you kind of indicate us a bit on the... you were surprised or pleased. So does that set you... set the stage fro you being able to ship more aircraft next year than you originally had expected giving how late you are in this year?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, look Howard, what I think of, where I think we are is we will do 82 of the large aircraft this year which is right in accordance with the plan, and, it could be one more or one less, depending on the vagaries of...
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Customers and yes.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. And next year as I'd once said, we were planning to do 83, we've upped that to 88. And it looks to me like in the following year we will go over 90, maybe as many as 92 or 93 and that is all as a result of productivity gains. And it is enabling increase in volume as well as improving margins. So yes, to your question, Howard, you are right on the money.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: And then... thank you. And then just on... MRAP has been on the fastest tail imaginable and while I know that's only a modest part of your business, could you talk about how you have dealt with getting up to speed so fast; I think you are ahead of schedule there and what you've done in the supply chain to make it happen and does that translate anywhere else in the Combat System's area?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: MRAP, we've had more volume this year than we anticipated. I think I was telling people $300 million to $400 million, now it looks $100 million to $500 million, I can't get it with a fine-toothed comb but in fact we're pleased that we're building out what we have for our customer more rapidly than the schedule they have given us and that's with respect to both products, RG-31 and the Cougar. I think we've had a lot of cooperation in the supply chain and have good partners, and we have a lot of capacity in our facilities that we've managed to bring to bare on that whole supply chain management and the production problem. So for us this is a very nice thing. We very much appreciate the order we received recently and MRAP II together with our partner, Force Protection, for our joint venture, Forced Dynamics, and look forward to having a good year in 2008 with MRAP.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Thank you. I'll let it go there.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Joseph Nadol III - J.P. Morgan Securities: Thank, good morning Nick. I'd like to ask about follow-up in the balance sheet. You have paid down almost all your debt at least on a net debt basis. Buying back more stock but you are still looking at it optimistically. I am wondering if you are sort of looking a little harder for acquisitions than maybe you had. But I am wondering also even more importantly if the pricing environment has gotten more favorable since the credit crunch?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Joe you correctly identified the fact that probably by the end of the year be at zero net debt or thereabouts. So we have a powerful balance sheet. We are always looking hard at acquisitions. This is a company that was built through acquisition. So we are always looking. Pricing, I don't know, pricing is such an individual thing; it depends on how badly somebody wants a business, who all is in there competing for it, and how it fits them. So I don't know whether pricing is better or worse. There have been a couple of prices announced in the marketplace that caused me catch my breath, but transactions I won't mention. But I think it's catch or miss. I don't know that there is a trend yet that I can identify.
Joseph Nadol III - J.P. Morgan Securities: If nothing would have happened would you be comfortable going relatively indefinitely with a net cash positive balance sheet or detailed pressure on sort of maximizing your... the opportunities from your balance sheet?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We are going to maximize opportunities over time, Joe. I don't feel any particular pressure I get a lot of questions, but that's okay, it's a rich problem they have, and I understand the need to deploy the capital and we in fact will overtime.
Joseph Nadol III - J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Citigroup. Please proceed.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Hi Nick, just a follow up. Along the big growth in Combat, was the bulk of that growth in the quarter than from the MRAP program and then that would... I would think would be higher in the fourth quarter which is kind of what you are alluding to and having significantly higher growth in the fourth quarter.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Not true George. We grew across the product line... the tanks; the tank line might strike you as a strange one. But it is... was the second largest growth product in the quarter. Stryker... and between Stryker and the tank they were considerably larger than MRAP, but MRAP was obviously a plus. We had good increases in soldier protection systems namely Chameleon. Our munitions were up significantly even absent the effect of an... the acquisition of SNC. And Europe was up significantly and in Europe that's four products: Piranha, Pandur, the Eagle, and the Duro, slightly offset by some reduction in Leopard sales to the Spanish government. So it was pretty much across the product line. The largest item was MRAP, but not... it was just spare change between MRAP soldier protection systems, tanks and Strykers. So pretty strong all the way across the board.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Okay and when you said you would be way up in the forth quarter, I mean the fourth quarter is always a seasonally strong quarter with a European business.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. And that will be a lot of European sales, but on the other hand the land systems will up... way up on units of delivery. Each one of the businesses is going to up significantly in volume and the volume growth be in the magnitude of $700 million over this quarter give or take a little bit.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Okay.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Binded between $650 million and $750 million. I can't be that fine because it's units of delivery. But if we said $700 million on an average I think we would be pretty close, couple that with reduced margins. And you have a pretty good handle on it.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: And then you expect continued strong growth next year, I mean you are going to get closer to the 20% more growth next year?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: George I don't know yet. We won't make a call on that until we have... after we got through our budget cycle. There are lot of moving parts right now, in the army, discussions with the congress in the supplemental. So I want to do what I have done in the past and that is get through our own budget cycle which will end by mid November, and then look for an opportunity to make a forecast for next year. Most of the time I have waited until the first quarter... I mean the fourth quarter's earning announcement, so mid January. But occasionally there will be an investor conference somewhere in the year and if that gives me the opportunity, I will do it then. But I think I couldn't give you a good forecast right now. We are going to have a good year next year in Combat Systems but the question is how good. And God I have been desperately wrong. I mean one year I predicted the 22% growth, we got 12 and next year I predicted 12, we got 20. So I see that this is not a good game to play until I have a little more information.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Well you always attributed that jumping around more to the European business than the North American business?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, but the North American business is obviously right now extremely dynamic. And there are programs moving around, a lot of issues out there, you got a eight striker brigade in some of the marks in the congress, is that going to happen or isn't it going happen, you have got some interesting plans. People discussing about strikers, you have got MRAP, you've got JLTV, you've got EFV. I have got a lot of moving parts here and to predict how all that's going to come out without seeing this bill, come out of the congress, both the appropriation and the authorizers bill, I think is foolhardy, I don't think there's... I have ever seen a time when there has been more money in play, and the delta on some of these programs is pronounced, as it is this year and the supplemental opportunities, and risks. So I think this year its more North America than Europe. Europe for next year is reasonably predictable because they have a very, very handsome backlog and are working now to deliver in Portugal and Czechoslovakia, Spain, so very good situation Europe, that's piece that I could predict continued growth on but North America is up in the air.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Okay, thanks very much Nick.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning Nick.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Ronald.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Going back to aerospace just for a minute, what percentage of the activity this last quarter was international?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Let's talk about orders first is that best way I think to measure the demand in the... 53% of our orders for outside of North America, 47% in year-to-date, 51% of the orders are what you call international, not from North America, and 49% North America. So increasing the trend to more of a north... export order book. On a delivery side, the numbers look just about flipped. We're still delivering 53%, 54% of our product into North America.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Okay, and just if you could... I don't know if you have a feel for this or not, but how sustainable a trend do you think that is going to be?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I really don't know the answer to that, these are obviously emerging markets, they're taking advantage of strong economies and growth in the economies in certain countries taking advantage of a rather handsome exchange rate. I can tell you however we think and not of these markets that we are moving out very fast to strengthen our support in these areas for our customers though this is a double blessing in some ways. Our service business is increasing to match the sale activity. Our service business this year is going to have a very, very handsome increase in revenue and margin. It's getting to be a business well north of $600 million for this year, and I expect continued growth next year.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Gremmels from Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.
David Gremmels - Thomas Weisel Partners: Yes, thanks good morning. On IS&T, it does seem like the revenue recoveries have been delayed a bit from what we are originally expecting and I am wondering if that is to any extent high to what you have been talking about in terms of the dynamic budget environment, is IT funding being diverted to support war fighting and is there any risk with the delayed passage of the budget that that could hit some of the IT services businesses?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't know. I think this is a very large business now. It's over $10 billion. It has experienced very rapid growth till we got to this year. Things don't grow rapidly and definitely and they pick up again as I would say that the current emphasis on spending and the priority is given to those things that can be introduced immediately for the war fighter. There are very current requirements. So we've seen some slowdown in some of the networking activity although recently picked up again and some of the IT services activity. But these things tend to be cyclical and I don't think it's anything we're particularly disturbed about. But the positive indicators are the order book and activity, the program activity, the negative I would say is the rated which funds are being released to support those programs.
David Gremmels - Thomas Weisel Partners: Thanks, and if I could just squeeze a Gulfstream question in as well. Orders obviously have stayed very strong in the third quarter but I am wondering as we get deeper into Q4 and you are talking to customers, are you seeing any evidence at all of a slowdown given some of the broader market uncertainties that have been causing some worries lately?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Nothing on toward there David. We continue to take contracts in the fourth quarter. And LOIs, we expect we will have a very good quarter from an order perspective in the fourth, that is it will be in my view equal to or exceed our billing rates, the book to bill will be one or slightly better. And I've said for a long time we could do with a little easing of demand here. It is far outstripping our capacity to service it in an efficient way. For example, a 550 customer... a new 550 customer that would enter into serious discussions today, would be looking at the second or third quarter of 2011 for entry into service of their aircraft. And a 450 buyer would be looking at the third quarter of 2010. Those are relatively extended times for delivery of new aircraft to a new customer. I would expect that alone to temper some of the order rate, but we continue to do very well, the pipeline remains strong. So I don't have yet any indication of what you were asking me.
David Gremmels - Thomas Weisel Partners: And last one, you commented on your large cabin production plans, wondering if you'd be willing to share your plan for the mid-size jets?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes that's a little more variable but I don't remember those off hand but let me take a look and see if I can tell you. I can't lay hands on it. But the production rates are going up on both.
David Gremmels - Thomas Weisel Partners: Thanks very much.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Wait a minute, wait a minute; I might just have a piece of paper. Yes, we did 42 of the mid-sized a year ago, and we will do 61 more or less this year and 68 next year. So, if you want to think about it this way, think about going total, from 143 aircraft deliveries in 2007 to 156, about a 9% increase. But a greater portion of the increase is in the mid-size.
David Gremmels - Thomas Weisel Partners: Thanks Nick.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from CIBC World Markets. Please proceed.
Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets: Thanks, good morning.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Myles.
Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets: A question for you, you brought up the spares and maintenance sales and you've mentioned year-to-date don't look quite strong, I am just wondering Nick could you put it in kind of buckets of what's driving that whether it's the service facility expansion, some coming of warranty, are you actually capturing greater percentage of your fleet?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think that it's all of the above, except capturing a greater percentage of the fleet. It's hard to imagine that we could have a greater percentage, but what you have is more airplanes and service, more coming off of warranty that are still vital airplanes to the service. The expansion of our facility has been a great enabler. And our outreach out of the United States, of all of those things contribute to a rapidly growing service business and improving margins. So we are looking forward to continuing that.
Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets: And you mentioned that the profitability there improving, is it still between large cabin and mid-size in terms of gross margin profitability?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Within the service sector?
Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets: Yes.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I can't tell you that Myles, I don't know for sure.
Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets: Okay.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But I wouldn't think so.
Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets: Would it be higher or lower?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I would... I am guessing that it's the same.
Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets: Okay.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You are using the same labor rates and...
Ray Lewis - Vice President, Investor Relations: Myles its Ray Lewis. It can bounce around from quarter-to-quarter depending on mix considerably as I tell people sometimes that my dad was a car dealer and we've change oil for some under the low margin, so we get their transmission work when they were ready for that. And so it can move about but it's...
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It would depend in a particular quarter whether you have any refurbs or high-margin opportunities and you get those on G200s just the way you do on 4s and 5s. But, I think on balance the service opportunity and margin opportunity for all the planes is similar.
Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets: Great, thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks an awful lot. Nick could you provide some color on kind of the tone demand... you said you expect book to bill to be greater than one, but where are you getting the better price hikes and is there any opportunity to kind of switch some folks out like some folks who may be over 550 near end, will kind of give that slot up and you can move a better price plane forward?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Cai not really. The backlog has had very little activity in it. That is I hear occasionally that some people have traded their spot to someone else, but that's not apparent to us, it's not clear that that's happened. But most of our... in fact all of our customers have just flung right in there. We've had very few cancellations in the year I think one that was one in the first quarter but we had none in the second or third. And so I don't know that I can make anything of all of that Cai.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: And could you comment a little bit on relative pricing, I think, out of MBAA folks got the impression that the larger long range planes were the ones that were... where the pricing was the strongest is that... can you, which of the models were...
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think we've enjoyed price improvement across our models and probably the one that's improved the most is unique right it's the 150 and it's gone from an introductory price to what is now probably a mature price. So in percentage terms it may have grown the most rapidly. But the 550 is enjoying a very, very strong price environment.
Ray Lewis - Vice President, Investor Relations: And Karma if we could take two more questions and then I think we'll be wrapping things up.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Please proceed.
David Strauss - UBS: Good morning Nick.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Dave.
David Strauss - UBS: Could you talk about the performance at the European Land Systems business. I think you've changed the management out there, you are talking about margins in the fourth quarter being low I know that business has lower the margin. But just how is that business performing relative to your expectations?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's performing very well and still not at the level of our [indiscernible] American operations but we've made a significant improvement there and we've taken some charges as you know in earlier quarters on our commercial trading business. That's part of the reason that Combat Systems Group is only going to be say 20 basis points better than a year ago to the full year. But they've have made marked improvement quarter-over-quarter and the fourth quarter will be their strongest. And in the fourth quarter they will be our margin rate leader. So, they have come a long way for the year. For the full year they will have lowest margin rate of anybody in the group, but in the fourth quarter they will in fact be the margin rate leader if things play out the way we think they are going to play out. So we counting on them to do a big job in the fourth quarter.
David Strauss - UBS: Great that's great color. You kind of talked about what's in front of congress on the armor vehicle side as they kind of finalize the 08 budget. Could you talk about maybe from the ship building side? I know in conference they are looking at potentially accelerating multi-year procurement for Virginia class. What do you kind of see as the big issues in conference on the Navy side?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't know about from the Navy's perspective, I can tell you from my perspective.
David Strauss - UBS: Sure.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Submarine, submarine, submarine, submarine, one, two, three, four. That is the issue. We are also interested in T-AKEs and support of the DDG 1000. I suppose the LCS at some level is important to us. But our number one priority as I have been saying for four or five years now is to get the two submarines here and there's enough activity in front of all four committees, the authorizers in both the senate and the house and good language in the bills and the appropriators that I think, there is a fair opportunity that we are going to get the multi-year procurement and strong support for the Submarine. That is the key I think to the continued prosperity of the Marine group and growth again in growth in revenue and in margins overtime.
David Strauss - UBS: And just one last one is getting that potentially a year earlier than you might have thought, what impact might that have on the Marine business?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well it will start to grow earlier. There will be advanced procurement much sooner and so you will have additional volume and additional margin opportunities. Much sooner it will be... it will fit into our planning... our current planning horizon and you will get a more robust plan out of us for Marine System growth for the next three, four years.
David Strauss - UBS: Okay, great. Thanks a lot Nick.
Operator: And the final question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Banc of America. Please proceed.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: Good afternoon.
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: Nick just a big picture question. Your Combat System division has clearly done well from the current military activities. If the U.S. forces were to start coming back from Iraq next year, what do you think the likely impact would be on General Dynamics?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think that there will be a lot of impact. I just listened to Secretary of Defense, Gates, talk a week or two ago to the annual convention of the Association of the United States Army and their trade show, and he made about four points about the army budget. He said, first he expects persistent conflict around the world, as far as his eye can see. Second, he believes that the army was under-funded going into Iraq, and that that cannot continue as a mater of share of the budget. Third he said, the army and the Marine Corps must reset, and they can't reset for the past, they have to reset for the future. And he made a fourth point, yes... the fourth point was, it's very vital for the army and the Marine Corps to proceed with their modernization or transformation programs with a look towards the future. I think for all of those reasons, our Combat Systems business remains vital to the security of this country, and our aspirations as a world power. So I don't think that the end of the conflict of having negative economic impact on us. It will certainly change the mix of our work, but we have a lot of things going here in the near term.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And just to wrap things up, it was mentioned earlier you have got a very strong balance sheet at the moment. How has your pipeline for M&A changed over the last quarter?
Nicholas D. Chabraja - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: People always talk about pipelines. That's a word that's sort of foreign to me. I think it's a word that probably has common parlance for venture capitalists where they work on a portfolio of transactions. I kind of take them one at a time. And look, there's activity out there... there's companies out there that want to be sold and we are always looking.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Ray Lewis - Vice President, Investor Relations: And I want to thank everyone for joining us today, I know you have other calls you need to listen to. So we want wrap this up. My name is Ray Lewis, I am Staff Vice President of Investors Relation. After a quick bite, I will take your question. If you'd like my number is 703- 876-3195 and a very able associate Amy Gilliland who also will be taking questions at 703-876-3748. And again thank you for being with us today and goodbye.
Operator: This concludes your presentation for today. Ladies and gentleman you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful week.
