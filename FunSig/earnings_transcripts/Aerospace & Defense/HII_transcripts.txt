===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the First Quarter 2025 HII Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Christie Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mrs. Thomas, you may begin.
Christie Thomas: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the HII first quarter 2025 conference call. Matters discussed on today's call that constitute forward-looking statements, including our estimates regarding the company's outlook, involve risks and uncertainties and reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. These risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at ir.hii.com. On the call today are Chris Kastner, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I'll start by providing an update on our 2025 operational initiatives, which include enhancing shipbuilding throughput, reducing costs, and securing new contract awards. In the first quarter, we made progress against our goal of improving shipbuilding throughput by 20% year-over-year. Ingalls is largely on plan and their production milestones remain unchanged. Newport News is modestly behind plan. Half of this variance is driven by the atypical weather we experienced in January and February. The most significant variance in Newport News resides with CVN 80. This is directly related to the late major equipment that is to be installed in the whole of the ship. These delays directly impact the construction approach and have limited the progress we can make on the ship. Once this equipment is received from our suppliers, which is scheduled throughout the summer, we anticipate an acceleration of progress. Additionally, for both shipyards, our outsourcing efforts continue, and we expect this to ramp throughout the year to support our throughput goals. Our South Carolina production facility is online and has already completed the first carrier unit for Newport News. The team remains focused on meeting our delivery schedules and is working with the Navy to identify additional initiatives that will accelerate scheduled performance. Turning to our cost reduction efforts. Plans are in place, and we intend to reach our goal of $250 million in annualized cost reduction by year's end. We have an agreement on the Block V FY 2024 II Built contract, and we will now turn our focus to the Block VI and Columbia Build II contracts. Also, I want to highlight how our strategic focus in 2025 aligns nicely with the administration's defense priorities. On April 9th, the Trump administration released two executive orders, modernizing defense acquisitions and spurring innovation in the defense industrial base and restoring America's maritime dominance. We are working with our customers on strengthening the industrial base and accelerating the transition of new capabilities to the warfighter. We are leaning into the use of other transaction authorities and are working with the Rapid Capabilities Office as a means to leverage new technologies. For example, in April, we delivered the first two Lionfish small uncrewed undersea vehicles to the U.S. Navy under a program that could scale to 200 vehicles. The program was developed in partnership with the U.S. Navy and Defense Innovation Unit to accelerate adoption of dual-use commercial technologies into U.S. Department of Defense programs. This quarter, we also announced that our Mission Technologies division was selected to develop an open architecture high-energy laser counter-drone system for the U.S. Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies office. HII will develop and test a high-energy laser prototype to acquire, track and destroy small-to-medium-sized unmanned aircraft systems. On the shipbuilding side of the business, we established an MOU with HD Hyundai Heavy Industries. The MOU provides a framework for us to jointly explore opportunities to collaborate, on accelerating ship production in support of defense and commercial shipbuilding projects. Like our existing strategic relationship with U.K.-based Babcock International, we believe international partnerships are crucial to strengthening the Allied industrial base. Given our core business, these strategic relationships position us to support initiatives that may result from the Maritime executive order. Turning to the results, first quarter revenue was $2.7 billion and earnings, per share was $3.79. We ended the first quarter with backlog of $48 billion, of which approximately $28 billion is currently funded. Now let me share a few first quarter highlights. During the quarter, at Ingalls Shipbuilding, we launched DDG 129, Jeremiah Denton, christened LPD 30, Harrisburg and started fabrication of LPD 32 Philadelphia. At Newport News, CVN 79, Kennedy continued catapult testing and achieved 95% of compartments turned over to the Navy. And on the Virginia-class program, we completed a major test event on the first boat of Block V, SSN 802 Oklahoma. Also at our recently acquired Newport News Charleston operations, we retained 99% of the transitioning workforce, and these new shipbuilding team members are working on submarine and carrier units, to help increase throughput at Newport News. We also celebrated the graduation of 115 apprentices during the Apprentice School graduations at both shipyards. These graduates started the apprentice program during COVID, and we look forward to higher numbers of graduates in upcoming years, following the expanded enrollment we've recently experienced. Turning to Mission Technologies, in addition to delivering the initial line five small UUVs I mentioned earlier, we surpassed 700 Remus Uncrewed underwater vehicles sold and delivered to 30 countries. Key wins at Mission Technologies in the quarter, in addition to the high-energy laser weapon system included a contract to expand shipboard and shore-based training support for the U.S. Navy and Coalition Forces, a pilot training contract to support the nation's combat-Ready force, an award from the U.S. Air Force to protect systems and software and a task order to support global air and space operations. Turning to activities in Washington for a moment, while a full year continuing resolution for defense is unprecedented, we are pleased with the support provided for our shipbuilding programs, which supports our target of achieving more than $50 billion in awards across 2025 and 2026. The Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act 2025 included funding for 3 Arleigh Burke-class surface combatants, one Virginia-class submarine, one San Antonio-class amphibious ship and the RCOH for CVN-75. I'll note that we do not expect a material impact related to tariffs. We purchased the vast majority of our material domestically. We have long-term purchase agreements in place for material that may be impacted by tariffs. In summary, I'm encouraged by the results to-date and the progress our team has made against the operational initiatives we've laid out. But I also know there is significant work to be done as we continue to execute for our customers and create value for our shareholders. Our outlook is unchanged. And over the next few years, as we execute on the pre-COVID contracts and transition into the post-COVID contracts, we will continue to reduce risk and align our portfolio baselines with the current environment. I fully expect top line growth with a forecast of $15 billion of revenue by 2030 as well as margin and free cash flow normalization in the years ahead. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financial performance. Tom?
Tom Stiehle : Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Let me start by briefly discussing our first quarter results, and then I will address our reaffirmed outlook for the year. For more detail, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 5 of the presentation. Our first quarter revenues of approximately $2.7 billion decreased 2.5% compared to the same period last year. This decreased revenue was attributable to declines at Newport News Shipbuilding, Ingalls Shipbuilding and Mission Technologies. Ingalls revenues of $637 million decreased by 2.7% compared to the first quarter of 2024, driven primarily by lower volume on amphibious assaults ships. Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion decreased by 2.6% compared to the first quarter of 2024, driven primarily by lower volumes in aircraft carriers and naval nuclear support services, partially offset by higher volumes in the Columbia-class submarine program. Mission Technology revenues of $735 million decreased by 2% compared to the first quarter of 2024 driven primarily by lower volume in C5ISR. Results for the quarter exceeded our guidance. The year-over-year decline was expected and related to nonrecurring sales in the first quarter of 2024. Moving on to Slide 6. Segment operating income of $171 million in the first quarter of 2025 increased less than 1% compared to the first quarter of 2024, driven by improved performance at Mission Technologies in cyber, electronic warfare and space and Uncrewed Systems, which was largely offset by lower amphibious assault ship risk retirements at Ingalls. At Newport News, segment operating income improved by $3 million, or 3.7% compared to the first quarter of 2024. Results in the quarter included unfavorable performance-related adjustments for CVN-80 Enterprise as well as Block IV and Block V of the Virginia-class program, which were offset by contract incentives. Consolidated operating income for the quarter of $161 million increased by $7 million, or 4.5% from the first quarter of 2024, and operating margin of 5.9% in the quarter compares to 5.5% in the same period last year. The improvement was driven by a more favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment as well as the favorable segment results I've noted. Net earnings in the quarter were $149 million compared to $153 million in the first quarter of 2024. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.79 compared to $3.87 in the same period last year. Our contractual commitments increased by approximately $2.1 billion in the period, bringing backlog to $48 billion at the end of the quarter. Turning to slide 7. Cash used in operations was $395 million in the quarter. Net capital expenditures were $67 million or 2.5% of revenues. Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $462 million. This was within our free cash flow guidance range for the quarter, though at the low end of the range due to timing of incentives and normal fluctuations in program receipts and disbursements. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. We did pay a cash dividend of $1.35 per share or $53 million in aggregate. Turning to liquidity and the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $167 million and liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. Today, we are repaying a $500 million note and plan to utilize our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to support interim liquidity as free cash flow generation ramps through the year. This is in line with our prior expectations and was contemplated in the interest expense guidance that we had previously provided and are reiterating today. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We value our investment-grade credit rating. We will continue to strategically invest in our shipyards, thoughtfully grow our dividend and return excess cash through share repurchases. Moving on to our outlook on slide 8. We are reiterating all elements of the 2025 guidance, and there's no change to our medium to long-term thinking in terms of growth and profitability expectations. Our guidance is predicated on achieving the operational initiatives we have laid out for 2025. As Chris noted, we are progressing on each of these items, and we expect to achieve a meaningful improvement in throughput over the course of the year. For Shipbuilding, we expect second quarter sales of approximately $2.2 billion and margins near the low end of our annual guidance range. For Mission Technologies, we expect second quarter sales that are relatively flat sequentially and margins of 3% to 3.5%. We expect second quarter free cash flow to be between $200 million and $300 million. To close, I will echo Chris' positive sentiment regarding the company's mid to long-term outlook. We see incredible demand for critical products and services that we provide and are heartened by the administration's clear focus on growing our domestic shipbuilding capability and supporting a strong maritime industrial base. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Christie to manage the Q&A.
Christie Thomas: Thanks, Tom. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you very much, Christie. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Doug, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Harned: We've seen now with the CR with additional money for shipbuilding, infrastructure, and then this big authorization proposal that came up on the weekend. Now, when you look at all of this, there should be more money there. But the thing that I've sort of struggled with here is how to take that money and convert it into a plan that can address what you -- say, on the Virginia-class U, Electric Boat and the whole infrastructure needs to happen to really get throughput up. Can you comment on where the responsibilities lie, what the Navy is actually doing so that we can have confidence that not just the money is there, but the real actions are there to change the way things have been going over the last few years.
Chris Kastner: Sure, Doug. Let me give that a shot. That's a big question. And it's not only the budget, the FY 2024 boat, the executive orders related to commercial shipbuilding and then reconciliation. There's just a lot of tailwinds right now related to shipbuilding that we need to participate in. Now the first step in seeing what the investments are in that regard is this FY 2024 tub-boat contract. That was a product of really a couple of years of effort by the Navy and the shipbuilders to evaluate the investments that were required to get at accelerating throughput. You see that in the award of that contract. It was very thoughtfully put together. It's a wage support and workforce development support. It's very targeted investments to increase the submarine build rate. So that's all very positive. And then when you look at the CIB and the MIB funding that have been applied to the supplier base, that's also very positive. And you see a buildup of the infrastructure in shipbuilding that will support the growth that we think is ahead of us. So it's really, I would think, an industry-wide, all hands-on deck effort to identify a build-out of that industrial base. Now it's not easy. It takes time. These are heavy manufacturing facilities and equipment. This is building a workforce in a challenging environment. But I think it's only positive for HII and positive for shipbuilding.
Doug Harned: I guess the challenge here is that there's been a lot of discussion about this over the last few years. And just are there some specific things like if you start to look at what you need to get to that rate of 2 Virginia class per year, what's the trajectory for this? Are there specific things that will enable you and your partner to get there?
Chris Kastner: Absolutely. And really the first step of that is this FY 2024 tub-boat contract, targeted investments in workforce equipment, facilities, training that will accelerate the throughput. We have a lot of confidence that when these investments take hold, it's going to start to ramp throughput for the submarine program. And this shouldn't end here. We're going to negotiate Block 6 of the Columbia build 2 contracts. We've identified additional investments that could potentially be applied to further accelerate. So it's going to -- as I said before, it's going to take a while. You just don't build a building overnight. You don't build a workforce overnight. But I absolutely think that these are the right investments to get at the build rate.
Doug Harned: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Thank you
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. David, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Hi, good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Q – David Strauss: Chris, following up on the CR money, the 242 contract that was announced yesterday, it looks like it's a cost -- some form of cost contract. How is that -- I thought we were operating under fixed price on Virginia-class. So how is that potentially different? What does that contract contemplate differently, I guess, than prior contract?
Chris Kastner: Yes. It's a bit of a hybrid, but I'll kick it over to Tom. He can answer that.
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So it's a cost-type contract. It covers both parties, the Navy and ourselves concerns as far as what wants -- to be put on contract. It's a good mix and blend between affordability and profitability. It covers the business environment that we find ourselves operating in. So it's a CTIF and it has some constraints as far as some parameters around the outskirts of where costs can land. But we're happy that we were able to get that done. We've worked hard with the Navy, and it was approved through the government channels. And as you saw, it was awarded last night. So we're excited about that to get going on that contract.
Q – David Strauss: Okay. And any more detail on -- obviously, the shipbuilding margins in total came through better than what you had guided to. Newport News got a fair amount better. Ingalls kind of continue to step back. Can you just a little bit more detail on exactly what's going on and why you're forecasting kind of a margin step down again in Q2? And if you also want to talk about what EACs were in the quarter? Thanks.
Tom Stiehle: Yes, sure. So we guided 5.5 for the quarter. So we're happy with where we landed. We landed about 90 bps above that. Ingalls came in at 7.2 and it was a pacing quarter for them. I guess I can start with the EAC adjustments. We had 80 up and 80 down for a net of zero. So there's no break at that for you. So there was no cumulative adjustments across the company as a net. Ingalls pacing quarter, I would say, right now. We're watching how [indiscernible] are performing. We saw a little pressure on sales -- on the sales front, and it's kind of working ourselves through the heart of those programs down there. From a Newport News perspective, it was a good quarter as they came in at 6.1% on the margin side. It was a mix of some pressures that we've seen on CVN 80 that Chris talked about in his remarks as we're waiting for parts to pop in there. It's just having a little bit of a draw on the EAC schedule on that front. And then the VCS program as we're working people and parts to make sure we have enough people, talented people, the wage element of this recent award will help that. And on the parts side, just making sure we can feed that production line as that production line ramps up and wants to get to the one plus two that we talked about earlier here. So the new award assisted with that with some incentives that helped to offset that. But as I said, overall, it was a net neutral for EAC adjustments across the corporation.
Chris Kastner: Yes, David, this is Chris. I think you're seeing a bit of frustration regarding the timing of incentives kind of across the portfolio. I've spoken previously that we just have more incentives on our contracts now and the timing is variable at some point. So we try to guide based on what we see in front of us. And if we -- if incentives fall before or after, then it adjusts that a bit, but we're comfortable with our guidance.
Tom Stiehle: From SMT perspective, we saw that they had a very strong quarter. The CEW business unit performed well against the contracts they had and the uncrewed business unit that we have there is performing well right now. So it's a couple of dollars of margin accretive on that front. The guide for Q2 that you asked about, I think we're just being conservative right now. As Chris said, there's a lot of work to do, although we're on pace on where we want to be on cost reductions and throughput and the contract awards. We've got the first increment of this one here in the spring, and then we have VCS Block VI and Columbia Bill II at the back half of the year. But I think it's just conservatism and prudence on our side that we went back to the lower end of the range.
David Strauss: All right. Thanks very much.
Chris Kastner: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Mikus with Melius Research. Scott, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Scott Mikus: Morning, Chris and Tom. I wanted to follow-up on David's question about the two-boat Virginia contract. It was surprising to see that it was cost plus. But, obviously, there's funding in there for workforce development. Electric boat has an ongoing labor negotiation. I think Newport News is three collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2027. So until those negotiations are wrapped up, should we expect a greater share of shipbuilding orders over the remainder of this year and next year to be more cost-plus incentive fee type structures?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily assume that. We need to really get the wage support that's provided in two-boat out to our workforce as quickly as we can. I'm not going to get into dates or commitments about when that happens, because we do have to discuss that with our labor unions. But we believe that when we get the workforce, the support, the wage support to our workforce that retention will improve and productivity will improve, and we'll be able to make our throughput and our schedule commitments. So I wouldn't necessarily think that, that would dictate the contract types. And we're going to evaluate the appropriate contract types based on the situation at hand when we negotiate the contracts. So we're just going to have to move ahead from here on Block VI and Columbia Build II. The hybrid approach that essentially was put in place with the two boat contract forms an interesting basis to roll into those discussions, but we're going to have to establish those contract types as we engage with the customer and our partner.
Scott Mikus: Okay. And then the Golden Dome is also a big priority for the administration, and that's going to require a lot of equipment, especially radars and potentially the Aegis Ashore system. Lead times on radars are also very long. So has there been communication between shipbuilding and the administration about how to produce enough radars for both the Golden Dome and what the Navy needs for its shipbuilding priorities?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So we have not been involved in those discussions to date. I'm unaware of any discussions with the Navy and potential suppliers for that. So I will say our DDG 51 program is -- Aegis program is going well. We saw 129 go on the water, 128 will get to its first trials this year. So we're making progress on our milestones there. But relative to those ships with those new radars, but I'm unaware of any discussions relative to Golden Dome with our product.
Scott Mikus: All right. Thanks for taking the question.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question is from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Pete, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning guys. I guess, Chris or Tom, I'm not sure, but kind of a complicated situation, but you guys have nearly $50 billion in total backlog right now, and you're talking about an incremental $50 billion in new awards in the relative near-term. I probably not think that there's upward pressure on that 4% shipbuilding revenue growth guide in this type of backdrop? Is it still just early -- or is the labor situation that confounding? And I assume the 4% doesn't include the $150 billion in defense adds that's potentially coming down the pike as well. So, I just want to hear your thoughts on that.
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So the $50 billion in new awards includes the FY '24 2-boat contract, Block VI and the Columbia second build. It also includes the ASI bundle down in Ingalls. So I wouldn't necessarily correlate it to a $50 billion add in backlog from our current backlog levels. Now, tailwinds related to the 4% absolutely could happen. I'm not going to go there from a guidance standpoint at all right now. But the tailwinds between reconciliation, the executive order, these contracts being put under contract, the investments that are being made in the industrial base and the shipyards, there's absolutely medium-term upside related to that top line growth number. So we just need to take advantage of it, and that's what we're going to work to do over the next couple of years.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. I appreciate it. Just one last one for me on Ingalls margin. It used to be kind of reliably in the double digits, and it's kind of regressed over the past 5 quarters or so. What time frame is reasonable for us to think about the current environment changing to one where positive EAC adjustments are more -- maybe more likely than not?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. I think you nailed it, Pete. Corporate is positive easy adjustments. It's not so much that we're realizing kind of negative adjustments, but we're staying on our run rate, and we're neutral there. All 3 of those programs are in the production environment, the engineering works, the facility is up and running. We've come through the shipyard of the future and we're facilitized. It's really just about people and parts, being able to hire enough and keep the retention. And as we go forward with that to make sure that we feed the factory to run its production environment there. So I'm comfortable with the leadership down there and that we understand those ships. I think it's just coming post COVID and getting the sand out of the gears there and having the production flow run as fast as possible. We are down probably a couple of years and hours of experience down there. That just works itself through maybe not as cost efficient to realize those upsides or maybe a little bit more rework from time to time, maybe a piece of late material, whether it's CFE or GFE just all conspires to maybe not have a month or 2 early in schedule or an EAC reduction that we just kind of finish on par. But I'm comfortable with where they are right now. I mean, I'd love to see upsides every quarter, but we have not seen like major step backs down there. So I think they understand what's in front of them. It's the throughput we've talked about, more cost efficiency, keep the factory fed with parts. And that shipyard with that portfolio has a legacy of performance. So I think that they'll turn the corner. We haven't given you the time frame yet, and we'll keep you informed quarterly as we watch that proceed forward.
Pete Skibitski: Appreciate it guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Myles, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Maybe, Chris, could you start by talking a little bit about the workforce and how it trended in the first quarter? I think you probably picked up about 500 employees with W International and the press release is still talking about 44,000 employees. So was there much of a movement in net hiring? And how is attrition doing?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So, interesting. Good question, Myles. We hired 1,000 people in the first quarter, 1,000 craftsmen and women. That's directly related to the change in the strategy in both shipyards to hire more experienced personnel and improve the mix of experienced versus new hires. We think that strategy makes sense. We're going to continue to execute on that. The good news is attrition is down in both shipyards. Not materially down, not back to pre-COVID levels, but it is definitely moving in the right direction. So yes, hired 1,000, which is a bit south of where we wanted to be, but it's consistent with our strategy and attrition is a bit better in both shipyards, which is very positive.
Myles Walton: Okay. And regarding the 35% increase in outsourcing, can you comment on where you are with respect to that and sort of how the performance quality is looking from what you're outsourcing?
Chris Kastner: Actually, the way we've executed on our outsourcing program has been very positive. We had some tough lessons learned back at Ingalls and outsourcing in the early 2000s. And we've used those lessons learned and applied them at both shipyards. So, the quality is pretty good. We do pilots in these manufacturing yards before they actually execute work at scale, and we learned through that process, they've done that. We are on schedule in both yards in outsourcing for the year and the quality looks good. So, we're going to continue it. We need to. The industrial base is expanding. We need to take advantage of it, but we need to make sure that it's always high quality because if it's not, you have to redo it and that doesn't help us at all. So yes, it's very positive right now.
Myles Walton: Okay. And last one on the SAS program, is there a direct benefit to the carrier programs? Or is it more of an indirect benefit with the submarines being the direct beneficiaries?
Chris Kastner: Yes. It supports the entire nuclear industrial base, so -- and nuclear infrastructure. So, aircraft carriers get support in that as well.
Myles Walton: All right. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Seth, your line is now open, please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hi, thanks very much and good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: I wanted to when we think about kind of the direct impact of the contract that was announced last night, is there kind of a sizable cash advance associated with it? And is that part of the cash guidance for Q2? And does it enable signing the contract give you opportunity to change some of the assumptions across the different work at Newport News beyond just the two subs that were contracted?
Chris Kastner: Let me start with that. So guidance assumes execution of the Block V Build II contract that it has all year. And we assume incentives and capital incentives in all of our guidance. So, there are some incentives in Q2 related to that contract as well as other contracts. So it's all in the mix when we come through our guidance for free cash flow for Q2 as well as the end of the year. I don't know, Tom, if you want to add anything in regard to that.
Tom Stiehle: You really hit it. I mean it was incorporated into the guide that we gave you for Q2. We mentioned at the very beginning of the year expectation to have both that award and then in the back half of the year, VCS Block VI and Columbia Bill II. So we're really happy we got that done here. Cash comes from margin, margin can come from operational performance, capital incentives, performance incentives. And with the new contract add, it helps out incrementally, but it was in the mix, and it was in line with what we expected here. So I'm comfortable with both the guide that we've given you now for Q2 at $200 million to $300 million supports the $300 million to $500 million for the entire year with no change. We have pathways to get there. So I appreciate the question.
Seth Seifman: And on the assumed -- on the booking rate part of that?
Chris Kastner: Well, it's all included in our guide and in our accounting. So it's -- we had always assumed that this contract was going to get done this year in all of our -- in our accounting and in our guidance.
Seth Seifman: Okay. And then just a little bit bigger picture. You had this announcement with -- I think, with Hyundai during the quarter. And one of the topics that some people in Washington are discussing in terms of ways to accelerate shipbuilding is through partnership with other countries. This seems like a pretty early effort based on what was in the press release. But how do you think about where that could go and where international partners might actually be able to fit in?
Chris Kastner: Thank you for that question. Yes, it is early on in a strategic relationship that's very broad in nature, and it's going to apply to commercial shipbuilding and potentially taking advantage of the economic situation arising out of the executive order on commercial shipbuilding to see if there's an economic model that makes sense for expanding the commercial shipbuilding base in the United States. And then best practices in defense and military shipbuilding. We've been in their shipyard. They've been in our shipyard. They're a great shipbuilder. We're a great shipbuilder, and we can learn from each other. So it's very broad in its nature right now. I think it's -- when you think about having allies participate in shipbuilding, that only makes sense. an expansion of the capacity only makes sense and bringing the best people to the table to execute against this is only the right thing to do. So we don't know where it's exactly going to take us at this point. It's in the initial talks, but we need -- it's part of taking advantage of what we see as a pretty significant tailwind in shipbuilding.
Seth Seifman: Very interesting. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Jason, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky: Great. Thaks. Good morning, everybody.
Chris Kastner: Hey, Jason.
Jason Gursky: Chris, we've talked about this kind of in bits and pieces throughout the call today and I think in prior calls. But I'd like to just ask kind of a step back, bigger picture question about the timing of the transition from pre-COVID to post-COVID chips and maybe give you an opportunity to kind of update us on any changes to the timing and maybe the major risks and opportunities in that time line? I think you announced today some modest delays on the carrier side. So I just want to make sure we're kind of baseline -- rebaselined here on the expectations on timing of that transition.
Chris Kastner: I think we said that 50% was going to -- we're going to hit the 50% mark or beyond 50% mark in 2027. That's correct. You're correct to pick up on the 80 -- the issues with CVN-80 related to the equipment that's late in the bottom of the ship. We expect to get that over the summer. And then when that gets in, we'll start to make more progress. But that's -- there's no change in the balance of our milestones. We're in a pretty good place there. So I still expect that transition to be on schedule.
Jason Gursky: Okay. Great. And then Christie is restricting us to one follow-up question. So this might be like a couple of three parts here. I'm just kind of curious on all the reform and the executive orders that are -- have been coming our way to get your thoughts on a couple of different things. First, on shipbuilding assistance of investment that might go into the shipbuilding industrial base. Kind of what strings might be attached to it? And what the -- do you need to invest ahead of getting funds? And does that change the potential cash flow profile ahead for you? And then you mentioned OTAs in your prepared remarks and I think it's kind of tied up in the potential for acquisition reform of FAR and DFARS specifically. So I'm kind of curious, is that something that is going to impact -- those kinds of mechanisms will impact the Mission Systems business more than shipbuilding per se? And what do you think is the long-term impact on the Mission Systems business from a risk and opportunities and margins?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Jason. So first things first, the reform, executive orders and cash flow profile. Look, I think it's too early for that right now. There's a lot of work going into making recommendations on how those are rolled out. If you read the executive order, a significant amount of activity that we need to participate in quite actually because we think we can add a lot of provide a lot of input to them so we can kind of get to the right answer. But -- so yes, a lot of work by the team, the government team and the shipbuilding office over the next 30, 60, 90 days to further define what those mean, what the economics mean, what the investments mean. And we'll know more, but I don't see a -- definitely a cash flow drain by us related to that at this point, but more to come. On the OTAs, those are only positive. Things happen faster in an OTA environment. We're pretty good at them. We -- our uncrewed small uncrewed vehicle was an OTA that was converted to a program of record and very positively. So we only see upside related to that. We're comfortable with it. We're going to lean into it. So there is potential upside within Mission Technologies related to that activities. And the rapid capability office sort of activities with our high-energy laser that we're providing for the Army is also positive. So I think you have to lean into this stuff. Historically, our Mission Technologies division has been very good at applying commercial technologies to some of the biggest problems that the DoD has. We're going to continue to do that. We have a team that can do that within Mission Technologies. So as I said before, we're going to lean into it, and I see potential upside related to it.
Jason Gursky: Awesome. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Noah, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Yes. Thanks. It was reported in the press, and I think you discussed that there was a draft of the Maritime executive order that included the SAS language. And then we now have the executive order, it doesn't include it. And we have kind of a -- I mean, I know it's a very long-cycle business, but a long planning process to sort out where to go from here. I was curious what your sense is for why that changed in the process? And how likely or unlikely it is that that you eventually see SAS?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So that's probably not important to how it did not end up in the final executive order. I'm sure that those are -- that's why they're drafts. They go through review with the different elements of the government and ultimately, it wasn't included. Do I think SAS will happen in the future? Look, SAS did a lot of really interesting things. It was very innovative. It accelerated investment into the shipyards to get at the submarine production rate. But right now, our baseline is the Block V contract, the Block VI contract and Columbia Bill 2, and we're working with our customer to March 4 to get those under contract. Now the really good part about SAS is it identified in detail the investments we thought we needed to get this done. You see those investments show up in the Block V contract. And as we move through Block VI and Columbia Bill 2, they should show up there as well. So SAS called another name, but the investments are required. The team knows it. They put those investments together as a team. So we need to make sure that we continue to make those investments to get to the build rate. So it's -- SAS is something that is a name at this point that could or could not happen in the future, but the investments have to happen in order to get to the build rate.
Noah Poponak: Okay. Chris, how much have you been able to raise wages in recent periods to get the attrition improvement that you referenced? And how much more do you have to raise wages to make much more significant strides on that front?
Chris Kastner: So I think the attrition improvement has really been a result of the targeted hiring of more experienced labor. We have addressed wages very tactically, both at Ingalls and Newport News, but we do have labor arrangements, so we haven't been able to do broad labor adjustments. But I think the attrition improvement is more directly related to our hiring strategies to focus on more experienced people.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And then lastly, Tom, can you just give us the very specifics on why both the Shipbuilding and the MT margin are down a decent amount sequentially in the second quarter?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So as we said earlier, just the guide that we're giving is on the conservative side. We saw from MT crew and uncrewed and CEW do well for the quarters as they booked up and they closed out some projects. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. And then from a Shipbuilding side, I think we're just being conservative. We have some risk to burn down through the year and the initiatives that we've talked about more progress and the cost reductions, I want to see them kind of play out. We do have plans in place for that to occur. But with the risk and variability, we're just staying and guiding closer to the low end of the range there. I'm still comfortable with the guide that we have from 5.5% to 6.5%. It was a good first quarter out of the gate, and we'll adjust kind of going forward as we see successive quarters do well.
Noah Poponak: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Ron, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Hey. Good morning guys. Maybe going back to…
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Ron Epstein: …a couple of questions we've heard before, maybe Doug's earlier. And what has to happen in the shipyards to really update the manufacturing process, right? I mean when you look at how the Koreans, do it and their commercial operations, it seems like there's more automation, they build ships differently. I mean realistically, how much of that can be deployed in our military shipyards to improve throughput in the whole nine yards?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. I like the distinction you're making between the Commercial manufacturing process and the Defense process. They are different. When you're getting at a rate on fairly simple ships to build that aren't as dense, it's just a different process. So what's it going to take? Fortunately, we've been doing this work for a while now, identifying, what's it going to take to increase the submarine throughput, and it's going to show up on that FY 2024 two-boat contract. These are targeted investments to create capacity and increase the efficiency on how the ships and how the manufacturing works through the process. We've been working very hard at it. We know where the constraints are. And once they get implemented, I'm very confident that things are going to improve.
Ron Epstein: I mean is it more automation? I mean are there things like that that you can do, to take out variability or...
Chris Kastner: It's more about streamlining. There is some automation that can take place to begin at the front end of the process. We have AI pilots going on in both shipyards where we can be more efficient in analysis of scheduling per se or quality. But this is more about efficiency of the manufacturing process and eliminating roadblocks or ensuring that your critical path is squared away. It's not real automation when you get to the back half of the process. This is all about throughput and efficiency and throughput.
Ron Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then maybe just one more, what are you seeing in terms of demand for your unmanned product for the autonomous stuff?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So really good in the uncrewed space, not only in our -- as I said in my remarks, we have really a couple of hundred in backlog. We could have significant ramp this year executing on that small uncrewed underwater vehicle space. So demand is only improving in the uncrewed space, underwater uncrewed space, not only for that product, but derivatives of that product, both domestically and internationally, so some very positive developments in the uncrewed space.
Ron Epstein: Got it. All right. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you very much. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Kastner, for any closing remarks.
Chris Kastner: Thanks again for your interest and participation today. I look forward to providing updates as we progress throughout the year.
Operator: Thank you very much, everyone, for joining. That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Matters discussed on today's call that constitute forward-looking statements, including our estimates regarding the company's outlook, involve risks and uncertainties and reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. These risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at ir.hii.com. On the call today are Chris Kastner, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Chris. Thanks, Christie.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. Last year, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. employees remained steadfast in our commitment to our mission of delivering the world's most powerful ships and all-domain solutions in service of the nation. I thank them for these efforts, which contributed to Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. reaching critical milestones last year. We remain focused on meeting our commitments to the Navy and all our customers. Before I discuss the 2024 results, operational initiatives, and guidance, I would like to put in context where we are and give you a perspective on the next 24 months, as well as the mid to long-term outlook. Over the next 24 months, we expect to secure over $50 billion of contract awards. These contracts are being and will be negotiated with current performance and economic conditions in our estimates. They are expected to have a more balanced risk equation, be predictable in cost and schedules for our customers, and provide an opportunity to achieve margins more consistent with historical norms. At the same time, we are achieving key milestones on ships contracted prior to COVID. And as our progress continues, these contracts are of our portfolio and less of a drag on our financial results. By 2027, the majority of pre-COVID contracts will be behind us. In addition, our focus on increasing throughput and cost reductions is expected to lead to improved operational execution across the business. With these operational initiatives and the significant demand for our products and services, we expect improved financial performance over the mid to long term. We anticipate growing to $15 billion of annual revenue by 2030, with associated margin expansion, opportunity, and free cash flow growth. Now turning to our 2024 results. We generated sales of $11.5 billion and earnings per share of $13.96. All three of our divisions hit key milestones and won significant new business the year. 2024 awards totaled $12 billion, and our year-end backlog was $49 billion, of which $27 billion is funded. Now I'll provide some highlights from each of our divisions. First, Mission Technologies had another strong year. It achieved awards of more than $12 billion in potential total contract value, a 2024 book-to-bill of 1.33, and 9% revenue growth year over year. This positive performance reflects Mission Technologies' continued alignment with our country's and our allies' national security strategies. For example, in 2024, Mission Technologies achieved its largest win ever, a $6.7 billion contract to provide electronic warfare engineering and technical services support for the US Air Force, as well as a $3 billion LOGIX task order to provide logistic services, ISR operations, and next-gen tech. And in Australia, Mission Technologies was awarded an initial five-year contract to the Australian government's Department of Defense. In summary, the Mission Technologies team is executing well, and we are confident in its ongoing success, particularly given how closely its portfolio maps to our defense customers' needs. In 2024, at Ingalls Shipbuilding, we were awarded a $9.6 billion multi-ship procurement contract for the construction of LPD 33, 34, and 35, and large deck amphibious ship LHA 10, which secures ANFIP production backlog well into the next decade. Also, we delivered OPD 29 USS Richard M. McCool Junior and launched LPD 30 Harrisburg, and we continue to make progress on the DDG program with six destroyers in production, authenticating the kill of DDG 133 Sam Nunn in the fourth quarter. Finally, we completed dry dock work and undocked USS Zumwalt DDG 1000 in December. In 2024 at Newport News Shipbuilding, in the Virginia class submarine program, we floated off SSN 798 Massachusetts, delivered SSN 796 USS New Jersey, shipped the final module of SSN 801 Utah, and in December, we christened SSN 800 Arkansas. As for aircraft carriers, we completed dry dock work for the RCOH of CVN 74, USS John C. Stennis, and were awarded the advanced planning contract for the RCOH of CVN 75 USS Harry S. Truman. Also, 94% of CVN 79 Kennedy compartments have been turned over to the Navy, and all combat systems have been turned over to the test team. And CVN 80 Enterprise was moved for the first time, enabling construction of two aircraft carriers at once in the same dry dock. Looking ahead to 2025, at Ingalls, we expect to launch DDG 129, Jeremiah Denton, and complete sea trials for DDG 1000. At Newport News, we plan to deliver SSN 798 and float off SSN 800. Also, the team is focused on completing CVN 79. CVN 79 is scheduled to deliver in 2025, and the program team is evaluating options for optimizing combat capability additions and readiness for Navy workups. In 2026, we expect to deliver DDG 128 Ted Stevens LHA 8 Bougainville at Ingalls. In Newport News, we expect to deliver SSN 800 and lay the keel for CVN 81 Dory Miller. In 2025, we are also doubling down on operation improvement actions to address the residual COVID-related labor, productivity, and supply chain challenges we've been facing. Starting with labor and enhancing throughput, in 2024, we exceeded our hiring goal of over 6,000 craft personnel, but attrition remains stubbornly high. Our data shows that additional investment in wages in coordination with our Navy partner will provide needed workforce stability. These increases also allow us to attract highly skilled first-class shipbuilders with the proficiency they bring. Additionally, we continue to deploy our enterprise operating system across all our Shipbuilding programs to ensure consistency. On labor and throughput, we have acquired the assets of an existing advanced metal fabricator, W International, in Charleston, South Carolina. This acquisition increased our workforce by approximately 500 highly trained personnel, and we plan by 2027 to increase employment significantly at this site, a 480,000 square foot facility. Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Charleston operations is already working on aircraft carrier units for Newport News, and in the next few weeks, we expect to start submarine unit construction. Similarly, we plan to increase our outsourcing by 30% in 2025 and insource contract labor to address critical skill gaps within our shipyards. As a result of these workforce strategies, we expect to achieve a 20% year-over-year improvement. Our second operational initiative is an annualized enterprise-wide cost reduction target of approximately $250 million per year. Several actions have already been taken to achieve this target, including the realignment of the Mission Technologies segment from six business units to four and the implementation of a new payroll system at the beginning of 2025. Further cost efficiency plans around optimizing cost structures, decreasing overhead, and service and support costs, and reducing third-party services are under development and are expected to be executed throughout 2025. Our third operational initiative for 2025 is ensuring our new contract awards reflect the current economic and production environment. Regarding the FY24 Block 5 submarine contract agreement, negotiations are continuing. We continue to be confident that an agreement will be reached, although we do not have certainty today on the timing of that agreement. These three items—meeting our throughput improvement goals, executing our cost reductions, and achieving new contract awards that reflect the current economic and production environment—underpin our guidance and are expected to bring more predictability to our contract cost estimates, delivery schedules, financial performance, and guidance. In terms of our financial outlook, more specifically for 2025, we expect shipbuilding revenues between $8.9 and $9.1 billion, and shipbuilding margins in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. For Mission Technologies, we expect revenues between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion and margins between 4% and 4.5%, with EBITDA margins between 8% and 8.5%. Our free cash flow outlook for 2025 is between $300 million and $500 million. The 2025 shipbuilding margin and free cash flow outlook is predicated on meeting our throughput and cost reduction objectives. It also assumes appropriate resolution on the last two VCS Block 5 boats, the Block 6, and Columbia Bill 2 contracts, consistent with the continuing resolution anomaly language that was passed by Congress. Turning to activities in Washington for a moment, we are pleased with the passage and enactment of the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2025. The FY25 NDAA strongly supports our shipbuilding programs. In addition to authorizing funding for three Arleigh Burke class surface combatants, one Virginia class submarine, and one San Antonio class amphibious warship, the NDAA authorizes the refueling and overhaul of CVN 75, additional incremental funding for the second Virginia class attack submarine in FY25, and continued support for Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers in the LHA and LPD amphibious warship bundle. The NDAA also recommends the Navy optimize aircraft carrier acquisition strategy and procure CVN 82 in FY28. We applaud Congress for including anomalies in the CR that provide additional support for nuclear-powered vessel programs, and we look forward to Congress finalizing FY25 appropriation bills. In summary, we continue to make progress on our programs with impactful operational initiatives that we believe will lead to meaningful improvements in productivity and throughput. Demand for our products and services is strong, and we continue our focus on executing for our key customer, the US Navy, with five deliveries over the next two years. We have a line of sight for generating approximately $15 billion in annual revenue by the decade's end, with incrementally improving operating margins over that period, which will facilitate improved results for all stakeholders. So with that, I will turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financial results and guidance. Tom?
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I'll review our fourth quarter and full-year results and also provide some additional color regarding our outlook for 2025. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated fourth quarter results on Slide 6. Our fourth quarter revenues of $3 billion decreased approximately 5% compared to the same period last year. This decline was driven by lower year-over-year revenue at all three segments. Ingalls revenues of $736 million decreased $64 million, 8%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, driven primarily by lower volumes on amphibious assault ships, partially offset by higher surface combatant revenues. At Newport News, revenues of $1.6 billion declined $77 million or 4.6% from the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to lower RCOH volumes, unfavorable cumulative adjustments on the Virginia class and aircraft carrier construction program, partially offset by higher Columbia class volumes. Mission Technologies fourth quarter 2024 revenues of $713 million decreased $32 million or 4.3% from the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by lower volumes in C5ISR due to nonrecurring product revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. Moving to Slide 7, segment operating income for the quarter was $103 million, and segment operating margin was 3.4%. This compares to $330 million and 10.4%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter 2023 results included two nonrecurring variable items that make for a difficult year-over-year comparison. The first item was a $70.5 million sale of a court judgment at Ingalls. The second was a $49.5 million insurance claim settlement at Mission Technology. Ingalls operating income of $46 million and margin of 6.3% compares to $169 million and 21.1%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2023. The prior year period included both the favorable sale of a court judgment that I noted as well as a surface combatant-related contract incentive. Newport News fourth quarter 2024 operating income of $38 million and margin of 2.4% compares to $110 million and 6.6%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2023. The declines were driven by lower performance on Virginia class submarine new carrier construction, partially offset by contract incentives on the Columbia class program. Shipbuilding margin for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 3.6%. Mission Technologies fourth quarter operating income of $19 million and segment operating margin of 2.7% compares to $51 million and 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The declines were primarily driven by a favorable insurance claim settlement that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net earnings in the quarter were $123 million compared to $274 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.15 compared to $6.90 in the fourth quarter of the previous year. Moving on to consolidated results for 2024 on Slide 8. Revenues of $11.5 billion increased $81 million or approximately 1% compared to 2023. Growth was driven primarily by higher volumes at Mission Technologies, partially offset by lower volumes at Newport News Shipbuilding. Ingalls revenues of $2.8 billion in 2024 increased $15 million or half a percent from 2023, driven primarily by higher volumes in surface combatants, largely offset by lower amphibious assault ship and NSC program revenues. At Newport News, 2024 revenue of $6 billion decreased by $164 million or 2.7% from 2023, primarily due to unfavorable Virginia class cumulative adjustments as well as lower volumes in aircraft carriers and nuclear support services, partially offset by higher volume on the Columbia program. Mission Technologies 2024 revenues of $2.9 billion increased $138 million or 8.8% from 2023, primarily driven by higher volumes in cyber, electronic warfare, and space, as well as C5ISR contracts. Moving to Slide 9, segment operating income for the year was $573 million, and segment operating margin was 5%. This compares to $842 million and 7.4% in 2023. Ingalls operating income of $211 million and margin of 7.6% in 2024 compared to $362 million and 13.2%, respectively, in 2023. The declines were primarily driven by the sale of the court judgment in 2023, as well as lower performance on amphibious assault ships and surface combatants. Newport News 2024 operating income of $246 million and margin of 4.1% compared to $379 million and 6.2%, respectively, in 2023. Decreases were primarily driven by lower Virginia class and aircraft carrier performance, partially offset by Columbia class contract incentives. Shipbuilding margin for 2024 was 5.2%, within the revised guidance range we provided for the year. Net cumulative adjustments for the year were negative $120 million. Newport News's net cumulative adjustment was negative $154 million, partially offset by positive net cumulative adjustments at both Ingalls and Mission Technologies, approximately $14 million. Mission Technologies 2024 operating income of $116 million and segment operating margin of 3.9% both improved from $101 million and 3.7%, respectively, in 2023. The improvement was driven primarily by volume and performance in cyber, electronic warfare, and space contracts, stronger performance in fleet sustainment, as well as higher equity income. Again, the Mission Technologies 2023 results included a favorable $49.5 million insurance claim, so we are lapping that difficult comparison, and we believe our results still show strong absolute income growth and margin expansion for the year. Mission Technologies 2024 results included approximately $99 million of amortization to purchase intangible assets, compared to approximately $109 million in 2023. Mission Technologies EBITDA margin for 2024 was 7.9%. Company net earnings in 2024 were $550 million, compared to $681 million in 2023. Diluted earnings per share in 2024 was $13.96, compared to $17.07 in 2023. Turning to cash and capital deployment on Slide 10, 2024 free cash flow was $40 million, consistent with our most recent guidance reflecting factors previously discussed. During the year, the company invested $353 million in capital expenditures or 3.1% of sales, as we continue to prioritize higher throughput in our shipyard. We paid $206 million in dividends while ending 2024 with $831 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand and liquidity of approximately $2.5 billion. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $47 million in 2024. Our pension outlook for 2025 has modestly improved from the update that we provided in November, given this increase in discount rates partially offset by 2024 asset returns that were slightly below our expectations. Actual asset returns for 2024 were 7.7%. Our five-year pension outlook has been updated and is available in the appendix of today's presentation on Slide 13. Turning to Slide 11 and our financial outlook. First, we are reaffirming our medium to long-term growth targets for both shipbuilding and mission technology. As Chris noted, we see a clear path to $15 billion in annual revenue by the end of the decade, given our robust backlog and very strong demand across the portfolio. Regarding 2025 expectations, Chris provided our operational guidance, but let me provide a bit more color on our cash flow outlook. We expect 2025 free cash flow of between $300 million and $500 million. Performance on contracts entered into prior to the commencement of the COVID pandemic has impacted our ability to achieve program milestones and corresponding cash receipts. We expect this headwind will continue in 2025, which, along with elevated capital expenditures and cash taxes, is impacting our overall cash generation. We expect 2025 capital expenditures to be approximately 4% of sales as we continue to invest in increasing our shipbuilding efficiency and throughput. Additionally, we expect our 2025 cash taxes will total approximately $220 million. Regarding our expectations for the first quarter in 2025, we expect approximately $2.1 billion for shipment revenues, $680 million of Mission Technologies revenues, the shipbuilding margin near 5.5%, and Mission Technologies operating margin of approximately 3%. Consistent with normal cash flow cadence, we expect first quarter free cash flow to be negative, representing a use of between $300 million and $500 million, as working capital continues to build through midyear before we are able to reach program milestones and contract awards. Turning for a moment to capital allocation, as we have highlighted today, we will continue to invest in our business to maintain and grow the capacity of our shipyards. Our approach to dividends and returning excess cash to shareholders remains unchanged. Our focus now, of course, is working through challenged contracts and returning free cash flow to more normalized levels. To close my remarks, achieving the throughput, cost reduction, and contract award initiatives that we have outlined are critical to stabilizing shipbuilding performance in 2025 and achieving the outlook we have provided. Similar to 2024, we expect that about 70% of the shipbuilding revenue generated in 2025 will be derived from pre-COVID contracts. We forecast approximately 60% of 2026 shipbuilding revenue will be derived from pre-COVID contracts. Finally, we expect that in 2027, the majority of the shipping revenue will be derived from contracts that reflect the current operating environment, and we will set the foundation for margin improvement and returns towards historical margin levels. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Christie for Q&A.
Operator: As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A. Thank you very much. If you would like to ask a question, please or your question has already been answered, please press star followed by two. Our first question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. Doug, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harned: Very good. Good morning. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Morning, Doug. So sorry for the background noise. We're going through a thunderstorm outside right now, but just bear with us a little bit.
Douglas Harned: Okay. I've got a snowstorm here too. So
Operator: Okay.
Douglas Harned: So if I go back a few years, there was a margin outlook that had always been talked about in the 9% to 10% level. And knowing that, I mean, the CPI is hardly a good indicator for inflation for you all. But can you give us a sense first when you look at the margin gap that you have now, how much of that would you attribute to inflation versus other operational challenges if you're, you know, looking back at that 9% to 10% projected level?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So that's a very interesting question, and I don't have a specific number for you, Doug. We do have some EPA protection on our inflation protection on our Ingalls contracts and limited EPA protection on material on our aircraft carrier contracts. But it's not just directly inflation that impacts you. It's a bit more nefarious than that because you have inflation that adjusts very quickly on some products and services that can be passed along very quickly to a customer where we have long-term contracts that we have to perform against the baseline that was negotiated. You really can't adjust as quickly, which leads to a less experienced workforce and performance challenges. So I hate to say that, you know, I hate to not give you a number related to that, but it's a broader question than just the calculation of the inflation impact on our ship programs. As related to that is in the supply chain, it's even if we have protection for it, the performance of the supply chain because of inflation is not as efficient. So it's a very broad answer. I apologize for not giving you a precise answer. But inflation kind of seeps into various elements of our cost structure, not just paying people more.
Douglas Harned: Well, just to follow on that, if you look outside of shipbuilding, the Pentagon has frankly not been very helpful at all in providing equitable price adjustments, and that's across many types of programs. And even though you have some, you know, it appears you've been facing a lot of the same problem, and everyone, I think there's universal acceptance of the importance of the Virginia class, the Columbia class. But when you're negotiating new contracts now, and what has been a tough funding environment, do you still see it as possible to get back to those 9% to 10% type margin levels that have been more traditional, or are we living in a different world now where you may have to sort of give in, in a sense, to lower financial performance?
Chris Kastner: Well, you know, yeah, interesting. I absolutely believe that 9% is possible moving forward. The $50 billion of contracts that, you know, we've negotiated some of those with the bundle, the amp ship bundle down in Mississippi, and we're negotiating the FY24 Block 5 two-boat contract now. The customer's been very receptive to understanding the current economic environment, and we will get inflation protection in those new contracts. I think you saw Congress put an additional $5.7 billion in the anomaly for those FY24 boats. There's a recognition that we need to rebuild this industrial base. There's also a recognition, I believe, that shipbuilders need to earn fair margins. And so we're taking that to the table, and we're going to make sure that that happens. But I absolutely believe that 9% is something that we can achieve. And the reason I believe it, Doug, is simply because I've done it before. Down at Ingalls, we're in the exact same position. We had to negotiate performance post-Katrina into the new dataset of ships. We got that done, and they had a very good run where there was predictable cost and schedule performance because, ultimately, it doesn't do anybody any favor to agree to cost estimates or schedules that are unrealistic. So we're going to make sure that that happens. I think the customer's on board with that. They want realistic, achievable schedules as well. And so I firmly believe that's going to happen.
Douglas Harned: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Seth, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hey. Thanks very much. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: In the prepared remarks, I think you talked about the guidance. What underpins the guidance, I think, expects for more predictability. Are you basically, what contract awards are you assuming that the company will get this year in the guidance?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. The summary and contracts, the seventeen boats contemplated by a bunch of support. If the phone, the four laws kind of plan that you've been advocating is assumed in this sense. No. Let me correct you there. It's not a full sol solace plan. We're negotiating FY24 two boats consistent with the acquisition approach that was set forth by Congress and supported by the anomaly. Block six and Columbia Bill two, we're going to have to see the acquisition approach for those boats as they develop. Saws or a derivative of saws, yes, is positive. Anything that brings additional investment into the industrial base that accelerates shipbuilding production is positive. But we're going to take this one step at a time.
Seth Seifman: So the guidance doesn't assume the seventeen boats get under contract?
Chris Kastner: It does. It assumes FY24 two boats and then assumes the negotiation of the Block three contracts and the Columbia Bill two contract, yes.
Seth Seifman: Okay. And do you, I guess, what gives you, have you had communications with the new administrator, what kind of gives you confidence that that's going to happen during this year?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So interesting. I have high confidence in the FY24 two boats that'll happen first part of the year. I have had limited conversations with elements of the new administration, and they've assured me that shipbuilding is one of their top priorities. And that's welcome. That makes perfect sense based upon the threat environment. So I believe we'll step right into Block six after we negotiate the last two block five votes.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it there for now.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Scott Mikus with Melius Research. Scott, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Scott Mikus: Good morning, Chris. I kind of want to follow up on your answer to Doug's question. When I think about post-Katrina, Northrop had a lot of struggles with the shipbuilding business before spinning it off to form Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Shipbuilding margins initially weren't that great post-spin, but come 2013, there was a meaningful pickup in favorable EAC adjustments, and your stock more than doubled that year. Just curious, what lessons did you learn from the late 2000s and early 2010s that are still relevant and can be applied today? And when do you think investors will see EACs flip from unfavorable to favorable?
Chris Kastner: Thank you. I'll start this answer, then I'll kick it over to Tom for some timing-related issues. But I have confidence that we can get this done because I've done it before, as you said. And the key is making sure that you're very transparent and disclose current performance, and ensure that you're resolute at the negotiation table. And there's achievable and predictable cost of schedule estimates when you do those negotiations. As I said previously, it doesn't do anybody any favors to miss schedules or miss cost estimates. So we just need to make sure that we estimate them correctly and negotiate them correctly. And that can be done. And there's $50 billion of work that's going to be negotiated here. It's just getting through the pre-COVID contracts is what's important. So I'll let Tom talk about the timing a little bit.
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris. Yes. As Chris had mentioned, both him and myself were down there. I spent ten years from 2011 through 2021. So I saw that march up, and it's really about making sure, one, we get good contracts and have a good cost-equal agreement balance between us and our customer. We've been hit now with COVID and inflation and things of that nature. It's really causing a draw on our production lines. These long-term contracts are being impacted by inflation. The number of heads experienced in the yard and the supportability of the material right now. So one is any of the new awards we get, like the bundle down in Ingles that we have, the FY23 award for destroyers that we received, and now going forward, the plethora of seventeen boats between the VCS one five, six, and Columbia Bill two. You know, getting balanced contracts that we have appropriate, our performance appropriately aligned, our schedules that we see right now are rolling it. The investments both from ourselves and from our Navy partner will have a positive benefit. But ensuring we have a solid program plan and we're putting good commitments on contract. And then, obviously, we've got to execute on our commitments on that front. So it's maintaining our budgets, holding schedules, making progress weekly, monthly, quarterly, and we have a track record of doing that. I'm confident we have the processes and the facilities for the most part, we need more throughput, but the processes and the tools and the facilities are in place right now. It's about building out the workforce we have, strengthening, and more consistent supply chain that we have against our schedules, and then us kind of hitting the mark in cost and schedule on a regular rhythm. That's what we did down at Ingalls. I think we have the pieces in place and where we are short on people, the cost reduction initiatives that we have right now, and we've talked about the contracts. Contract equity going forward here. I think we understand what's causing us a delay in our production programs. Specifically on VCS and some headwinds they have down at Ingles on the destroy program. And I think we're working hard putting the dollars and the pressure in the right areas to find the rhythm that we saw on the Ingalls march up post-Katrina. So we don't have a specific date for you on when we get back to those sort of profitability estimates. But as Tom mentioned in his script, we are transitioning over the next couple of years out of these pre-COVID contracts into the new contracts. And as we transition, there should be an uplift in profitability.
Scott Mikus: Okay. And then one quick follow-up. So the midpoint of the guidance implies about $540 million of shipbuilding operating income. I'm just curious, is there any assumption baked in there for what net EACs will be for this year?
Tom Stiehle: Yeah. So obviously, we run our EAC process on a quarterly basis. We don't provide, you know, the profitability by ship or by class like that, even by division. So we always bake in EAC and the estimate to complete in the EAC is aligned with our performance that we have right now. With risks and opportunities kind of hedged against that. Right? We know we're throwing additional investment dollars in it. And efforts and improvements of our production lines. We balance that with the risks and opportunities we see in front of us, so that sets the trajectory and how we expect to perform kind of going forward. And, again, that ETC estimate to complete on these EACs gets reevaluated every ninety days when we get another set of actuals. I'm not going to get into the specific details that we have in there, but, you know, we do expect a stabilization and an improvement as we go forward.
Scott Mikus: Okay. Got it. Thanks for taking the question.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Pete, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: I guess just sticking to the shipbuilding margin questions, it sounds like maybe you'd recommend we assume sort of gradual improvements on shipbuilding margin through kind of to the end of the decade, maybe hitting that 9% mark. And I don't know if we should think about a step change improvement in 2027 or just keeping it gradual. And then just wonder if you could talk about the, it sounds like you could potentially get a contract change on CVN 79. Wasn't sure if that, if you did get a contract change, if that would impact margin one way or another. Thanks.
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So let me start, and I'll let Tom chip in. Let me answer the 79 question first. Then I'll kick the margin timing question over to Tom. 79, yes. We do some additional capabilities that may expect a contract change related to in the ship. Maybe put in the program team's working on that. And with the objective of getting the ship delivered with the most capability and deployed as soon as possible. The program teams are working on that, and there would be a change related to that. But I don't think it's positive or negative. It's just an equitable adjustment related to the capabilities that are added. So with that, I'll send it over to Tom on the margin timing.
Tom Stiehle: Yeah. So specifically, obviously, we don't provide margin guidance for the following year or the out years. Obviously, there is a shape and an expectation we have right here. And, you know, as of Q3 last year, we missed the expectation of where we thought we were. You really got to get down to where we've been impacted. And, again, it's the less experienced labor we have, the throughput, and the support of supply chain. We see areas and we have initiatives to kind of improve all of that. So going forward, that's going to be a lift against all operations we have. Now for contracts that have run through COVID, you know, the older pre-COVID contracts, those contracts have seen increased costs. So there's limited ability to go and get additional profitability on those contracts. As we put the new work, the $50 billion on here, obviously, that didn't run through that. Gonna get the benefit of the current performance and where we stand right now. The opportunity is much greater to have the profitability bounce back. So I would say the way to model that is you follow the revenue in my remarks. I gave you the next and how it blends out. And by 2027, the majority of the work will be post-COVID work. And I do expect a ramp in profitability as we work ourselves through the decade. But always remember, we're pretty conservative when we start out ships. So I do agree it's going to increase. But I wouldn't anticipate a step change.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. For the call, guys.
Chris Kastner: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. David, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Morning.
David Strauss: Hey, Chris. Could you maybe talk about the opportunity to buy additional shipyard capacity? I think you've made some comments recently in the press around that. Can you kind of size that opportunity? And if I missed that, I apologize on the call. Or in your prepared remarks. What are your hiring plans in 2025 relative to 2024?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So we'll hire about the same amount. We've repositioned our hiring a bit, as I said in a previous earnings call, from kind of broadly hiring including entry-level to hiring more experienced people. We've actually made some progress in that regard. And specifically in Newport News, we had been hiring out of the pipeline, which is really the regional development centers. These are people that had chosen shipbuilding as a career. They've been at the 5% to 10% rate. That's increased to 35% at the back half of the year, which is really positive. And we would like it to get to 60% this year, and that's really thanks to the state of Virginia and the federal government for increasing the funding for those regional development centers. We're also targeting additional experience down at Ingalls, where they like to hire 80% experienced people. So while the number's the same, we're repositioning it a bit. Now your question about buying another shipyard, I'm really not interested in that. W International was an opportunity that came along, and they're a quality builder or manufacturer that has been in the shipbuilding industry, and we were concerned they were going to move out of the shipbuilding industry, and that is a problem. So we have a lot of outsource partners, and I'd rather develop outsource partners and have an arms-length relationship. I really don't want to vertically integrate, but this opportunity showed up, and we got 500 world-class shipbuilders with Newport News management team managing them. So this really was a layup for us. It's going to increase our throughput immediately. But I have no plans to right now, unless something very interesting came along, to buy additional manufacturing facilities.
David Strauss: Okay. Thanks. And Tom, a follow-up on free cash flow and capital deployment. In terms of your free cash flow progression beyond this year, I think about 2026, 2027 as the pre-COVID work runs off. Would you expect the free cash flow progression, given the CapEx and working capital investments you've had to make here, would you expect that free cash flow progression back to normal to maybe be faster relative to what we're going to see in terms of the runoff of the pre-COVID work? And then just how you're thinking about capital deployment, given the cash burn in Q1 and the debt maturity in, I think, the beginning of Q2? Thanks.
Tom Stiehle: Yeah. So I would expect, you know, as you work through, as Chris said, the chop in the water for the next twelve to eighteen months, the cash flow would ramp up, you know, and we would get back to more normalized levels as we work ourselves through the pre-COVID contracts that we have here. And you can time that as well as with the margin. The cash flow will follow that in the out years. So that's how that works. From the capital deployment, there's no change. We're still using the same process and the model that we have here. We'll continue to have a, we'll invest in the yard. We'll have a capital, we'll have a dividend that we have annually here. And any excess free cash flow, which we've been doing since 2001, will go back to the shareholders as that materializes. So no change in that policy right now. We did not provide any guidance for share buybacks in 2025. And if something changes on that front, we'll update you on a quarterly earning.
Chris Kastner: You know, I would add, it's an interesting question on projecting free cash flow right now. And I've spoken of this previously. I don't know if it's been picked up, but the incentive-laden nature of some of these contracts that are being led really lends itself to be difficult to project free cash flow timing. It's always been a challenge for us to project free cash flow timing because of the lumpy, you know, the limited amount of projects, large invoices can move across the period. But with these large incentives and the timing of these incentives and some of them not even being negotiated yet, it makes it a bit of a challenge. We're going to continue to be lumpy going forward, but I agree with Tom 100% it should incrementally improve over the long term.
David Strauss: Thanks very much.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Scott, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Scott Deuschle: Thanks. Tom, were the Virginia class negative EACs on the block four boats, the block five boats, or both?
Tom Stiehle: A mix of both.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. And I think the block five boats are post-COVID boats. Why should we only be focused on the pre-COVID ship? They were negotiated in 2019.
Chris Kastner: No. Those were negotiated in 2019.
Tom Stiehle: Yeah. They went in 2019. Yeah.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. And then, Chris, would the contract change on CVN 79 result in a change in delivery timeline for that ship?
Chris Kastner: We're working through that with the customer right now. Potentially, we're working.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. Can you remind me why the ship was originally delayed from 2024 to 2025? I thought it was something similar to what you're now saying may cause it to go into.
Chris Kastner: Well, there's a couple of changes, large changes that took place on CVN 79. The first one was related to some significant combat system work that the Navy asked us to do into the baseline work. I think what you're referring to is moving PSC. That was the schedule change previously, where we were going to deliver it, do a significant amount of PSA work, and then get it deployed. They moved that into the baseline, which caused a schedule change. This is additional capability that they've developed based on CVN 78's performance in deployment. And so you always want to get that as you learn. This is the second ship of the class. As you learn, you want to make sure that all the capabilities are in that ship when it gets deployed.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. And did you book a negative EAC on CVN 79 this quarter?
Chris Kastner: It wasn't material. Yeah. I think there's a modest negative adjustment.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll leave it there.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Myles, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Morning, Myles.
Myles Walton: I was curious on the shipbuilding margin guidance for 2025, five and a half to six and a half. In the first quarter, you're already at five and a half. I think the full year is predicated on material increases in throughputs and cost reduction as well as the contract word assumptions. So the question is, how much are you assuming is going to happen in the booking rate versus when those things happen, the margins will progress higher?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So all of that is included in the guide. Right? The new ships, meeting our throughput and our cost reduction initiatives, the timing of the new ships, an incentive assumption on those new ships. So it's kind of all in the mix. And then we do have a bit of a, it's a bit of a conservative guide related to, we've just had a couple of quarters of negative adjustments here, so we thought it was prudent to make it a bit conservative. So it's all in the mix. I'd like to say I could time it out for you. We'll give you the information every quarter on how we think the next quarter is going to be. But all of that factors into the guide.
Myles Walton: I guess the way I was going on is first quarter, you obviously would have the contract. You wouldn't have a lot of these cost improvements. So that five and a half percent, is that low end pretty much reflective of your current situation, ignoring, you know, the improvements you're talking about in throughput and cost improvement?
Chris Kastner: I think that's probably fair. But we're working hard to get that contract done.
Tom Stiehle: Miles, it's Tom. You know, we give the quota guide, so we're really close to that. And that's how we see it's going to play out. I mean, obviously, there's a timing of, like, the new contract award. There's the list that we expect to get from the initiatives that we have on the objectives page, the operational objectives page. Then there's just the run rate opportunities and risk that we see. Most closest to the slide here. So, I mean, it's in the mix there. Obviously, it's on the bottom end of the range here. Beginning of the year, but they'll be bait hopefully, they'll be bait against the contract awards. The initiatives we have. And then as the programs mature, going forward, we could realize, you know, the medium or the top end of that range.
Myles Walton: Okay. And then Chris, maybe a higher-level question. This move towards outsourcing, obviously, there's benefits to that. You could maybe control your cost or have a little bit more visibility on cost, but you're relinquishing some control and quality control in particular. How do you weigh that? And a move to increase it as much as you're talking about, 30%. I don't know what the base level is, so that could be a material number or could be an immaterial number.
Chris Kastner: Yeah. It's a material number. And the good news is we're outsourcing with partners that we already do outsource work with. So we're very familiar with them. We don't do this lightly. We do pilot projects so that the partners can demonstrate their cost and schedule and quality capability before we do it. So it's a good question because, you know, we've been burned by outsourcing before. I think a lot of people in the industry have, and we just need to make sure we do it right. So it's a fair, it's a risk that we understand and we mitigate because we've done it before.
Tom Stiehle: I would add on the back of that, like, an acquisition, like, W International are bringing it in-house with Newport News people, leadership processes. We put a proven workforce that's there that was up and running. You know, there's work going on down there right now and, you know, having 500 heads ready and moving forward, operationally is a big plus there. So we're doing it really smartly. We're ensuring who we insource to outsource. Putting the bumpers around to make sure we get the performance and expectations. And we anticipate that, you know, we'll be able to execute that work. And be a significant piece of the list that we talked about, about 20% more earn throughput.
Myles Walton: Okay. Alright. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Ron, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jordan Lyonnais: Hey. Good morning. This is Jordan on for Ron.
Chris Kastner: Hey. Good morning, Jordan.
Jordan Lyonnais: Morning. On the initiatives that you guys are working on for hiring, what's changed versus what you guys have been doing for the past couple of years? And also, how do you think Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. and Mission Tech specifically too, is there any impact from George?
Chris Kastner: Okay. Yeah. So first, what changes? I previously spoke about it's not only hiring. We've refocused that to target more experienced shipbuilders. Wages are going to help that. The anomaly has workforce development support, and so that will help that process to hire more experienced shipbuilders, and will assist in retention as well. Doge is, you know, it's the new administration. It's good that one of their top priorities is shipbuilding. We're all for reduced regulation. So we'll work with that team to ensure that we have the appropriate level of regulations, and trust me, no one wants less cost and better delivery schedules than I do. So we welcome the initiatives that could be put in place, and we would participate in that going forward.
Jordan Lyonnais: Great. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cohen. Gautam, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Gautam Khanna: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Chris Kastner: Morning, Gautam.
Gautam Khanna: So I have two questions. One, previously, you guys had thought about a cash inflow associated with signing the seventeen submarine contracts. I think it was a release of contract assets to receivable. Is that still true? And if you could quantify how much would be, you know, to be invoiced upon signing that, and then I have a follow-up.
Chris Kastner: Yeah. There is some cash upside to executing those contracts. We risk adjust all of that, and so we haven't broken that out, Gautam. But that's included in our guide, and there will be some cash receipts related to that.
Gautam Khanna: I recall a quarter ago, a lot of the free cash reduction was in the guidance for 2024 was those contracts moving out to signing. So is it about $500 million, and can you ballpark it for us?
Chris Kastner: I'd really rather not, Gautam, at this point. There's a lot of moving parts in the cash guide, as Tom mentioned previously. But, yeah, I'd really rather not ballpark that. But we're still in discussions with the government on that contract. We need to negotiate that really holistically. So I'd rather not give you specifics on the cash impact.
Tom Stiehle: I'll probably just like a little color there because I think as you referenced back to the Q3 call, your question's kind of getting your head around. Hey. That was near back half of the year that the omnibus approach, seventeen subs being put on contract was a pathway for us to still make our guide last year. Right? And we had the early question on SARS right now. So although that's viable and that's still out there and the industry still believes that's a very efficient way to get the most ships on contract built fastest. Right now, as you know, the CR just has an anomaly in there for the first two of the seventeen boats, and we're working very closely with the Navy partner to get those on contract near term. So the difference between where we were, say, last quarter and this quarter is just the contracting approach, the mechanisms. Is it an omnibus at all seventeen, which it would impact additional contracts, or is it just two boats for FY24 and incremental approach? Maybe you saw still an opportunity set behind it. But it brings us a little bit of an uncertainty of what was the cash perspective and outlook back in Q3 versus how we're going forward here. All these boats will get on contract. Right? We'll find a good risky equilibrium between us and our Navy partner. Right? And a balance between affordability and profitability. And we'll ensure that the deal on our side obviously meets the requirements and the expectations of our customer, while being true to bringing home a contract that we can go execute the cost and the schedule. It's aligned with our profitability expectations.
Gautam Khanna: Thanks, Tom. And just one last one. In private insurance, first time. We all remember the whole FSA discussion going to more unmanned, lighter ships. Is there any movement afoot? Have you heard anything from the new advanced station about their inclinations to revisit some of the recommendations back then?
Chris Kastner: Not yet, but it's early. The leadership is still getting confirmed. And we support, obviously, with our unmanned business, we support both. There's a high-low argument and actually a fact that is going to have to be executed. But, no, we've not had those conversations with the new administration yet because they just aren't there yet.
Gautam Khanna: Alright. Fair enough. Thank you, guys.
Chris Kastner: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you very much. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Kastner for any closing remarks.
Chris Kastner: Alright. Thank you for joining the call today. I appreciate everyone's patience. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 HII Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Christie Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mrs. Thomas, you may begin.
Christie Thomas: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the HII third quarter 2024 conference call. Matters discussed on today's call that constitute forward-looking statements, including our estimates regarding the company's outlook, involve risks and uncertainties and reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. These risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. We also will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at ir.hii.com. On the call today are Chris Kastner, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Christie, and thank you for joining the call, everyone. Earlier today, we released our third quarter results and announced updated guidance for the year. Before I get to the results, I want to thank the 44,000 HII employees who build ships in our shipyards and who solve some of the most pressing technical challenges related to our national security within our Mission Technologies division. At HII, our mission is clear. It is to deliver the most powerful ships and all domain solutions in service of our nation, creating advantage for our customers to protect peace and freedom around the world. Now for the results. Third quarter revenue was $2.7 billion and earnings per share was $2.56, down from $3.70 a year ago. We updated our shipbuilding revenue guidance for the full year to approximately $8.8 billion and our Mission Technologies revenue guidance to a range of $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion. We also updated our 2024 shipbuilding margin guidance to 5% to 6% and revised our 2024 free cash flow guidance to zero to $100 million. I'll provide some operational milestone updates and division highlights prior to providing a more detailed discussion surrounding the quarter's performance and guidance changes. During the quarter, Newport News shipped the final module of Virginia-class submarine Utah, SSN 801 and on CVN 79 Kennedy, the ship is progressing into the test and turnover phase. 92% of compartments have been turned over to the Navy and all 19 of the ship's combat systems are turned over to the government test team. Looking ahead, float off of SSN 800, Arkansas is moved to 2025 due to a customer-driven design change that requires incorporation prior to launch. At Ingalls Shipbuilding, we received the $9.6 billion award of the multi-ship procurement of amphibious warships, which provides strong revenue visibility for years to come. Combining this with a series of milestone achievements in the quarter and early October, including the launch of LPD 30 Harrisburg, the load-out of three or four hypersonic missile tubes into the DDG 1000 Zumwalt structure and Aegis Light Off on DDG 128 Ted Stevens, the second Ingalls Flight III destroyer, some solid progress is being made at Ingalls. Our results also reflect strong performance at Mission Technologies with 14% revenue growth year-to-date over 2023 and a third quarter funded book-to-bill of 2.2. Mission Technologies had several significant contract wins in the third quarter, totaling $11 billion of potential contract value, including a $6.7 billion contract to provide electronic warfare engineering and technical services support for the U.S. Air Force. The single award Indefinite Delivery and Indefinite Quantity contract is the largest-ever awarded HII's Mission Technologies division. We were also awarded a $3 billion federal government single award task order for National Security Services and new and emergent technology, a $458 million contract to modernize U.S. government comms and IT networks, and a $209 million contract to support U.S. Air Force Weapons Systems development and sustainment. We ended the third quarter with backlog of $49.4 billion, of which approximately $28 billion is currently funded. Further to results and guidance changes, two issues have impacted our expectations for the year. First, based on constructive discussions with our Navy partner, we expected to reach an agreement for Virginia-class Block V and Block VI and Columbia-class submarines in the second half of 2024. Starting this fall, some uncertainty emerged about the timing of that agreement, where we are confident an agreement will be reached and discussions continue, we have updated our profitability and cash flow assumptions based on the uncertain timing and structure of that award. We continue to pursue innovative contracting approaches that incentivize greater investments in our workforce, facilities, and technology. These investments are critical to the goal of yielding accelerated program schedules that meet their urgent needs of the Navy. Second, our assumptions of performance improvement and risk reduction have not been achieved. This is due to late critical material deliveries and reduced experience levels within our teams, both in production touch labor, and supervision. The combination of material delivery delays and inexperience leads to labor inefficiency and in some cases to rework, which affects program schedules. Late supply chain material has necessitated a renewed look at our labor plans and delivery schedules. This alignment of labor and material from the supply chain is critical to mitigating program cost. It bears repeating that nearly all the ships currently under construction were negotiated prior to COVID. These ship contracts, which provide long-term revenue visibility, did not anticipate in their cost targets and risk-limiting clauses, the significant disruption of our workforce and supply chain or the subsequent inflation experienced by us and the broader economy. They did not anticipate the significant loss of shipbuilding experience in our yards through early retirements and the training requirements of new shipbuilders. As I said, the terms of these contracts are still governing the majority of the work underway now at Newport News. Let me be clear, delays and cost increases on these ships are unacceptable to me, my team, and all of us at HII. Looking ahead, we continue to take decisive actions to focus on the fundamentals of shipbuilding to ensure that we finish these ships, get them delivered to the Navy, and transition to ships negotiated in the context of our current economic reality. Further, regarding actions to improve performance, I'll focus on three points, starting with workforce. I want to emphasize we have thousands of highly skilled and committed shipbuilders and their example and mentorship are invaluable as we develop a new generation of manufacturing talent to execute on our backlog and the demand ahead of us. We are making significant investments in craft proficiency training and in leadership development, so that our deck plate executes safely, efficiently, and with first-time quality. Our innovative craft learning centers, virtual and augmented reality training cells, and foreman support strategies are helping to accelerate learning within the teams. In partnership with the submarine industrial base, the Hampton Roads regional training pipeline has grown its capacity, allowing Newport News Shipbuilding to hire 30% of craft new hires from a pre-hire training pipeline, up from only 5% two years ago. Also at Newport News, we remain focused on deploying and maturing a common operating system across all programs to improve execution. In trades where we first piloted this, we have seen meaningful throughput improvement by enabling our frontline leaders to spend more time on the deck plate with their people and by standardizing and simplifying how they put their teams to work every day. We are also investing in data analytics and pilot projects utilizing AI to find faster solutions to material delivery delays and mitigate their impacts to ship assembly schedules. Scaling the operating system across all production areas is our best near-term opportunity to improve throughput while we pursue long-term structural improvements to our infrastructure, supply base, and workforce. Second, supply chain and supplier development, we are working with the Navy fueled by submarine industrial-based funding to improve supply-chain performance. With the goal of helping to accelerate throughput in the shipyards, we are also investing in new centralized manufacturing centers of excellence for high-risk items to improve cost and schedule predictability for these build sequence critical parts. Third, capacity, we are outsourcing additional work to new suppliers, which helps to rebuild the industrial base and takes the work to where there is additional workforce and investing in new industry 4.0 technologies, including additive manufacturing and digital engineering. As an example, we are outsourcing over 1 million hours in 2024 and plan to increase that by over 30% in 2025. We are committed to growing the manufacturing ecosystem necessary to build these ships. Additionally, we are reviewing costs across all three divisions to remain competitive and meet our cost objectives. This enterprise-wide review includes a thorough evaluation of our overhead costs and support costs to ensure that each element supports our customer requirements. We are evaluating capital in a similar fashion and ensuring we focus our capital on improving throughput. While our previous cash-flow forecast included a capital expenditure target at 5% of sales from 2024 through 2026, we have reduced our planned spend for 2024 and we are thoroughly evaluating our 2025 and 2026 capital plans to reflect the uncertainty of the timing and structure of the future contracting activity. Turning to Washington, while the government operates under a continuing resolution into December, we continue to engage with the Navy on the most appropriate path forward on the submarine contracts. As demonstrated with the recent multi-ship procurement award for amphibious ships, HII has a record of reaching equitable agreement on this type of contract that delivers sustainable returns for the company and savings to the customer. In closing, before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to emphasize these primary points. First, we are confident we are focused on the right things on the fundamentals to execute on our current backlog. And once we transition to these post-COVID contracts, cost and schedule performance and predictability will improve. Second, on the outstanding contract awards in shipbuilding, we expect agreement at a fair cost and schedule that reflects our current operating environment and we will continue to work with the Navy until we get this complete. Finally, the long-term value equation for HII has not changed. There is unprecedented demand for our products and services. We remain confident in our mid to long-term guidance of 9% to 10% shipbuilding margins and we firmly believe the actions we are taking will enable us to stabilize performance as we continue to work through these ships. And now, Tom?
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Let me first start by briefly discussing our third-quarter results and then I'll address our updated outlook. For more details, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 6 of the presentation, our third-quarter revenues of approximately $2.7 billion decreased 2.4% compared to the same period last year. This decreased revenue was attributable to declines at both Ingalls Shipbuilding and Newport News Shipbuilding, partially offset by growth at Mission Technologies. Operating income for the quarter of $82 million decreased by $90 million or 52.3% from the third quarter of 2023 and operating margin of 3% in the quarter compares to 6.1% in the same period last year. Decreased operating income was largely driven by declines at both Newport News and Ingalls, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Net earnings in the quarter were $101 million compared to $148 million in the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $2.56 compared to $3.70 in the third quarter of the prior year. Our contractual commitments increased by approximately $900 million in the period, bringing backlog to $49.4 billion at the end of the quarter, while we did secure the $9.6 billion award in the court at Ingalls for four amphibious ships, including LHA 10, LPD 33, 34 and 35. We recorded just the authorized value to date, approximately $565 million in the quarter. We will see the awarded values of those ships grow over time as authorizations expand. Moving to Slide 7, Ingalls revenues of $664 million in the quarter decreased $47 million or 6.6% from the same period last year, driven primarily by lower volumes in the amphibious assault ships and the National Security Cutter Program, partially offset by higher surface combatant volume. Ingalls' operating income in the quarter was $49 million and operating margin was 7.4% compared to $73 million and 10.3%, respectively, from the same period last year. The decreases were primarily due to lower performance on amphibious assault ships and surface combatants. At Newport News, revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter were down $41 million or 2.8% from the same period last year, driven primarily by lower volumes in naval nuclear support services as well as the cumulative adjustments on the Virginia class submarine program in aircraft carriers, partially offset by higher volumes in the Columbia class submarine program. Newport News' operating income in the quarter was $15 million and operating margin of 1.1% compared to $90 million and 6.2% respectively in the prior year period. Newport News results included net unfavorable cumulative adjustments totaling $78 million, including $34 million on Block IV of the Virginia class submarine program, $16 million on the Enterprise CVN 80 and Doris Miller CVN 81 two-carrier contract, and $14 million on the refueling and complex overhaul of the USS John C. Stennis CVN 74. As Chris described, these unfavorable adjustments were driven by both the change in our assumption around contract awards as well as program performance challenges as we have not achieved planned performance improvements. During the quarter, some welder issues were reported publicly that we had previously disclosed to our customer. An initial assessment at Newport News shipbuilding determined that fewer than two dozen welders did not consistently follow procedures in their weld process. We continue to work alongside with the Navy through a comprehensive investigation and analysis to determine the extent of any financial impact. At Mission Technologies, revenues of $709 million increased $24 million or 3.5% compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher volumes in cyber electronic warfare and space. Mission Technologies' operating income for the quarter was $33 million and operating margin was 4.7% compared to $24 million and 3.5%, respectively, in the third quarter of last year. The increases were primarily driven by higher cyber electronic warfare and space volumes as well as equity income from nuclear and environmental joint ventures. Third-quarter results for Mission Technologies included approximately $25 million of amortization to purchased intangible assets. Mission Technologies' EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 8.9% compared to 8.2% in the third quarter of 2023 and 8.5% last quarter. As Chris noted, Mission Technologies' performance in 2024 has been very strong with year-to-date sales growth of 14%. This follows 2023 revenue growth of 13.1% over 2022. Mission Technologies' third-quarter contract awards, which entail new work and recompete wins across the service branches and multi-domain operations represent nearly $11 billion in total potential contract value, a record for Mission Technologies. Turning to Slide 8, cash generated by operations was $213 million in the quarter. Net capital expenditures were $77 million or 2.8% of revenues. Free cash flow in the quarter was $136 million. Cash contributions to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans were $12 million in the quarter. We have provided an update to our 2024 and 2025 pension outlook in the appendix of today's slides. The cash-flow impacts related to the updated forecast are quite minimal. Pension-related numbers are subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria. As usual, we plan to provide a multiyear update of pension estimates on our fourth quarter call in January. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 134,000 shares at a cost of approximately $35 million, bringing the year-to-date total to 608,000 shares at a cost of $162 million. With cash from operations now below our initial expectations, consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we have throttle repurchases for the remainder of the year. Also during the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $1.30 per share or $52 million in aggregate. Yesterday, we were pleased to announce an increase to our quarterly dividend to $1.35 per share, or an increase of approximately 3.8%. Moving on to our updated outlook, which we have summarized on Slide 9. We've increased Mission Technologies' revenue by $50 million for the year, now to $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion and increased their margin outlook to 3.75%. For Shipbuilding, we have centered on revenue guidance to the lower end of the range at $8.8 billion. Our prior shipbuilding revenue and margin guidance anticipated receiving an omnibus of submarine contract awards and contract modifications incorporating opportunities to address key shipbuilding structural challenges across the Newport News enterprise, focusing on investments in our workforce, aiding, attrition and training, and investments in our infrastructure, buildings, facilities, manufacturing, tooling, and aids for additional throughput and capacity across the Newport News portfolio. While we remain confident that we will ultimately receive the new contract awards, we are now uncertain of the timing and whether the overall contracting construct of those awards will enable full pursuit of near-term key investments needed to accelerate performance, rate, and volume of the Newport News portfolio of contracts. Our initial guidance for 2024 also assumed incremental program performance improvement consistent with normal expectations to capture learning curve improvements and production efficiencies over time. Performance has not improved at the forecasted rate due to workforce inexperience and delays with the supply chain, which along with our updated contracting expectation has a near-term impact on our ability to achieve progress milestones, burn down working capital, and collect associated cash. The results and updated outlook announced today reflect a reduced performance trajectory aligned to current conditions. Our updated shipbuilding operating margin expectation for the year is now 5% to 6%. Our updated free cash flow is between zero and $100 million and our capital expenditure outlay for the year has been reduced from 5.3% to 3.4% of sales. Prior guidance anticipated contract structures that would have allowed us to capture additional progress milestones as well as the inclusion of incentives related to the new contract awards. We expect to return to more normal free cash flow levels once we are able to work through the challenging portions of our current contracts and have a better understanding of the new submarine awards. In light of this dynamic, we are withdrawing our five-year free cash flow target. Beyond our operational guidance, we have also made modest updates to our outlook for pension-related items, interest expense, and our expected tax rate for the year, which has declined to 17%. The lower annual forecasted tax rate is driven by third quarter results that include an increase in the research and development tax credits for current and prior years, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 10% for Q3. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with liquidity of approximately $1.3 billion and modest leverage of approximately 2.1 times net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged, including our commitment to investment-grade credit rating, thoughtful investment in our shipyards, continued dividend growth, and the return of excess cash through share repurchases. Within the third quarter, we expanded our revolver from $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and raised our commercial paper program from $1 billion to $1.7 billion, consistent with our normal cost of business and given the more favorable interest-rate environment, we are considering a new debt issuance in the coming months. Proceeds would be used in part to support the redemption of the $500 million senior notes due in May 2025 and for other general corporate purposes. This plan is still under evaluation. Further to Chris' comments on our focus on cost-efficiency ongoing across the corporation, we recently announced the consolidation of Mission Technologies into four groups, down from the previous six business units, simplifying the division's structure around key growth initiatives while enhancing competitiveness by reducing operational cost. This more efficient alignment of the portfolio, talent, and resources will support continued long-term business growth. To close, I will reiterate that while our updated guidance removes the assumption of a near-term Omnibus contract agreement for the next increment of VCS and Columbia submarines, we continue to advocate for innovative and sensible solutions to address the urgent shipbuilding industry challenges we have discussed. We are confident in our ability to work through the current challenges and we will continue to focus on aggressively driving performance improvement in our shipyards, expanding capacity and throughput, and securing equitable contract solutions that address the business realities of the current operating environment. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Christie to manage Q&A.
Christie Thomas: Thanks, Tom. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so that we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Gautam Khanna: Yes. Hi guys. A couple of questions.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Khanna.
Gautam Khanna: Good morning. Tom, you mentioned -- it sounded like contingent on signing these new submarine contracts was an implicit assumption that you would get a lease on existing contracts that are in the yard and so I'm curious how much of the negative cum catch-up at Newport News related to that? How that impacts the ongoing booking rate? So I mean, it sounds like you were booking with this assumption in mind already. So I'm curious like what's the incremental hit was? And what was already established, if you will? And then so I guess that's my first question. And then the second one is related to the Wells rework. Just how much of the keen catch-up relates to that? And then I'll leave it for someone else. Thanks.
Chris Kastner: Okay, Gautam. Let me have -- this is Chris. I'll handle the first question and then I'll start in on the welds and Tom can answer it. But really in the quarter, we had two issues impacting us. We had performance and execution on the deck plate, really on these pre-COVID ships. And then we had the assumption really for the year the quarter and into the guidance actually relative to this 17 ship contract. I think it helps to get into detail a little bit on what happened in the quarter from a performance standpoint. And the largest impact was related to the Block IV submarines and you have 798 and 800 nearing some critical milestones where you're going through the test program and you're buttoning some systems up. And we just encountered rework on systems that we didn't expect and we have -- and that impacts schedule and we're having to roll through that. And that's really illustrative of what we're finding on these pre-COVID ships is there's unpredictability as you move into buttoning them up and entering into these major milestones, which creates this unpredictability going forward. On the 17-ship contract, we were making good progress, as I said in my script. And when you think about the 17 submarines, it's really a reset of the portfolio in Newport News. This is not business as usual. You can't simply just put that much work into a facility and expect it to be executed, especially in this environment that we're operating in relative to labor and the supply chain and the capacity in the industrial base. So we've been working very hard with the customer to try to get those 17 ships right. And it's a broad-based sort of a contract that we're working on that really unlocks investment in labor and infrastructure and technology across the portfolio. So we're going to keep working on it as it's -- we thought we were pretty close to getting it done. It's in review still and alternatives are being reviewed and we're supporting that conversation, but it's just created some unpredictability not only in the quarter and the year, but in our outlook and we're working through that. But ultimately, I can represent that when that when that contract is executed, it's going to be a fair and equitable contract. It's going to be broad-based and it's going to reflect the economic environment in which we're operating, it does none of us any good to agree to cost or schedules on these submarines that are so urgently needed that we can't achieve. So that's kind of what happened in the quarter, in the year, and in guidance. I don't think it's appropriate to parse it between our performance and what we thought was going to happen in the 17-ship contract. There was incentives in that contract that we thought we would realize that we just didn't. But I think it's tough to parse it between the two. On the welds, Tom started that conversation a bit and I'll let him talk about the financials. But really, this is a process issue. This is a small fraction of our -- of some welders in the yard and a small fraction of welds that were impacted. We're working very closely with the customer to bound the issue and come through the issue. And we think we'll march through that very smartly. So, Tom, do you want to comment on the financials related to that?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So as we proceed through the investigations and eventually close that out, we'll have a finality on the financial front. We have taken an initial booking. It's not material. It's not identified in the queue. It's just for the costs that we think that could be deemed unallowable on that. So we'll get you more information as we close that out and that's all I have to say about that. On that first part, I would just add, as Chris was commenting, trying -- the reason why we wouldn't parse out between performance and the -- and the new contract innovative approach, now that's still ongoing right now. It's in negotiations. There's optionality against that and we'll have to see how that plays out. So it's just -- it's not appropriate for us to comment at this time as we're trying to work and negotiate ourselves through that without any partner.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Scott Mikus: Good morning. This is Scott Mikus on for Rob Spingarn.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Mikus: Chris -- good morning. Chris, the press release and your opening remarks, you talked about innovative contracting approaches that incentivize greater investments in the workforce, facilities, and technology. Presumably, you're referring to the SAWS funding plan where the Navy wants to pull funding from boats that haven't started construction to support higher wages and infrastructure build right now. So just wondering if you could talk about your thoughts on the SAWS plan and then I have another follow-up on that as well.
Chris Kastner: Well, if the SAWS plan has kind of broadly reported, I wouldn't get into too much detail. You kind of hit the basics there. We support it. It was an excellent idea. It was a Navy initiative that we supported. I still believe it's the smartest best way to get at this issue because it unlocks such investment in the workforce, the infrastructure, and technology. We're still in discussions on alternatives with the Navy and the Congress in supporting and asking questions on alternatives. But that SAWS plan is a -- it was a very good idea that we think is still under review and potentially could be put under contract, although we don't forecast that happening over the balance of this year.
Scott Mikus: Okay. And then there was a letter from a bipartisan group of senators. It was regarding the SAWS plan, but it also mentioned that there could be a $17 billion shortfall in funding on the Virginia-class program over the next six years. I understand shipbuilding costs have increased significantly, but does a $17 billion shortfall sound remotely close to you? And do you think Congress will support plugging that shortfall?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So I'm not going to comment on the ability of Congress to obtain additional funding. The beauty of SAWS was you didn't need any more funding. So -- and I really don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on the baseline that was used for that -- for that increase. But look, the teams are working very hard to come to a contract solution on these 17 ships. We need to make sure that, that solution is equitable and reflects our current macroeconomic environment, and also enables initial investment so that we can get these critical assets to the fleet as soon as possible.
Scott Mikus: All right. Thanks for taking the question.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Yes, thanks. I was hoping you could talk and maybe give us a little bit of color on the $800 million cut to operating cash flow for the year. How much of that was specifically tied to the contract slipping out beyond this year? And how much was tied to performance? I know you didn't want to do that for the EAC, but given the size of the cash cut, I hope you can do it for this.
Chris Kastner: Yes. So let me start and Tom can step in. As you know, we really -- when we think through guidance, we risk-adjust everything. So it's really a combination of both the new contract as well as progress within the yards. So Tom, I don't know if you want to comment further on that.
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So we talked a little bit about this in Q1 and Q2 where we had a pathway to make the guide. And obviously, at that time, you could see on the balance sheet that the working capital was rising right there. We had talked about progress, progress, timing, making the major milestones up and out that we show you, the minor milestones and the incentives, both the capital and performance incentives behind the scenes. And then what we normally have, just the run-rate of unadjudicated change, change orders, REAs, and things of that nature and compositely between the recoveries, and the performance and the recoveries of those, I mean, that's how we pick up our margin and cash. So the pathway was clearly at the beginning of the year when we laid out the plan. And then in Q1 and Q2, we still had pathways from performance and from the investments that would come about with the 17 boats on that innovative contracting approach to be able to kind of hit our guide here. The backup that we've seen right now, obviously is twofold is the awards, certainly all 17 boats do not look imminent by the end of the year. I think we all know that. And then from a performance standpoint, we've been able to make progress, but not enough of the progress or the right progress and the progress timing is limiting us to be able to fill all the costs that are on the balance sheet right now. So we thought it was prudent to take the $600 million to $700 million guidance that we've had at the beginning of the year, bring that down to zero to $100 million. So again, it's a piece of the awards and that's a timing aspect. It's a piece on both the performance. Obviously, when we bring the 7.6% to 7.8% in margin for shipbuilding down to 5% to 6% this year, the less margin means less cash. There's a piece of so that's a piece of it -- there's a piece of timing where it moves from '24 to '25 and then there's just a piece of the operations here. So it's a mix of it, but we thought it was prudent after the Q2 call when we saw some headwinds on the innovative contracting approach being able to be pushed through and executed by the end of the year as well as the Q3's performance to bring down guidance on this call.
Myles Walton: Yes. No, and I get the moving parts. I'm just hoping because obviously, the timing piece is an important question, if it's timing or if it's performance and the contract, I think we could perceive some of that is timing. And so I would just ask, is it three quarters related to the contracts? Is it that high or is it not that high?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So, Myles, I understand the question. I understand it's the split that you're asking, but the interesting thing about that 17 ships is the construct of that contract right now, we just don't know. We've been in active discussions on what it's going to look like. I am very confident they're going to order those submarines. But we just -- we just don't know the ultimate construct of that. So it's just -- it's a challenge to break that out for you.
Myles Walton: Okay. Maybe the following question, I'll leave it is, so going into next year in terms of normalcy of cash generation of this business, what would be the framework that you'd suggest for thinking about cash generation of the business?
Chris Kastner: Well, I think it's going to be choppy for a couple of years, quite honestly, Myles. We're taking a hard look at all our expenses, our capital. We're relooking at that. But it's all going to be the indicators of cash, they are all going to be about performance and how that shifts, how that contract comes together, how we execute at the deck plate and proceed, and just how we transition into those new contracts. It's that's going to be the story from a cash flow standpoint for the next couple of years for us.
Myles Walton: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Yes, good morning, guys. I guess just on the Block -- and just on the Block IV charges, did the design change Did the Navy request it on the 800? Did they kind of -- did they pay you guys for that? Or did that for some of the negative EAC?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So it's both backed-up in the quarter. A part of that is the design change related to 800, there's probably some upside on that when that gets negotiated potentially. It's clearly a Class 1 change for work that needed to get done before we floated off. But that was not the only issue in the quarter for 800 and there could potentially be some upside related to that.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. And then just at Ingalls, it seemed like on the last call, you guys had a feel that things were going to improve imminently at Ingalls and it seems like they're largely in zero production down there. So I'm just wondering if you can categorize or characterize, is there pretty meaningful net attrition issues at Ingalls as well? Or why are things kind of going in the wrong direction there?
Chris Kastner: Yes, I wouldn't necessarily say they're going in the wrong direction at Ingalls. They do have the same issues that everyone in manufacturing is facing relative to green labor and they're working very hard to address that. The issue with Ingalls right now is there's just less opportunity for positive adjustments. You don't see significant negative adjustments, but you don't see significant positive either. So they're fighting through the same issues as everyone in manufacturing in United States fighting through relative to green labor, fragile supply-chain, but I got a lot of confidence in Ingalls' team. They're making their milestones and they're proceeding on their programs. And that bundle contract was very positive. It's really representative of the type of contract we need going forward to reflect our current macroeconomic environment, ensuring we protect ourselves against the risk of inflation and a fragile supply chain. So yes, I got a lot of confidence in the Ingalls team.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Good morning. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
David Strauss: Hi, Chris, in terms of -- good morning. In terms of the submarine industrial base money, all the money that's being thrown at this, where is it going? And are you seeing any evidence that it's actually helping at this point?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So the industrial-based funding really positive developments there from Congress and the Navy to flow that money into the industrial base, it gets distributed primarily in the supply base, but we benefit from it as well. And there will be benefits related to it. The problem is it just doesn't happen very quickly. When you're talking about potentially new tooling, new buildings, it takes a while to get that stuff done and then to reap the benefits from it. So we're actually rebuilding the industrial base related to shipbuilding right now and expanding capacity both through Navy investments as well as our investments. So I think it's a very positive development. I think actually, I know there's going to be benefits that come from it. It's just we're going to have to be a bit patient.
David Strauss: Okay. And as a follow-up, I think to Myles' question, Tom, maybe just going after with the working capital side of things, it -- I guess you're about 9% right now on working capital. I'm guessing your guide for the full year implies something like in Q4, we get down to around 6% to 7%. Is that right? And do you still view kind of a normal level of working capital around 5%?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So I think obviously you can calculate we are in the upper 8s right now and we are going to take a couple of 100 basis points to 200 basis points out of that by the end of the year. There's a range of variability between zero and 100. I do think once we get past these ships here, the pre-COVID ships, we'll get back to a normal range of cash flow. As Chris said, that could be 12 to 18 months by the end of '24 into '25. So we’re just going to have to work ourselves through that. We're making progress. The cost is there on the balance sheet. We just have to finish these ships up and get paid. The cash will come as we make our deliveries. So it's just a function of us grinding through the current portfolio of ships.
David Strauss: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Scott Deuschle: Hi, good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Deuschle: Tom, the low end of the shipbuilding margin guide seems to imply significantly more negative EACs in the fourth quarter. So I guess you see risk there. So my question is what prevents that risk from crystallizing other than getting the submarine contract? And then why not just book those negative EACs now if we're going to guide to them? Thanks.
Tom Stiehle: So we gave you a range for 5% to 6% for the end-of-the year. Obviously with the actions that you have for Q1, Q2, Q3, you can kind of calculate where that lands. There's a little volume against that, but generally speaking, there's still a spread there about 300 basis-points between the low-end and the high-end, 400 basis-points between the low-end at the high-end. And it just depends on how we proceed. We have Q4 performance, right? We have making progress and milestones, making those incentives I talked about the CapEx incentives and performance incentives on that and then kind of getting paid by the end of the year. On the cash side and the margin side, we're watching the EACs and finding a footing against the ships that we have here right now. So we wanted to make sure we had an appropriate range that had all outcomes. There's upside to it too as you see, between 5% and 6%, and we'll just -- we'll see how the year proceeds as we close out. We did wash out, as we mentioned in the scripts, the investment upside that you'd get as the investment dollars flow through here for the VCS and Columbia bill too. So that's not a factor as far as the year-end close-out.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. Thank you. And then, Chris, sorry if I missed it, but do you still expect to deliver CVN 79 in 2025? And is that pre-COVID ship seeing any issues or rework requirements in the testing phase like those you referenced on Block IV Virginia-class?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So no change in the milestones other than what I referenced on my script. We're absolutely impacted on all those pre-COVID shifts by additional rework and really the fragility of the supply-chain. We've talked previously about it at the kind of the variability in the supply-chain going down from an inflation and predictability standpoint. But when something breaks, when you're going through the test program, something breaks and you have to go reorder or you have to rebuild it, there's just arthritis in the system-related to getting that back, which causes schedule risk. So, yes, no change to 79 right now, but it's just going to be a challenge completing any ship that was done negotiated pre-COVID.
Scott Deuschle: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky: Yes. Thanks and good morning, everybody.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Jason.
Jason Gursky: Hi, Chris. Hi, I'm just kind of curious how you go about managing the business with this much uncertainty going on the start new contracts and just kind of how you're going to go about go about managing through this? And then I can't help but wonder if slowing down here for some period of time might be helpful as you try to convert some of your green labor into more experienced labor. So I'm just kind of curious, could we wake up someday and see that we just hit the pause button, let you guys figure out how to get this work done more methodically and we kind of restart it. Is that a bad idea? I'm just trying to understand how this gets fixed.
Chris Kastner: Well, so that's it, Jason, thank you for that question. And first, first of all, I don't think there's any backup related to the urgency that's required to get these ships delivered and we're doing all we can to get these ships delivered to the Navy. But you bring up a very good point related to green labor. And while we're on our hiring plan for the year, we're actually repositioning our strategy relative to hiring where we're reducing our reliance on green labor, we're just going to hire less. And we're going to focus on more experienced labor because we're just out of alignment or out of balance from an experience level right now, which leads to rework, which leads to inefficiency. And it's not good for anyone. So we're repositioning that a bit, which I don't consider that is slowing down. I consider that investing in the workforce so that you're more efficient and really aligning and that's what we're doing with our capital plans and our cost structure as well, Jason, is we're aligning those investments and that cost structure with what we think the pace of activity will be going forward. As I said previously, and it doesn't do anyone any good to have to meet your hiring plan and then not have supply-chain material there, right? So I think you bring up a good point. I think we have to be very disciplined in how we do that. I think we have to be really disciplined in how we put these ships under contract as well. We can't sign a contract and hope. We have to do that. We have to do it understanding the current macroeconomic environment, understanding of proficiency of our labor force, the fragility of the supply chain, potential for increased inflation, and all of the work that's happening within the shipyard. So you bring up a good point, we're thoughtful about it. We're thinking about it and we're making sure that we do it responsibly.
Jason Gursky: Right. Okay. I appreciate that. And then somebody has got to ask a question about Mission Technologies, right? I mean, that business continues performed well, nice growth, margin -- margins are doing well there. So maybe just talk a little bit about the next few years at Mission Tech, the pipeline that you have there, the outlook for book-to-bill, the mix that you have in the current backlog and kind of what you're chasing? And just the potential for book-to-bills, growth rates, margins, kind of just give us a share of mosaic for the next few years to think about that business. Thanks.
Chris Kastner: Sure, sure. Mission Technology is doing very well. I know they've grown at 14% year-to-date over last year, some really big wins, $11 billion of wins. The outlook for that business couldn't be better and it's broadly across their portfolio. The team just restructured their business to focus on where they think the higher-growth areas are you think about C5ISR electronic warfare unmanned or uncrewed vehicles. So they're doing very well. The pipeline is strong. The team seems to be very focused and I look forward to them performing over the next few years, consistent with the growth rates or even beyond the growth rates that we communicated at our Investor Day. So yes, very pleased with Mission Technologies. The team is executing very well. Tom, do you have anything to add on Mission Technologies?
Tom Stiehle: No, I mean, just to hop on the back-end on-top of the growth rate that we've seen this year at 14% year-to-date has been 13% from '22 to '23. So I'm excited by that. The efficiency that Chris talked about from six business units to four, we're leveraging the strongest leaders here of the portfolio, the talent, we're aligning to be even more efficient on new bids there from a rate structure. So I'm excited with what they're doing there as they're honing the business. And the align acquisition was in 2021 and each year we're finding opportunity sense to either take more cost out or get some additional synergies within the division and the interfacing within shipbuilding and the opportunity set there continue to grow and how we can leverage Mission Technologies' applications and tech into how we construct and support our shipbuilding. So I'm excited about the future. We kind of set that up with a thesis of 7% to 9% growth, 8% to 10% EBITDA. I know that first year was up 4% from 2021 to 2022, but as I said, the last two years have been 13% and 14% higher than the initial hope and the projection that we gave for a 7% to 9% growth. And it's nice to see a couple of quarters here where the EBITDA margins have themselves up. A lot of cost-type contracts over that. But as we continue to mature the portfolio and the relationships with the customers and additional contracts, there'll be opportunity sets to kind of build out from just 80% to 85% cost-type into other type of contracts and delivery orders against those bottle contracts that will offer opportunity sets for higher returns as well, more products and services than just engineering solutions and studies. So I think it's going well right now and I'm excited that it brings about a new line of customer sets, different avenues of funding. We talked at Investor Day, the opportunity sets we have there to go international, commercial contracting, Australia over to England, and with the office opportunity sets in front of us too that's hitting on all cylinders for us.
Jason Gursky: Right. Okay. I appreciate that color and best of luck to the rest of the questions here.
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Jason.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hi, thanks very much, and good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Tom Stiehle: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: So I wanted to ask --good morning. You mentioned doing more outsourcing and kind of hiring less. How do we think about how that affects your returns and cost estimates when more of the work is done with outsourcing? And when we see all this money going into the submarine industrial base and some of it going into kind of our restarting small and medium-sized shipyards elsewhere, should we think about a greater percentage of the work being outsourced going forward and kind of what does that mean for margins?
Chris Kastner: Yes, I think there's going to be a greater percentage of our work outsourced going forward. There is a premium related to that. And you're seeing that, that impact in the profitability of our current portfolio. Now, I don't think it's going to be a significant impact going forward on these ships because we pretty much made most of those decisions. But we will increase the industrial base and increase outsourced partners on our future contracting activity and we make sure we protect those potential increases in those targets. That's what I mean about when I talk about ensuring that our new ships reflect the current macroeconomic environment, which means you're going to outsource more, which means it costs more. So we will outsource more. We need to expand the capacity in shipbuilding. We'll do that, but we need on these new contracts to ensure we protect ourselves.
Tom Stiehle: I hop on the back end of that to you a bit. I wouldn't want you to like take away that we're going to significantly reduce hiring. The hiring, the training, working on retention. The backdrop that we've given you is that there's going to be additional growth in shipbuilding, right, from 3% to 4%. So there needs to be more volume and capacity, right? It's not out-of-the inability just for us to hire enough, but because of the top-line growing. So we'll be outsourcing what makes sense. And compared to maybe the inefficiency of some things we do inside we don't have the capacity to do it, all that goes into the business construct as we outsource. We'll in-source. There's teams that we can have pop into the yard, painters and welders at times on ships that they can pop in here for a month or a couple of quarters and help out as well. And again, if there's maybe a slight premium, a lot of times you don't pay like the benefit end of that. And then coming in here to offset the inefficiency we have of maybe schedule growth of the inefficiencies of the inexperience, some of the inexperience that we have in here. And all that's rolled into the EAC right here. So I see that as nothing but positive. Also, there's opportunity sets for us to do other things like operating centers, manufacturing operating centers. And that's in the mix. We're always kind of studying that. So we're not flat-footed here. We've kind of talked over the last two or three years since COVID about hiring and we were successful at that. We see the attrition is a draw here and now we're kind of pivoting to like, hey, the answer to that is more training, more relationships, and engagement with our new hires. And then where we need to supplement that, that's where we either outsource, insource, or look at other operating centers that we can team with, team acquire, things of that nature. So I mean, all that's in play on how we're trying to manage the business as we see going forward.
Seth Seifman: All right. Okay. And then maybe then to follow-up, you mentioned kind of that 3% to 4% annual shipbuilding growth. That target, I think was also based on the investments that you guys thought you were making with the elevated CapEx over three years. Now this year for sure, and it seems like maybe going forward, the capital plan is much lighter without the kind of capacity and productivity that would come from that capital spending. Is it still appropriate to be thinking about that sort of 3% to 4% top-line over the next few years?
Chris Kastner: Yes. Sure, absolutely, right? I wouldn't want anyone to see the signal of the CapEx has reduced for this year. We had guided 5% for the next three years from '24, '25, and '26 with '24 being 5.3%. So we prudently kind of hedged that back and we're managing accordingly because we want to see is it going to be an incremental approach or are we still going to do something more globally like an omnibus approach for the 17 boats that we have. But none of that work has moved out. Every year we replan our 10-year annual operating plan and none of that work has moved out of the plant. So the business, the value equation that we have, the specific skills and the opportunity sets we have with the growing Navy requirement, one of the 30-year shipbuilding plan, the five-year flight up, all that's in place here. As Chris said, we're trying to make sure that we marry the business environment and the headwinds that we see with both the labor needs and the supply-chain availability. We're trying to fairy home to fair and equitable contracts going forward that protects -- finds the right balance between affordability and profitability. So that has not changed the value equation of HII. It does mean that for the remaining part of this year, as we're trying to get rid of a little bit of the cloudiness and how that's going to play out and see the footing on performance take hold in Q4 and going forward. We throttled back just from a CapEx and cash position to be prudent in the short term. But medium to long-term, really nothing changes from what we envisioned and what we walked the industry and street through at Investor Day, right. That was a medium to long-term. We talked about three to five for medium and five to 10 years, the thesis of HII investment, and what -- how we see the business playing out has not changed at all.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thanks very much.
Chris Kastner: Thanks.
Tom Stiehle: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead
Ronald Epstein: Hi, good morning, guys.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Ronald Epstein: I think we've been kind of through this, but I'm still trying to get my head around back at the Investor Day when you guys gave your outlook, how could you not see this coming?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So it's a good question, Ron. You talked about Investor Day, it was kind of a broad look at the -- at the business and a medium to long-term take on growth rates and where we saw performance was going, and consistent with Investor Day, we said we had to get through these pre-COVID contracts. And our assumptions of how we were going to get through them were just a little bit too optimistic. So we're having to deal with it. We have a very good accounting process where we roll through our EACs every quarter and we have to -- we have to take an issue if it shows up. So it's not grossly inconsistent with the challenges we knew we had on these -- on these contracts that were negotiated pre-COVID. We're just going to have to get through them and transition to these new contracts that reflect our current environment.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then how should we think about margins into next year? I mean, can you talk about that?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So they're going to be -- we're not going to provide guidance until the end of January on that. And it's going to be a reflection of how we execute over the next couple of months, our expectations of execution for the balance of the year, those risk and opportunities. And then what we think that 17-ship submarine contract looks like, whether it gets awarded together, whether it gets awarded separately in the FY '24 votes, what that construct looks like and what the incentives are, look like on that. So we'll give -- we'll give that -- that information out in -- for guidance in 2025 in January. And those are the factors that will influence it. Tom, I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that.
Tom Stiehle: You kind of hit it. It's just going to be a function of the performance and then these new contract awards that we have going forward. So I think it's premature right now for us to kind of guide that. I mean, we give you a range to get out of this year and then we'll give you a perspective kind of going forward. We understand what's impacting us. We're throwing a lot of horsepower, internal investment on labor front and on the supply chain. I mentioned to your question on the Investor Day, I mentioned about you had to work off the existing ships, the ships that have been during COVID and post-COVID the last three, four years now. I know a lot of people say, hey, COVID is behind us, but the contract value that we brought in here was pre-COVID, and then with the loss of hedge and the experience and the fragility of the supply chain, I mean, the impacts are still real today, whether it's impacting the ship at the deck plate parts and labor, or it's just a cumulative effect of higher costs over the performance of the ships and boats as they ran through the three or four years of three years of COVID 9% plus inflation for a couple of years and now tightening of the labor market. Those are real impacts that we're kind of living each day. So if you recall, I broke that down. Hey, we got every year, we get rid of a couple of boats and ships that went through that. We start some new boats and ships and then it's about the equity of the new contracts that we bring home with additional backstops on clauses, more alignment on program schedules, and then the cost returns that we see would get cranked into the new bids and we'd find that overlap between affordability and profitability on the new awards. And there's a transition period of that -- the new portfolio replacing the existing portfolio we have here, but I think that's the color we have.
Ronald Epstein: Yes. And then maybe just one more question. I mean, and tell me if I'm just oversimplifying this, but it -- when you look at the commercial airlines as an example, they had a pilot shortage until they paid the pilots a lot more, and then the shortage went away. I mean, is it as simple in the yard just paying the shipbuilders more, and you'll get more talented people with more experience? And is there a way to work with the Navy to do that?
Chris Kastner: Yes. That's what we're -- we are working with the Navy to do that now. We've worked with them on some interesting projects relative to increasing the labor and we're seeing some promising results for that. So Ron, you're bringing up a good point. It's something we're working very closely with the Navy to address on a 17-ship submarine contract. We've done it at Ingalls already in some areas and we're seeing some positive results. So it is an oversimplification, but we think that is one lever you can pull to improve retention, improve performance, and improve predictability.
Ronald Epstein: Yes, it makes sense. All right. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Chris, I don't want to belabor this 17-ship issue, but I was wondering if you could elaborate on what the potential sticking points are here. Is it very basically that the cost per unit has gone up significantly versus what the Navy is prepared to pay, or had budgeted, or that you were trying to get sort of recompense on the older pre-COVID contracts? And what exactly is the issue here?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So fundamentally, the budgets that were established for those boats was a few years ago and it didn't really have the -- our current environment baked into the budget scenario. So that creates a risk, just that creates a risk in getting those under contract. But it also doesn't -- if we were to just kind of go business-as-usual to put those under contract, it doesn't address the significant investment that's required to meet the critical need for these submarine schedules. And so whenever you do something that's somewhat innovative and create an asset that can be used for investment, it just takes longer to get that approved. We still think it's the right approach. So it's a combination of both of the things you mentioned, which the budget was not enough, but it also doesn't unlock all the investment that we need to make in the industrial base to meet our contract schedules. So it's a little bit of a budgeting challenge, but also how do we attack this issue kind of holistically so we can accelerate submarine production.
Robert Stallard: Right. And then just a quick one for Tom. Mission Technologies in Q4, it looks like things stepped down. Is there a reason for that?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. We're being conservative right now on the way that plays out. A piece of the performance that we see here is timing. So -- and but we're still -- if you notice, we're raising the guide both on the top line and the bottom line at Mission Technologies. So there's no issue or problem there. We just let it play out. They've met or exceeded where we thought they landed each quarter and I'm feeling positive about that. But there's still another two-plus months to kind of play out here and I'm looking forward to providing some good news in February.
Robert Stallard: Okay. Thanks, Tom.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Mike McCormick: Hi guys, this is Mike McCormick on for Doug.
Chris Kastner: Hi, Mike.
Mike McCormick: Just a quick question on labor. I know that you talked about sort of the outsourcing and hiring goals, but can you just touch on attrition in the quarter? I know last quarter kind of said not really improving, but an update there would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up.
Chris Kastner: Yes, we haven't seen market improvement in attrition. That's why we're kind of repositioning the way we're hiring and focusing on less entry-level and more experienced labor because they tend to -- they tend to stay. So, yes, no meaningful change in attrition.
Mike McCormick: Okay. Thank you. And then just on CVN 79, I guess as we get through to 80 and 81, any comments on how we should think about sort of the margin profile, should we expect margin expansion on these ships there too? Just any color on that would be helpful too.
Chris Kastner: Yes, I'm sorry, Mike, I have a bit of a trouble understanding what your question is, but I think it was margin profile on aircraft carriers. And we don't give margin by program. So it's just not something we do, but I do -- I'm still very confident as a 9% to 10% business, we just need to transition out of these pre-COVID contracts.
Mike McCormick: Okay. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Thanks
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hi, good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Hi, thanks. Can you frame the timing at which you will no longer have pre-pandemic contracts flowing through your financials?
Tom Stiehle: And so it transitions out. I think between 24% and 28%, about 50% to 60% of the work is pre-COVID. And just depending on the pace and tempo of the new awards, you saw we got the -- we got -- if I break down the new awards post-COVID FY '23 on the destroyers, you saw Ingalls just picked up the bundle in Q3. We're talking about the 17 boats here for the last two on FY '24 Block V on VCS, the next 10 boats for Block VI and then the Columbia Bill II, and then CVN 75 RCOH, we're already on contract for a long lead on that and that comes in here from a construction standpoint, I believe at the end of '25-26. So it's two, three, four years out as it starts to meaningfully ramp and we switch over in a couple of years that there'll be more of post-COVID awarded jobs than there are pre-COVID here. So that's in the '27-28 time-frame where we swing over.
Noah Poponak: Okay.
Tom Stiehle: With more post than pre.
Noah Poponak: Yes, okay. Okay. And Tom, I guess just on the on -- you had a multi-year free cash flow framework for a while and talked about kind of normalized recurring annual levels. Is there any new way you're framing the recurring annualized number? I guess it's a little surprising you pulled that because you're showing you can toggle the CapEx by a not insignificant amount and you've referenced timing, although I guess if it's a multi-year window where the margins are just structurally lower from pre-pandemic contracts, then maybe not. So I don't know if there's any additional color you can provide on how you're thinking about the beyond '24 free cash?
Tom Stiehle: Yes, I can. I can. We did think about that, but if you think about the five-year guide and here we are at the first of the five years and we've got the $600 million to $700 million to zero to $100 million. So you can easily do the quick math and just say, hey, the all 36 is now like a $3 billion area. But it's so close-up front of the five-year run here. We really want to kind of get out of this year with actuals, see what's happening on the new omnibus incremental innovative contracting approach, see how that takes hold, the timing and the pace, and the investments on that. And we just thought it was better to take it off the table right now and we'll evaluate when we feel good enough that we give you a number that we can hang on right now. So we could have adjusted it and then it could either be higher than that or less than that depending on the pace and tempo of the awards and performance. So we're going to hold that back. I mean, we hold our guide knee, and dear, at times, you've been on the call with us for many years. We talk about our ability to meet or exceed our guide. We were on a good run there from a cash -- since we started this cash-flow perspective back at end of 2019 from '20 to '24, each guide we met or exceeded. And of course, we're missing it kind of big-time here this year. And we thought it was just more prudent for us to take a break, understand what we have here, see how the contracting landscape plays out over the next six to 12 months, and then we can revisit that in the future.
Noah Poponak: Okay.
Tom Stiehle: I would say to my early comments that I still think -- yes, I would say to my earlier comments that still the HII value -- investment value has not changed, right, the 30-year shipbuilding plan, the five-year 5F, our backlog, it's a pace and tempo piece on performance and throughput on the existing work and then it's the modification -- the new awards, as Chris said, is it business-as-usual or as we kind of look for additional investments in labor and capacity and throughput and our supply chain, which needs dollars, which will assist us as far as I mentioned in Q1 and Q2 calls, those new contract awards bring equity in terms of margin and cash for investments and they facilitate unlocking the value of the existing contracts that we have the funds that are on there. So it's a fairly decent swinger on changing the trajectory of performance, capacity, and throughput and the recovery and the improvement going forward and we just have to see how that plays out over the next couple of quarters.
Noah Poponak: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Noah.
Operator: Thank you. I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Kastner for any closing remarks.
Chris Kastner: Sure, thank you. To wrap it up today, I'd like to summarize that we remain focused on optimizing our operations, improving our cost structure in shipbuilding performance, and driving higher throughput. We believe the actions we're taking will enable us to stabilize performance as we continue to work through these ships. Thanks again for your interest and participation today.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2024 HII Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Christie Thomas. Ms. Thomas, you may begin.
Christie Thomas: Thank you, operator and good morning. I’d like to welcome everyone to the HII second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Chris Kastner, our President and CEO; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and CFO.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris Kastner. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Christie and good morning everyone. The HII team remains focused on executing on our programs and meeting our commitments to our customers. In the second quarter, our shipbuilding division delivered two ships, and our Mission Technologies business achieved another quarter of strong performance. The alignment of our products and services to the United States national security strategy continues to provide strong visibility to our long-term revenue forecast. To start, I'd like to discuss our results. Record second quarter revenue was $3 billion, up 6.8% from a year ago and diluted earnings per share was $4.38 for the quarter, up from $3.27 in the second quarter of 2023. New contract awards during the quarter were $3.1 billion, which resulted in backlog of $48.5 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $27 billion is currently funded. At Mission Technologies, we had the seventh consecutive quarter of record revenue with sales of $765 million, 19% over the second quarter of 2023. In addition to very strong revenue, Mission Technologies trailing 12-month book-to-bill is 1.15 and its new business opportunity pipeline is over $83 billion. Mission Technologies continues to offer leading-edge technologies aligned with the capabilities our customers need -- and this growth in a competitive sector confirms for us that our technology portfolio is ideal for today's market requirements. In shipbuilding, we remain focused on directing our resources toward meeting our delivery commitments to the Navy. Significant efforts continue in each of our shipyards to create labor stability, improve proficiency and increase capacity, all aimed at meeting our throughput goals. The long-term investments we are making in capital and employee development, coupled with Navy industrial-based investments will stabilize and improve performance as our portfolio shifts towards new contracts and our ability to meet scheduled projections and performance goals will support achievement of our financial commitments to our shareholders. In the second quarter at Ingalls, we delivered LPD 29, Richard M. McCool Jr. and are looking forward to launching LPD 30 Harrisburg later this year. Other milestones including the launch of DDG 129, Jeremiah Denton and the delivery of LHA 8 Bougainville have been adjusted based on workforce availability, the most efficient utilization of shipyard facilities and levels of system completion to support predictable downstream execution of future milestones. At Newport News, in the second quarter, we delivered SSN 796 New Jersey and continue to make progress toward our remaining milestones that are planned for later this year. During the quarter, SSN 798 construction team experienced a minor disruption to Massachusetts test program due to some equipment replacement identified during testing. The disruption has been resolved, and the team is back into the test program making steady progress. It does, however, shift delivery from late 2024 to early 2025. We are reaffirming our shipbuilding margin outlook for the year. And as we've discussed, we are already in negotiations and expect several significant contract awards by the end of this year, including Block V Virginia class submarines, Build II Columbia class submarines and additional amphibious ships. Turning to activities in Washington. We continue to see bipartisan support for our programs reflected in the fiscal year 2025 defense appropriations and authorization bills as they progress through both chambers of Congress. We are pleased that the 2 authorization committees have shown strong support for shipbuilding including support for additional advanced procurement funding authority for CVN 82, additional funding authority to support for Virginia class construction and a multi-ship procurement of Amphibious shifts. The Senate authorizers also included additional funding authority for LPD Flight II and DDG-51 Flight III ships. The House appropriations bill continues to support our major shipbuilding programs and notably includes investment of $4 billion into the submarine industrial base. We await Senate appropriations positions and the final outcomes will depend on eventual respective conference negotiations by the appropriations and authorization committees. Now turning to labor. Positive trends continue in talent acquisition as we have hired over 3,800 craft personnel year-to-date, which keeps us on track to achieve our full year plan of approximately 6,000. In summary, I'm confident that the teams' focus on the execution of the fundamentals in our programs positions us positively for the future and look forward to the second half of the year as we meet more milestones and deliver on our commitments to our customers and shareholders. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financial results. Tom?
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I'll briefly review our second quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 6 of the presentation, our second quarter revenues of approximately $3 billion increased 6.8% compared to the same period last year and represent a record second quarter result for HII. This increased revenue was attributable to very strong year-over-year revenue growth of nearly 19% at Mission Technologies as well as growth at Ingalls and Newport News shipbuilding. Operating income for the quarter of $189 million increased by $33 million or 21.2% from the second quarter of 2023 and operating margin of 6.3% compares to operating margin of 5.6% in the same period last year. Net earnings in the quarter were $173 million compared to $130 million in the second quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $4.38 compared to $3.27 in the second quarter of the prior year, representing a year-over-year growth of approximately 34%. Backlog increased slightly to end the quarter at $48.5 billion, up approximately $100 million from Q1's close. Moving to Slide 7. Ingalls revenues of $712 million in the quarter increased $48 million or 7.2% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher volumes in amphibious assault ships and surface combatants, partially offset by lower volumes in the national security cutter program. Ingalls operating income for the quarter was $56 million and operating margin of 7.9% compared to $65 million and 9.8%, respectively, from the same period last year. The decreases were primarily due to lower risk retirement on surface combatants, partially offset by a delivery contract incentive on LPD 29 Richard M. McCool, Jr. At Newport News, revenues of $1.5 billion were up $26 million or 1.7% from the same period last year. Newport News operating income for the quarter was $111 million, and operating margin was 7.2% compared to $95 million and 6.3%, respectively, in the prior year period. The increases were primarily driven by a favorable contract adjustments, incentives and volume on the RCOH program, partially offset by lower performance on aircraft carrier construction and the VCS program. Shipbuilding operating margin in the second quarter was 7.4%, up from 6.8% in Q1 of this year. We are pleased to exceed the shipbuilding margin guidance we previously provided for the quarter, and we continue to see significant opportunity in the second half of the year for margin enhancement. At Mission Technologies, revenues of $765 million increased $129 million or 18.6% compared to the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher volumes in C5ISR and cyber electronic warfare and space. A portion of Mission Technologies overperformance in the quarter was driven by material and work that may not reoccur on a consistent basis, and we have factored that into our guide going forward. We are obviously very pleased with the growth in the quarter, and we are raising the Mission Technologies revenue guidance range for the year by $50 million. Mission Technologies operating income for the quarter was $36 million, and operating margin was 4.7% compared to $9 million and 1.4%, respectively, in the second quarter of last year. The increases were driven primarily by higher volumes I just mentioned, as well as stronger performance in fleet sustainment. In addition, in the second quarter of 2023, we recorded a $6 million loss related to the sale of a joint venture interest, which also helps the year-over-year comparison. Second quarter results for Mission Technologies included approximately $25 million of amortization of purchased intangible assets. Mission Technologies EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 8.5% compared to 6.7% in the second quarter of 2023 and 7.7% last quarter. Turning to Slide 8. Cash used in operations was $9 million in the quarter. Net capital expenditures were $90 million or 3% of revenues. Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $99 million, consistent with the guidance we provided on the first quarter call. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $14 million in the quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $1.30 per share or $51 million in aggregate. We also repurchased approximately 250,000 shares during the quarter at a cost of approximately $65 million. Moving to Slide 9. We have summarized our expectations for the third quarter and the year. For the third quarter, we expect shipbuilding revenue of approximately $2.2 billion and shipbuilding margin of approximately 7.8%, with margin continuing to ramp in the fourth quarter. For Mission Technologies, we expect revenues of approximately $650 million and operating margin of approximately 2.5%. For the year, we are reaffirming our share building revenue and margin expectations. And as I previously noted, we are raising Mission Technologies revenue guidance range. We are also updating our interest expense expectation to $95 million based on the phasing of our latest cash flow forecast. We are reiterating our free cash flow outlook for 2024 of $600 million to $700 million as well as our five-year free cash flow outlook of $3.6 billion. As we have noted, we expect free cash flow to be weighted towards the latter part of the year, which is not unusual. We currently expect third quarter free cash flow to be near zero, preceding expected strong cash collections in the fourth quarter. To summarize, we delivered another quarter of strong year-over-year revenue growth and met our shipbuilding expectations, while Mission Technologies portfolio continues to perform very well. Additionally, we are pleased to raise our Mission Technologies revenue guidance and reaffirm our shipbuilding financial outlook for the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Christie to manage Q&A.
Christie Thomas : Thanks, Tom. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so that we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Christie. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Chris, could we start with labor. It sounds like you continue to have good traction on the hiring front, but it's not clear to me if you're net-net increase in your headcount to where you want. So maybe just touch on attrition, hiring goals, I guess, are good, but attrition goals for the year at both shipyards and if that's a meaningful driver to some of the milestone slip-outs?
Chris Kastner : Yes, sure. Thanks, Myles. Thanks for your question. Yes, we are achieving our hiring goals in both shipyards. So we think we've made significant progress on ensuring that we can get the people to execute the work. Attrition is not materially improving, but we're thinking about it more broadly from a labor standpoint, an execution standpoint, attrition -- excuse me, attendance and over time, both have recovered. We're performing well there. Our outsourcing programs are executing well and industrial-based funding is being applied where it's necessary to increase the industrial base. So it's not just labor. We need to execute on our programs independent of how attrition is working. We'll continue to work on our attrition issues. We'll work on salary, flexibility, recruiting in the right places. But we're having to go where labor is. We've got some interesting stuff going on in Hampton Roads, where we're actually creating manufacturing footprint in areas we hadn't before to attract labor. So we're thinking about it more holistically now. It's not just simply labor and attrition in order to meet our throughput goals.
Myles Walton: And in terms of this effect on the milestones, I understand the Massachusetts sounds more like a technical discovery are the Ingalls milestone slippages more workforce limitations driven?
Chris Kastner : Well, it's both actually. It's -- on LHA, it's just a significant amount of volume and labor and application of the labor to achieve those milestones. So we move that. DDG 129 is a little different. There's sequencing involved in getting to that launch, but also some impact related to labor. Now all of that is included in our financials and in our guidance, and we're comfortable with where we are.
Myles Walton: Okay, Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Mikus: Good morning. This Scott Mikus on for Rob Spingarn.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Tom Stiehle: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Mikus: Tom or Chris, I wanted to ask, based on the guidance, you need to generate about $1 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about your level of visibility into that cash generation? And then if possible, can you quantify how much of the fourth quarter free cash is tied to working capital that could move into early 2025?
Chris Kastner: Yes. Thank you for the question. I'll start and then Tom can finish it off with some details here, but I hate to give the answer of timing because it's just not specific enough for you all. But there is a lot of timing in the back half of the year for margin and cash. In order to achieve that progress over the back half of the year, we need to make our milestones and our ships, we need to achieve contract incentives, and it's not just one. It's -- we risk adjust all of our programs over the back half of the year to ensure that we can make guidance, and we have a line of sight to it. So yes, it is over the back half of the year. There is some timing. There's some unwind in working capital, but we do have line of sight to it. Tom?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. I'll provide some more color on that, too. Hey, Scott efficient question. It's not a comment from where we are right now. I mean we usually use cash at the beginning of the year. And we have guided both minus 200 and minus 100 for Q1 and Q2, respectively we find ourselves right now through the quarter -- through the first half of the year at minus $274 million. And this is broken, there was about $100 million that moved from Q1 to Q2 in a payment, and then we closed Q2 kind of missing a $75 million thing. So I mean, from performance and where we thought we'd be, we're kind of right where we guided. From a perspective, the year had to shape to it. It was back end loaded anyway. It was more back end loaded in 2024 than it was in 2023. When you get the Q and you can take a look at this comparison in there from 2023 over to 2024. And we're down operationally in cash about $28.4 million, and then we have another $54 million of CapEx that we're spending in 2024 over 2023. So that constitutes about $330 million down in 2024 over 2023. But again, in line with where we thought we'd be in the plan, the portfolio. I would tell you a couple of the milestones that you had at the end of 2023 that dragged into 2024, although it's only a couple of ships up to 2029, the excess -- 786 and then the launch of 788 all just brought that work into 2024 and created just a little bit of a draw on making kind of cost and progress and headway on the existing portfolio we have here. But the guides that have we provided zero on free cash flow for Q3, which has some variability to it. There's a lot of activity that milestones that you have on major milestones, smaller milestones underneath, capital incentives, the capital is a little bit slower than we guided. You guided 5.3% for the year. It was 2.6% in Q1 and 3% for Q2. But as that comes online in the back half of the year, the progress that we want to make to close out the work packages that are in play right now will allow us to fully fulfill all the costs that you see on the balance sheet. You can see the contract liabilities and ARP in there. So there's some net working capital that's going to burn it off sat down. We finished last year at 5% of working capital at the end of 2023. We sit just under 9% right now. And I kind of foreshowed at the beginning of the year that we were going to have this shape. And by the end of the year because of the capital incentives we've had, we'd actually have a little bit of an advancement. We'll work ourselves down to the 2% to 3% range in working capital. And that's aligned with our plan. It's aligned not only with the free cash flow perspective we gave you to $600 million to $700 million this year. But in the five-year goal, I told you that had some shape in two. And net working capital level exiting 2020 into 2025 is planned in the guidance that I gave you for $3.6 billion kind of going forward. So I think we have -- we understand where we are. We aligned with the plan that we had this year. The increases on the back half of the year between the progressing, milestones, incentives, capital incentives and then we have some new contract awards that introduced some alignment with the business environments that we have here that, that itself, it just at the beginning of those contracts, we anticipate them to be awarded if not at the end of Q3 and Q4, a little variability of the effect. Is that going to be lifespan Q3 or Q4. But it will -- by the end of the year, we'll have new awards that will assist both in margin and cash as well.
Scott Mikus: Okay. That gets into my next question. So I wanted to ask, just high level, a big part of the margin story, at least for shipbuilding is putting new ships and boats on contracts that have better pricing compared to some of your older contracts. So can you give us an update on how many ships and boats you put on contract so far this year? And how many you expect to put on contract in the next 12 to 18 months?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So we expect to put under contract over the next 6 months to 12 months and probably before the year expires actually another 21 boats with pricing that reflects the current macroeconomic environment. So it's a significant amount of work that we intend to put under contract over the back half of the year.
Scott Mikus: All right. I'll stop there.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead, Pete.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning. Nice quarter.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Pete.
Pete Skibitski: I did have a question on Ingalls margin. I know you've touched on it a little bit just because it's dipped here for the first time in almost a couple of years. The release talked about lower risk retirement on service companies. And I wasn't sure if that's kind of -- you've got some early DDG-51s in the yard and you're booking conservatively or I wasn't sure if that was -- if the DG-129 push out next year impacted this quarter. Can you maybe talk through that a little bit with us a little more deeply?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. Sure, I can start. I think you probably have a little bit of a compare issue from last year in that language. But obviously, you moved to two milestones, cost goes with schedule. So that impacted the quarter. And then 129 had a bit -- or excuse me, LPD 29 delivery had a little bit less risk retirement than we usually have. So Ingalls is going to continue to execute. This is just a bit of a quiet quarter for them, and I expect them to recover very quickly here.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. I appreciate it. And just one follow-up. I know some of the -- there's been some supply chain issues on the Virginia, I think -- and the carriers I think one of the issues has been development of the new electric generators. Do you guys have a time line of when that new system is expected to arrive in the yard?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So I'm probably not the right person to talk about that depending on what program you're referencing. We have -- our estimates have not changed for 80%, if that's what you're referencing. And our schedules have not changed materially either. They're making good progress on 80. They're doing some very interesting things relative to ensuring that we hold on to the schedule for 81 and how we're going to build those. But I'm not really comfortable because there's been no material change between Q1 and Q2 relative to those delivery requirements or expectations.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Tom Stiehle: Good morning, David.
David Strauss: Chris, can you talk about where you are in terms of Block IV, Block V work and then negotiating Block VI on ECS?
Chris Kastner: Sure. Sure. Block IV, we're marching towards delivery on 798. We did have that minor move on the milestone, but they're making progress on the test program now. And it's a good team on it. It's a good crew. It's a good leadership. So I fully expect 798 will resolve at the beginning of next year. 800s making progress. That milestone is holding the float off the back half of this year, and then we have one more module that we have to deliver to general dynamics. And then we're making progress on Block V and they'll start to fill in behind Block IV in those -- getting into the integrated delivery and test of the Block V Virginia class boats. Block VI, we're in discussions with the government relative to negotiation of that block. I expect that to resolve this year, working closely, I think it will be a fair deal dealing with this macroeconomic environment we talk about with inflation and supply chain insurance. We have all that risk protected. The good news is we're making investments, the Navy's making investments in the industrial base in order to get at this throughput issue and we fully expect it and when we do Block VI, all of that will be wrapped into that deal, and it will be a fair deal. So that's where we stand on Virginia class.
David Strauss: Thanks. What is your revenue mix right now between Block IV and Block V?
Chris Kastner: Yes, the vast majority of it tell if you have the details, but the vast majority of it is headed in the Block 5 now.
Tom Stiehle: Yeah. So we're at 95% complete on Block IV. And then of, I know it's not the exact answer to your question, but we're a 95-plus percent of the contract completed on Block IV and Black V in the mid-20% range. So -- and we're spending -- we crossed over about six quarters ago, that Block V has high revenue on Block IV.
David Strauss: Okay. Thank you. And then if you come a follow-up on working capital. Did I hear correctly? Now it's going to drop to -- you're saying 2% by the end of this year? Where does that go in 2025?
Tom Stiehle: So a couple of things, yes. We got -- I think the last couple of calls, we've been talking about that, right? And the -- for the 600 to 700 guys and we have the working capital is right now, the capital incentives pop in here, we will burn down the 9% that we see through Q2 to that level going forward, right, lower than what we traditionally guided to between 4% and 5% because of what's going on, on the capital front. We haven't guided both for free cash flow specifically for 2025. And I would be -- I don't want to get into specific targets going forward. But I will tell you that we're kind of on plan on that front relative to its implications to the five-year free cash flow guidance. And as we close out the year for Q3, Q4, a lot of activity has to happen and how that's going to fall with everything I rattle on how we're going to make the 600 to 700. I prefer to hang on to the exact working capital guidance at the back half of the year as we set the trajectory and the targets for next year on the February's call.
David Strauss: All right. Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Gautam Khanna: Yeah. Thanks. I have two questions. First, just on the Q4 cash flow, was there -- are there any major like lumpy events that you could -- that might actually move that number materially if they were to slip out. And relatedly, do the delivery milestone slips have any impact on that whatsoever? And then I have a follow-up.
Chris Kastner: Yes. So I would tell you the ramp that we're going to see here between Q3, Q4, again, we can certainly guided to zero for Q3, but that could be 100 to 200 higher. It could be 50 to 100 less there, just depending on how everything that I said earlier kind of falls out. But the ramp from now where we are to Q3 and Q4, it's a composite there of improved trade working capital between AP and AR, the progressing and closing our sales, you can see how the cost in the balance sheet, so just getting the right progressing as we make headway on schedule to be able to build all the costs. The major milestones add into that. We've talked a bit that, I think, we have a slide on the PowerPoint briefing that you can see the ones that we have to hit there on the deliveries. And then we work ourselves through both incentives and program contract incentives and then capital incentives. And then the new awards contribute that rise and lift on the back half of the year, too. So it's all of it. I don't think -- missing one milestone here or there is not going to drive the preponderance of the lift that we see kind of going forward. But we'll keep you informed, and we'll give you an update on the November call. And parts of your other question?
Gautam Khanna: Great. Thank you. And Chris, I was just wondering what's your appetite for acquisitions at this point, if you could just talk about that?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So capital allocation has been fairly consistent here for the last year after we started to pay down the debt. We like to be investment grade. We think that's where we need to be and where we want to be. We're going to continue to invest in our shipyards. We're going to pay a dividend. And then with excess cash, we're going to provide it back to shareholders, but we'll continue to evaluate M&A opportunities as they present themselves. And if it makes strategic and financial sense, we'll evaluate it and entertain it. So there's not really a change in our capital allocation philosophy.
Gautam Khanna: Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead, Jason.
Jason Gursky: Okay. Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me?
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Jason. Yes.
Jason Gursky: Okay, great. I think the operator’s struggling there a bit. And Chris, just a quick question first on Mission Technologies. You mentioned the trailing 12 month book-to-bill of 1.15 and the quantum of the pipeline that you have there in that business. I'm wondering if you can step back for a minute and just talk a little bit about the 1.15, when you can execute on that backlog and the pipeline that you have available to you? And what that means for growth rates beyond 2024. We are obviously off to a really solid start here in the first half of this year. I'm just kind of curious how this growth rate settles out over the next couple of years?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So thanks, Jason. We're still comfortable with our 5% growth rate in Mission Technologies. It was a bit of a conservative guide. We've increased it for the year. And beyond that, if we can execute on the $83 billion pipeline and the book-to-bill continues to be very good, it could be north of that. And it's really broad-based across the business that each one of those business areas is executing very well. I would like to point out that there's a lot of interesting things going on in Mission Technologies. This is the first time that the Navy is going to deploy Virginia-class submarine with launch and recovery all autonomously of REMUS vehicle. And it's not just an exercise, that's full deployment to see Elmore [ph]. It's a great product, and it demonstrates the kind of the man and autonomous and man teaming that we really think about provides a lot of value for our customer. So if they continue to execute like this, they continue to execute on that backlog, and they take advantage of that pipeline, it could be north of that. But we don't want to get too far over our skis. We're going to be relatively conservative, as you would expect for us to be, but I'm very encouraged by how Mission Technologies is developing.
Jason Gursky: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And then secondarily, just on labor productivity in the shipyards. I know you talked a little bit earlier during the Q&A session about attrition rates and hiring and all that kind of stuff, good stuff, which is great. But I think probably just as important, hate to those numbers is kind of the learning curve of the employees -- and I'm wondering if you have the ability, maybe just from a big picture perspective to talk about labor productivity, where you are today relative to maybe where you were pre-pandemic? Just wondering if we're still down relative to pre-pandemic levels from a labor productivity perspective? And kind of what analytics back over the next couple of years and maybe when we can return back to kind of pre-pandemic productivity. Thanks.
Chris Kastner: Great. So it's a great question, Jason. So productivity is not as it was before the pandemic. There's no getting around that. And it's related to the experience level of the team. Now do I expect it -- do I expect it to improve? Absolutely. And both teams in Ingalls and Newport News are making investments to ensure it does. And the SIB investments that you see coming out of the Navy are focused on that as well. It's not just infrastructure. It's targeted at the proficiency of the workforce as well. So I do expect it to improve. We're investing against it. We've done it before. We've seen it before, and I expect it to continue to improve as we stabilize moving forward.
Jason Gursky: Great. Thanks.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Pleas go ahead, sir.
Seth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much and good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: I wonder – good morning. In the slides, I think you talked about a reduction year-on-year in Virginia sub profitability. Should we attribute that to what's happening on Massachusetts? Or was the reduction in expected profitability on Block V?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So, I think that's probably a compare issue related to last year. There's no material issue that we can note related to that. It's kind of broadly across the blocks. We assess our ACs every quarter. We have to make an adjustment, we do that, plus or minus. So this is not anything individually material there.
Seth Seifman: Okay. So -- and I think you mentioned earlier about the carrier. So, with both the carrier and Virginia Block 5, there weren't meaningful changes to the estimated profitability?
Chris Kastner: No, not material enough to note. No. But we -- as I said, we assess our issues every quarter when we make those adjustments dictated by our evaluation in that quarter.
Seth Seifman: Right. Okay. Okay, great. And then just for Ingalls, I guess, should we expect profitability there to -- we've seen typically kind of solidly double-digit margin for angles. Is that something kind of going forward that Ingalls can still be kind of at the high end of kind of good shipyard margins?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So, we don't guide by shipyard, but I fully expect Ingalls to continue to execute on their programs very well. But yes, we don't provide guidance by our shipyards.
Seth Seifman: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
George Shapiro: Tom, I wanted to pursue a little bit the free cash flow needs for the fourth quarter. I mean, obviously, we can all do the arithmetic $973 billion to $1.73 billion. Now, if I look back, that's nearly twice what you've ever done before, the last highest year in the last five with $539 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, you've never had three quarters in a row where no quarter generated positive cash flow. So, my question is what has changed in the last five years in terms of contracts that you have or what to suggest such a dramatic swing this year from what we've seen before?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So, I think we have a couple of quarters that were negative. So we can catch up offline on that, George. But this isn't an odd year, I would tell you, it's backloaded, one. Two, I would tell you that pre-COVID, as we're executing these contracts right now, we have seen a draw in the schedules over the last three or four years. And that just changes the construct of as we get progress and collect costs and what we're allowed to bill and creates a little bit of a draw on that. We still manage it annually. And as you know, we've been pretty good at providing a five-year target back in 2019, providing a guidance annually for each of the years and we've met or exceeded that. So, I mean we're in the lane right now. We've actually increased that $2.9 billion to $3 billion, so we another $10 million at it. We've given the next five years at 20% more. So, we have pretty good visibility into the portfolio. It's a relatively -- I'm sorry? There's some feedback here. It's a relatively mature portfolio that's going on that we have here. So, we have line of sight as far as what we have to build, program plans, the expected costs and then all that rolls in once we come through our quarterly ACs into the guidance of free cash flow going forward here. It is backloaded. And as I commented earlier, I did a comparison, you could take a peek at Q there on what's driving that. A little bit more CapEx that we've seen. The last two years has been 26% and 24% of sales, respectively, and already where we saw the previous headquarter of last year, and that's going to ramp in the back half of the year. Last years capital incentives that come along with that. As we continue to make progress, the cost that you can see that's on the books and the balance sheet there, we plan to liquidate that and really drive that working capital, that's going to be the catalyst, the working capital coming down, milestones and deliveries and additional awards as well as on contract performance and capital incentives are going to drive the back half of the year. The guide of 3% was probably on the conservative side. We didn't want to say it could be $100 million to $200 million higher or $50 million to $100 million less. And we didn't want to provide a number that we leaned into for Q3. The events and criteria and milestones that we see have to happen are right in that end of September, October and November time frame. So we guided conservatively, which does make the Q4 look like it's a larger lift than it may be as it plays out.
George Shapiro: Okay. Just one comment. What I said -- what I meant to say, if I didn't say it properly on the cash flow is, there hasn't been -- if you look at quarter-by-quarter, there's been no time in the last 5 years where one quarter hasn't had at least positive cash flow of the 3. There's been several quarters with two, 2 have been negative, but not 0 in the third. A follow-up I had was, in Mission Technologies, the guide for the second quarter was like $650 million, you did $750 million, which is a $765 million, which was similar to the first quarter. And you had mentioned the material and that may drop down in the third quarter. Can you just be a little clear as kind of what actually drove in the materials comment that you made.
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So, on the material comment that I said in my opening statements, that was more applicable to Q1. So there was some sales that we had, which are not in -- we don't envision to be on a recurring basis. We're not included in the Q2 or the guide kind of going forward. The Q2 revenue that we had at Mission Technologies was driven by strong performance in C5ISR and CEWS. And we believe that will continue going forward. We have normalized out for the book of business on contract right now. So we know what contracts we have and we're executing, and we see the -- how we load that out, and we have a clear sight on expectations of the revenues for the last 2 quarters, as well as there is some -- there's still awards happen every month. And the -- even though we're in the back half of the year, there's several tens of millions of dollars of potential sales that happen on awards. So, we have to execute our plan that we have in existing contracts. Those awards have to play out. And we've guided pricely probably on the conservative side of where we stand. The run rate at Mission Technologies between the first 2 quarters at 750 and 765 is 15.15 on an annual basis, over $3 billion. We've conservatively taken the beginning of the year guide to 2750 up to 2750 to 2280. So let's see how it plays out. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Chris made a comment earlier about the growth. We saw some good growth in '21 to '22 at 4% from '22 to '23 at 12.7%. And then both Q1 and Q2, respectively has seen 20% and 18% growth. But we don't want to only guide here. Obviously, we've got to get the people in, win those contracts and continue some good performance. But I'm feeling really strong about the Alion acquisition, the business proposition that we set that MT would be a $200 million cash generated, which it is. And I feel really good about the portfolio of contracts we have and that pipeline growing.
George Shapiro: So just one last one. So why guide only $650 million in the third quarter?
Tom Stiehle: Well, I would say we have a lot of work to do going forward here. We don't want to over guide in this, and it's still a function of a couple of awards that will have a minor impact on the revenue for the rest of the year here.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much for all the color.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jordan Lyonnais with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jordan Lyonnais: Hi. Good morning.
Chris Kastner : Good morning, Jordan.
Jordan Lyonnais: Thanks. On CapEx, the sequential uptick that you guys had, is there a percentage or a portion of that, that you could give color on that you'd expect to get back from the Navy CapEx incentives?
Tom Stiehle : Yes. We always invest with our partner with the Navy on this. And depending on what the CapEx is and the timing and the value equation, what that adds and the design of getting in the yard, whether it's for operational here or maybe sales and things like a there's a mix there of investment. We don't get into that. I mean, that's just part of the business case. And I will tell you that any capital projects that we do add value, we get a return on our capital, and it goes into the business construct and how we choose which projects we bid, we approved and we execute, so I'd leave it at that. It was 2.6% in Q1, 3% in Q2. The guide is still 53% [ph] for this year with a 5% CapEx over the next three years.
Jordan Lyonnais: Got it. Okay. And then also to the contract at Deloitte one that's for Navy shipbuilding, do you have any sense of the scope for it? Or why like mission tax wasn't picked or you guys in general?
Chris Kastner : I can't necessarily hear the question. There's some feedback. Can you repeat that?
Jordan Lyonnais: Yes. So Deloitte, the one that was a $2.4 billion Navy contract for -- it seems like an HR contract on the Navy shipbuilding data?
Chris Kastner : Yes, I think they're supporting their identification allocation of investments to support where they should make investments. So yes -- we were not involved in that contracting process.
Jordan Lyonnais: Okay. Got it. Thank you so much.
Chris Kastner : Sure.
Operator: Thank you. I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Kastner for any closing remarks.
Chris Kastner : Thanks, everybody, for joining today. Before we go, I'd like to extend my thanks to the entire HII team for their continued focus, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the First Quarter 2024 HII Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would now like to hand the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Christie Thomas, Mrs. Thomas, please go ahead. 
Christie Thomas: Thank you, operator, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to the HII First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today on the call are Chris Kastner, our President and CEO; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and CFO.

 With that, I would like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris Kastner. Chris? 
Christopher Kastner: Thanks, Christie, and good morning, everyone. Today, we released quarterly results that were characterized by steady performance in shipbuilding and strong growth of Mission Technologies. We saw record first quarter revenues, reflecting the continued strong demand from our customers for our products. As we discussed at our Investor Day in March, we remain focused on delivering the advantage to all our stakeholders: Our customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers and communities. 
 Now let's turn to our results. Record first quarter revenue was $2.8 billion and diluted earnings per share was $3.87 for the quarter, up from $3.23 in the first quarter of 2023. New contract awards during the quarter were $3.1 billion, which resulted in backlog of $48.4 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $27 billion is currently funded. 
 Turning to an update on our shipbuilding milestones. In the first quarter, at Ingalls, we completed builders and acceptance trials on LPD 29, Richard M. McCool Jr., which led to delivery of the ship last month. At Newport News, we delivered the first Columbia-class stern, floated off SSN 798 Massachusetts; and completed acceptance trials for SSN 796 New Jersey, which also delivered in April. We were also awarded the advanced planning contract for CVN 75 USS Harry S. Truman's RCOH, and undocked CVN 74 USS John C. Stennis as part of its RCOH in April. 
 In addition, last month, we announced the first integration of an Australian company into the Newport News shipbuilding supply chain with the purchase of steel from Australian manufacturer, BISALLOY Steel. The steel will be used for training and testing to enable us to begin the qualification process for the incremental steel volume required for AUKUS. This is a critical first step toward an integrated U.S., U.K., Australian supply chain under AUKUS. 
 At Mission Technologies, we saw record first quarter revenue with sales of $750 million, 20% over the first quarter of 2023. In addition to very strong sales growth, Mission Technologies won strategic competitions in the quarter, including a $305 million contract to protect U.S. regional interest in the Republic of Korea; a $74 million contract to research, analyze and develop enhanced capabilities for vertical launching systems onboard U.S. Navy surface ships; and an order to build a REMUS 620 unmanned underwater vehicle for an international customer. 
 Now shifting to activities in Washington for a moment. We were pleased that the fiscal year 2024 budget cycle ultimately concluded in March. We saw continued bipartisan support for our programs reflected in the final Defense Appropriations Act, including funding for 2 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, 2 Virginia-class attack submarines and 1 Columbia-class ballistic submarine. 
 Additionally, the appropriations measure provided $500 million for advanced procurement funding for LPD 33. The final appropriations bill also provided funding for the submarine industrial base and large surface combatant shipyard infrastructure and authorized the Navy to enter into a multiyear procurement contract for Virginia-class submarines. 
 Also in March, the President submitted the fiscal year 2025 budget request now under consideration by Congress. The proposed budget reflects continued investment in our shipbuilding programs, requesting funding for 2 Arleigh Burke-class surface combatants, 1 San Antonio-class amphibious warship and the lead Block VI Virginia-class submarine. 
 Additionally, the budget request funds the first year of the 3-year refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 75 USS Harry S. Truman. The budget request also continues funding for investment in the submarine industrial base and research and development efforts for the next-generation large surface combatants, DDG(X); and nuclear submarines, SSN[X]. 
 From an operational standpoint, to access the skilled manufacturing labor, coupled with our supply chain experiencing the same labor challenges continue to impact our programs. In that regard, we hired over 1,700 craft personnel in the first quarter which puts us on track to achieve our full year plan of approximately 6,000. Also in the first quarter, both of our shipyards held apprentice graduations celebrating over 230 graduates across HII who are and will become the leaders in their crafts. 
 We continue to maintain our focus on workforce retention and development and are working closely with our customers and state and local governments to solve this challenging issue. We continue to use overtime, contract labor and outsourcing to mitigate risk and strengthen the opportunity for progress and schedule stabilization. 
 In summary, we remain focused on meeting our commitments to our customers, and we'll continue to invest in our people and our facilities to ensure we meet the demand we forecast for our products and services. 
 And now I will turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financial results. Tom? 
Thomas Stiehle: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I'll briefly review our first quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. 
 Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 3 of the presentation. Our first quarter revenues of $2.8 billion increased 4.9% compared to the same period last year and represent a record first quarter result for HII. This increased revenue was attributable to growth at Mission Technologies and Ingalls. 
 Operating income for the quarter of $154 million increased by $13 million or 9.2% from the first quarter of 2023, and operating margin of 5.5% compares to operating margin of 5.3% in the same period last year. Net earnings in the quarter were $153 million compared to $129 million in the first quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $3.87 compared to $3.23 in the first quarter of the previous year. And backlog increased to end the quarter at $48.4 billion. 
 Moving to Slide 5. Ingalls revenues of $655 million in the quarter increased $78 million or 14% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher volumes in surface combatants and amphibious assault ships. Ingalls operating income of $60 million increased 9% from last year, and operating margin was 9.2% in the quarter, primarily due to the higher volumes I just mentioned. 
 At Newport News, revenues of $1.4 billion decreased $72 million or 5% from the same period last year, primarily driven by lower volumes in aircraft carriers and the Virginia-class submarine program. Newport News operating income for Q1 was $82 million and operating margin of 5.7% were relatively flat with the prior year. 
 Shipbuilding operating margin in the first quarter was 6.8%, slightly behind the outlook we provided for the quarter. Our shipbuilding revenue and operating margin outlook for the full year remains unchanged. And as we previously noted, our expected shipbuilding milestones for 2024 are concentrated largely in the second half of the year. 
 At Mission Technologies, revenues of $750 million increased $126 million or 20% compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher volumes in C5ISR in cyber electronic warfare and space. Mission Technologies operating income of $28 million compares to operating income of $17 million in the first quarter of last year. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher volumes I just mentioned. 
 First quarter results for Mission Technologies included approximately $25 million of amortization of purchased intangible assets. Mission Technologies EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 7.7%. 
 Turning to Slide 6. Cash used in operations was $202 million in the quarter. Net capital expenditures were $72 million or 2.6% of revenues. Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $274 million. This compares to cash used in operations of $9 million, net capital expenditures of $40 million or 1.5% of revenues and free cash flow of negative $49 million in the first quarter of 2023. The use of cash in the first quarter was expected and was due to timing of collections. We reaffirm our free cash flow outlook for 2024 of $600 million to $700 million and our 5-year free cash flow outlook of $3.6 billion. 
 Cash contributions to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans were $10 million in the quarter. I would also like to note that we made the remaining $145 million debt payment on our term loan associated with the Alion acquisition in Q1. 
 Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $1.30 per share or $51 million in aggregate. We also repurchased approximately 223,000 shares during the quarter at a cost of approximately $62 million. 
 To summarize, we delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, driven by Mission Technologies and Ingalls, and expect Newport News volumes to ramp up throughout the remainder of the year. In addition to its very strong sales, Mission Technologies continued to win new contracts and has a robust opportunity pipeline that has grown now to $80 billion. 
 We're off to a solid start for the year in revenues and operating income. And as typical, we expect free cash flow to ramp up throughout the year. Looking forward, we are confident in reaffirming our 2024 outlook and our 5-year free cash flow outlook of $3.6 billion. 
 Before I end my remarks, I'd like to thank you again for attending and for watching the webcast of our Investor Day on March 20. Chris and I and the HII leadership team appreciated the opportunity to showcase the details of our strategy, investment thesis and financial plans. 
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Christie to manage Q&A. 
Christie Thomas: [Operator Instructions] Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. 
Scott Deuschle: Chris, sorry if I missed one. Where is CVN 79? Yes, where is CVN 79 at in terms of percent complete? 
Christopher Kastner: It's right around 90%. It's progressing well. They're into the test program. We're actually seeing dead loads fired off [ malls ] off the ship. So that's a positive sign. So yes, they're progressing very well. 
Scott Deuschle: Okay. And then, Tom, to hit the midpoint of the shipbuilding margin guide, it looks like you'll need to do second half margins about, I guess, 150 basis points above the first half. It sounds like it's driven by better milestones. Maybe you can just walk through in a bit more detail as to where that uplift comes from. 
Thomas Stiehle: Yes. So we do have -- thanks Scott, appreciate the question. And we do have a shape of our margin, and it's backloaded in the year because of the milestones. And we guided to 7%. We came in at 6.88%, just a little light on the margin there. And then on the operating income, the sales being under Q2. But timing on that cost and labor is here, working ourselves to progressing on that front. But on the back half of the year, as we make our milestones, I do anticipate a ramp. We're guiding for Q2 to be a 7% quarter as well in shipbuilding. And then obviously the back half of the year, we'll kind of lift that up. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. 
Robert Spingarn: Chris, just going to touch on the labor situation, but the Navy controller was saying recently that the Navy just can't simply buy its way out of programmatic challenges and delays. And I assume that has to do the delays, of course, we've talked about this a lot, are just driven by labor constraints. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on that. And is there any possibility that maybe some subsidies to shipbuilders might relieve the situation? 
Christopher Kastner: Yes. That's interesting. Obviously, subsidies would help. More important than that is that some of the industrial-based funding that's been appropriated in '24, where there's real line of sight on projects that are going to improve performance within the industrial base, in the supply chain, in the labor force and in capacity. So I think that, that targeted effort by the Navy and the shipbuilders to identify spaces where we can make investments and get improvements is appropriate, and the teams are working very hard to do that. 
Robert Spingarn: So it sounds like it's really then not just labor. There are these other things you can do. 
Christopher Kastner: Well, there are other things you can do. But labor is the primary issue, is manufacturing labor in the United States and then shipbuilding labor in the United States. Simply the amount of labor that's necessary to build the ships, the access to labor and then the labor rates that we need to develop to be able to access more labor. We're working very hard on the apprentice schools, in workforce development with the State of Virginia and Mississippi and the community colleges. 
 And it's really kind of a change in approach relative to ensuring that manufacturing labor is a good job and a good-paying job that people want to do coming out of high school. So I don't think it's a one size fits all sort of solution to this. But labor is, I believe, the most contributing factor. And when you think about the supply chain, it's labor in the supply chain as well. So manufacturing labor is definitely a priority that needs to be fixed for the nation, I believe. 
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then just quickly on Mission Technologies. Andy had real good sales in the first quarter here ahead of the guidance run rate. So I was just wondering if we could talk about what's expected for the rest of the year there. What drove the quarter? And then do we fade a little bit in the rest of the year? Or is that just being conservative? 
Thomas Stiehle: So Rob, I'll give you some color on that. Yes, it was a strong quarter. Again, it came in at $750 million, following Q4 last year at $745 million. That we are being conservative in the guide, it's still holding it at $2.7 billion to $2.75 billion. I mean, if you do the quick math, the run rate for the remaining of the year is $650 million and holding to the guide there at the midpoint. 
 There is opportunity, I think, for him to do better than that, but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. It's about awards that he has in the plan this year, changing contracts that we have that we have backlog on those contracts into sales, and then him continuing his team to continue to stay on his labor plan and his hiring in that. So I do think there's some potential tailwinds on that front, but we'll just have to let the year play out. 
 Right now, I'm really comfortable. We saw -- we finished last year at 13% growth from '23 over '22. And then the you see a quarter here where it's over 20% quarter-over-quarter. So a fantastic start to the year. And he's got -- his pipeline has grown from $60 billion to $80 billion. So the opportunity set and scope of what's in play there has grown as well. So I'm looking for a strong back half of the year here from MT, but we'll have to see how it plays out. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. 
David Strauss: Chris, I wanted to ask you, you've now in Q1 and Q2, you're going to knock off a lot of these milestones that were supposed to happen late last year. But at the same time, we really haven't seen any of that perceived upside come through in terms of the margins based off of what you did in ship -- for shipbuilding in Q1 and what you're forecasting for Q2. So if you could just square that, why we're not seeing some of that upside that we would think would be there would come -- that is not coming through with these milestones being completed. 
Christopher Kastner: Yes. Well, no doubt that when you miss milestones and you extend schedules, there's going to be additional cost. So unfortunately, as we came through those amidst the end of the year and then got them done, 798, we floated off in the first quarter, we got the 2 deliveries in the second quarter, and there's just less opportunity. So yes, unfortunately, schedule equals cost, we've got to make our milestones. 
 You think of the balance of the milestones in the year, they're all holding. I would say the VCS milestones for the back half of the year are going to be a challenge, but the team is committed to getting those done, and they're holding now. But that's why we give you the milestones, you can get a barometer of how we're executing. 
David Strauss: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Tom, could you maybe -- I mean, you guided for free cash flow burn in Q2. Is it -- I mean, it seems like obviously going to be a very back-end loaded year. How should we think about the pacing of the CapEx step-up? We didn't really see it in Q1. So when do we really start to see a pickup in CapEx, and then what I would assume would be a big working capital recovery on the other side? 
Thomas Stiehle: Yes. So from a cash perspective, we came in at $274 million here. We're guiding another minus $100 million. So we'll work ourselves through that. Not uncommon, we burn cash at the beginning of the year, and not unanticipated here. Yes. So we wanted to make sure everyone's aligned with us on that front. 
 From a CapEx perspective, we spent 2.6% of sales in the first quarter here. And as we get into those projects this year, we'll ramp on the back half of the year. So we held the guidance at 5.3% of CapEx of sales for the entire year, and you'll see that ramp as we get into the back half of the year here. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. 
Douglas Harned: There has been -- and the Navy has commented on the Columbia-class issues with the work on the bow at Newport News. Can you comment on that in terms of what the status is and how that can affect your work flow on Columbia-class? 
Christopher Kastner: Sure. So yes, widely reported on that issue. The team has come through the first-of-class issues on the bow that impacted the schedule. Those are essentially behind us now. And then there's just -- now there's volume work to get the bow complete. We're actually a bit ahead of schedule to the recovery plan. The team is very focused on it. It's really our top priority, it's the top priority of the Navy. So unfortunate that we encountered those first-of-class issues, but we think the specific issue that drove the schedule delay is behind us at this point. 
Douglas Harned: Okay. Good. And then on Virginia-class, the -- you talked about the milestones this year. What I'm trying to understand is kind of where everything is in the flow in terms of eventually getting to that 2 deliveries per year level. And you had this letter come out of the House with a lot of members of Congress arguing that there should be 2 Virginia-class in the 2025 budget, the President's budget. But does that matter? 
 In other words, what I'm trying to understand is getting to 2 looks difficult right now. Does it matter to have the second one in the 2025 budget? And where do you stand on that pathway to get to 2 when you look at the milestones ahead here? 
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So I'll tell you, there has been incremental improvement as we move through the first part of the year on improving the rate on the VCS program. It's not good enough. There needs to be additional improvement. 
 In regard to the budget, I think the most important thing relative to the discussion on 1 or 2 boats procured in '25 is the signal it sends to the supply chain, is we need to make sure that we buy a full boat of materials, we keep the supply chain healthy so that we eliminate that risk for them. 
 The last thing we want to do is create risk on the -- within the program. So I think we've communicated that with the customer, and the Congress, they understand it. And as you know, we're just at the beginning of the budget discussions. So ultimately, we expect it to get resolved. But it's very important that we get the supply chain under order for both of the boats. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein from Bank of America. 
Mariana Perez Mora: This is Mariana Perez Mora on for Ron today. So the first question is going to be related to Australia. As you see this first order for steel delivery from an Australian company, how should we think about, like in the near term, you benefiting from like this early investment to actually make the Australian submarine supply chain stronger? 
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So that's an excellent question. This is, from an AUKUS standpoint, as I previously indicated, we view this as an opening of two markets for us. So it's a really good opportunity for us. And we think we're taking all the right steps to prepare for ultimately a pretty material impact to the corporation. 
 This is a really critical first step because we're flexing muscles in our supply chain to qualify a vendor in Australia that will ultimately potentially be part of the supply chain. We could start -- we're starting small, but it will ultimately grow from here to make them a sovereign-ready submarine provider. 
 So this is just the first step. I don't believe material revenue will flow from this immediately, but it's an important step to be prepared for us to support Australia. 
Mariana Perez Mora: Perfect. And also in the line of AUKUS, there has been talks that South Korea would like to join this trilateral agreement. If that goes through, how do you see this impacting the potential of the program demand and even supply chain environment? 
Christopher Kastner: Well obviously there would be further upside related to that. I think there are discussions about that, but I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Let's focus on AUKUS at this point, and I'll leave those sort of discussions to the Pentagon and the Navy. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from TD Cowen. 
Gautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could give us the EACs by segment in the quarter? Then I have a follow-up. 
Thomas Stiehle: Okay. Yes. So it was $53 million up, $51 million down for net $2 million. And the makeup of that was Ingalls was positive $13 million, Newport News was the negative $12 million, and MT was $1 million. 
Gautam Khanna: Okay. At NNS, the margins were a little light of our expectation. I'm just curious, any stepbacks in productivity or labor to speak of broadly at NNS or elsewhere? 
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So I'll start and then Tom can jump in. Yes, as you know, Gautam, we evaluate our EACs every quarter, and we have to take step-ups or step-backs. We do that, none more material in nature. But you saw the slip of the milestones which impacted some programs. So there were minor step-ups and step-backs throughout. 
Thomas Stiehle: But nothing material on that... 
Christopher Kastner: Yes, nothing material. 
Thomas Stiehle: I'll comment, too, here. So yes, 6.8% versus guidance of 7.0%. A year ago this quarter, it was 6.7% push [indiscernible], so not that far off. From a Newport News perspective, again at 5.7% for the quarter. A year ago, there were 5.6%. We finished off last year at 6.2%. So slightly off of that, just working through getting that production line working, material and labor on deck plate at the same time, trying to get that rework down and keeping the production line going here. So we're fighting through it. And really not that far off the guide, so -- okay. 
Gautam Khanna: Yes. And then just lastly, on LPD 29, was that EAC taken in the first quarter? Or was the delivery actually in the second quarter, and therefore it's more of a second quarter event? 
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So we obviously assess the EACs in the first quarter, but it's a second quarter event. And it's included in our guide for the second quarter and our expectations for the second quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. 
Seth Seifman: Tom, just first a quick clarification. I know you mentioned the CapEx really stepping up in the second half along with the cash generation. So I assume you're also expecting a step-up in the Navy support for that CapEx in the second half-plus. 
Thomas Stiehle: It's aligned. It's all baked into the plan we have and the guidance that we give, yes. 
Seth Seifman: Right. Okay. Okay. And then just on the margin rates in the shipyards, Q1, similar to last year, slightly higher. Q2 though, around 7%. Like if we look at the Q1 margin rates, kind of seems probably at the lower end of what you might expect for each of the yards. And so would normally expect some sequential improvement in each of the yards, maybe to something like above 6% at Newport, and I mean, Ingalls is often in the double digits. Is there something to be aware of that weighing on margins in the second quarter? Or is it -- I know you mentioned one milestone, but maybe a lack of overall milestones that's driving the 7% for the second quarter? 
Thomas Stiehle: So it's tough to look at the margin rates from quarter-to-quarter, and we do try and forecast so that you can land about where we think that we will be. Behind the scenes is the maturation of where we are on EACs, where the milestones are going to fall, where we see the potential risk burned out, so we've been taking the step-ups in the booking rates. And it's just the first half of the year. 
 We've had this for a couple of years now, that the first half of the year is lighter than the back half. Obviously, the major milestones, the deliveries and the launches are back half-loaded, so we expect to see that there. I'm not surprised on where we are. A couple of tenths here or there is not a huge deal overall. And we're working through our risks and opportunities going forward here. 
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. 
George Shapiro: Yes. Just following up a little bit on Seth's comment, but trying to get into some more detail. To get to the low end of your 7.6% margin guide for shipbuilding for the year would imply something like 8.3% or 8.4% in second half margins, which would imply an incremental $70 million to $75 million in profit. Are the milestones that you're projecting for the second half going to give us all that $70 million to $75 million? Or is there something else? 
Thomas Stiehle: It's a mix of the milestones that we have, incentives, all the aspects that we have and burning down risk. So all that plays out. I will tell you from a margin perspective, if you look over the last 3 years, right, whether it's shipbuilding at 7.7%, 7.7%, last year it was 8.3%. Even when you take the claim out, that we had that recovery, it was 7.5%. From a Newport News perspective, which is the preponderance of where the risk is right now, we were 6.2%, 6.1%, 6.2%. 
 So that margin rate has been stable. What we're talking about is a lift here kind of going forward. And as long as we stay on pace, the tempo of hiring, material and the cost efficiency, as we've said in the past, we expect that incrementally to improve annually here. So we'll keep you informed. Right now, 6.8% versus 7.0% is pretty much on top of what we thought we'd expect, and we're guiding to 7% right now, yes. So the back half of the year, George, will be a lift. 
George Shapiro: Okay. And a follow-up, a different question on the working capital. I mean, receivables were up like $253 million, contracts assets up $124 million in the quarter. That was well above last year's first quarter. So can you just kind of talk as to what caused it? 
Thomas Stiehle: Yes. So it's the working capital, it's timing, it's trade working capital between the billings and the receipts, the AR and the AP that we have right now. We have the cost in hand. At times, it's either making the progress or being able to bill, working ourselves through incentives for collections as well as progress restrictions that we have. 
 So a little bit higher than we guided to at minus $200 million here and minus $400 million for Q2. Not uncommon, like in 2022, where we ran the first 3 quarters in a deficit in cash, and then we came back strong in Q4. So we're watching that closely, and I think we're on plan right now going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. 
Myles Walton: I was wondering if I could ask a question first on the milestones as it relates to -- I know you don't size them individually, but there's not a milestone chart in the slide deck, so I just was looking to refresh. The Massachusetts, is that the most important milestone for this year for Newport News? And also any of the '25 milestones you had in the deck last time, have those shifted at all? 
Christopher Kastner: No, '25 has not shifted, and all the milestones are important. It is critical on the VCS program, that they meet their commitments because it is an assembly line and you need to roll crews to the next boat. So yes, those VCS milestones are important. 
Myles Walton: Okay. And then on the supply chain, I guess, some of the testimony emerging, I was talking about merchant suppliers of propulsion systems for ships. And I'm curious, Chris, if you just give us a little baseline of where you are in terms of the whack-a-mole game here of containing issues? And is it supplier component? Is it workforce? And I know you're going to say all of them. But maybe you can just give a little bit more color as the Navy Secretary was willing to offer up Northrop as a source of issues is a little bit of an incremental step in the direction of emerging of where the supply chain constraints might be. 
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So thanks, Myles. Workforce is a significant issue. We think we've solved the hiring part of that issue. We've hired over 1,700 in the quarter to our commitment of -- or to our goal of 6,000, and we're working very hard on attrition. There are some pilot projects that we have within each of the organizations, each of the shipyards, relative to attrition surrounding pay, where you recruit from and flexibility. Those are starting to yield some fruit, but not enough where I can really take it to the bank. So some positive indicators, but not good enough yet and we're going to continue to work on it. 
 From a supply chain standpoint, we are being impacted by some major equipment within a number of our programs. The overall supply chain is definitely more stable than it was a couple of years ago and even 12 months ago, but some of our major suppliers are impacting the erection of our ships, and we're working hard to resolve that with those subcontractors. 
Myles Walton: Okay. Is it concentrated to just a couple? Or is this really widespread? 
Christopher Kastner: No. Let's say 2 to 5. 
Operator: Our last question comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. 
Noah Poponak: Tom, you've referenced with the shipbuilding margin kind of being essentially flat year-over-year and have close to the guide in the quarter. But -- and I understand and appreciate all that and how it can move around quarter-to-quarter. But I guess, last year, the full year did come in below the original full year outlook, and you've cited the movement of milestones out of the end of the year into the beginning of this year. I guess, maybe could you frame it as your level of visibility into the back half milestones this year compared to what you saw when you sat there at this time last year? 
Thomas Stiehle: I think both years kind of near or pretty closely expectations, both from where we were on the margin side and the cash that's going to follow that. So it is a year where there's more milestones in the back half. It will be highly dependent that we get those done. Last year, the 3 events kind of slipped right from Q4 into Q1 and essentially at the very beginning of Q2. 
 So we had talked about staying attentive to us making our schedules. 2, 3, 4 months slip, although we don't like that, it's not huge. And I think the milestones we have right now, we have plans in place to make it by the end of the year, but there's risk on a couple of them. So we'll just have to see how that plays out here. I think it's going to -- near is a very similar profile year as 2023. 
 As far as your comments about kind of missing, last year, we guided in the upper 7s. We finished 8.375%. I tell you, the year before that, it was a couple of ticks off, too, a couple of tenths. So I think the guide is realistic, we have a plan in place to hit it, and it's just about execution here now with 8 months to go in this year. 
Noah Poponak: Okay. Makes sense. And how should we think about the pacing of the buyback through the year? And I guess also, what's the minimum cash balance, just given the shape of the free cash flow through the year? 
Thomas Stiehle: Yes. So we did buy back $62 million in the first quarter. We talked about a target of $300 million by the end of the year. So you can do the math on that. That will -- that should ramp up as we go through the back half of the year. We follow a very disciplined buying grid. We have algorithms against that where we see value. So we'll continue to employ that process. It has served us well. We reiterated our targets, so I don't see a change in that going forward right now. 
 And then from a minimum on the cash balance, it's not per se a minimum. From time to time, we will dig into our revolver or our commercial paper. So that's not uncommon, we've seen that in the past here. And as we're into the seasonality of Q1 in the first half of the year, being cash users, that's not a concern or a problem right now. So there isn't like a threshold or a minimum balance of cash that we have that would tie to being opportunistic and seeing value in the repo. So they're kind of independent. 
Noah Poponak: Got it. And Chris, you've touched on labor and attrition here. I think at the Investor Day, you quantified that attrition improved around 20% last year. It sounds like that continues to get better. I don't know if there are any numbers you can put around how much better that needs to get to be kind of fully normal or stable, or what you've seen year-to-date? 
Christopher Kastner: Yes. We don't publish our target there. It's definitely not back at pre-COVID levels, so we still need to improve our performance from a retention standpoint. 
Operator: I am not showing any further questions. At this time, I would now like to hand over to Mr. Kastner for any closing remarks. 
Christopher Kastner: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in HII, and we will continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business in support of our customers. Have a good afternoon. 
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

Christopher Kastner: Thanks, Christie, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. 2023 was a strong year for HII. We continue to invest both in our shipyards and in [IRAD] to both expand capacity and develop new products and solutions for our customers. Our growth rate for the year of more than 7% and our free cash flow generation of almost $700 million demonstrate that we're entering a period of accelerated growth and increased free cash flow generation. In addition to record sales growth with 2023 revenues of $11.5 billion, fourth quarter revenue was especially strong across all three divisions, with 13% year-over-year growth and a record $3.2 billion of revenue. In 2023, net earnings were $681 million, 18% higher than the prior year and strong free cash flow of $692 million was 40% higher than 2022. We also had $12.5 billion of contract awards in 2023, resulting in backlog of $48 billion at year-end. At Ingalls, we delivered DDG 125 Jack H. Lucas, the first Flight III ship and NSC 10 Calhoun. Our DDG 51 team was also awarded the contracts for seven destroyers in the FY '23 multiyear procurement competition. In our amphibious ship programs, we were awarded a $1.3 billion detailed design and construction contract for LPD 32 and launched LHA 8 Bougainville, the third big deck amphibious warship in the America class. Ingalls expects to complete sea trials and deliver LPD 29, Richard M. McCool, Jr. in the first half of 2024. At Newport News, we redelivered CVN 73 USS George Washington after completing her refueling and complex overhaul and continue to progress on the test program for CVN 79 John F. Kennedy. In the Virginia-class program last year, we were awarded the long lead time material for two additional Block V boats and the first two boats of Block VI. We completed work on SSN 796 New Jersey and expect to deliver in the first half of 2024. And SSN 798 Massachusetts is nearing float-off which we anticipate in the first quarter of 2024. In addition to the 2024 milestones, we've included our 2025 milestone outlook, which reflects our continued focus on execution. Regarding our workforce, I'm pleased with the positive progress in hiring. We hired over 6,900 craft personnel in 2023 and continue to see progress early this year. For 2024, we have a hiring target of approximately 6,000 craft personnel. The competition for skilled labor and shipbuilding and the larger manufacturing sector continues to impact our shipyards and our supply base. With our Navy partner, we will continue to invest in our team to improve worker retention and proficiency, both within our shipyard and in the supply chain to ensure we fulfill our contractual commitments and meet our financial objectives. At Mission Technologies, we delivered another outstanding quarter, performing ahead of plan across all business units, leading to strong revenue growth in 2023. In addition to the record revenue growth, Mission Technologies booked new and recompete contract awards with nearly $6 billion in total contract value. Also, Mission Technologies ended the year with a robust business pipeline of $75 billion, which makes us optimistic about potential growth opportunities in 2024. Key growth drivers include support for mission readiness in artificial intelligence, cyber and electronic warfare, advanced modeling and simulation, LVC and C5 ISR. Turning to activities in Washington, D.C. for a moment. We are pleased with the passage and enactment of the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2024. The FY '24 NDAA strongly supports our shipbuilding programs including multiyear procurement authority for Virginia Class Block 6 submarines and incremental funding authority for LPD 33. The Defense Authorization Act also includes necessary authorities to support the implementation of the AUKUS agreement. Looking ahead over the next five years, we expect revenue growth of more than 4% and cash generation of $3.6 billion. Our expectations are grounded on the assumption that we must deliver on our commitments to our customers. Also, while the trajectory may not be linear due to the timing of ship milestones and material timing, we expect that HII will be generating approximately $15 billion annually in revenue by the end of the decade. As always, fundamental to our expectations for the business is executing on our contracts and developing and providing solutions to our all domain customers. We take this responsibility very seriously and remain focused on executing our program commitments. So with that, I will turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financial results and guidance. Tom?
Thomas Stiehle: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results and also provide our outlook for 2024. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated fourth quarter results on Slide 4. Our Q4 revenues of $3.2 billion increased approximately 13% compared to the same period last year. This growth was driven primarily by higher year-over-year revenue at all three segments, leading to record quarterly revenue for HII. Operating income for the quarter of $312 million increased by $207 million or 197% from the fourth quarter of 2022, and operating margin of 9.8% compared to margin of 3.7% in the prior year period, up 609 basis points. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to higher segment operating income. Net earnings in the quarter were $274 million compared to $123 million in the fourth quarter of last year, up 123%. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $6.90 compared to $3.07 in the fourth quarter of the previous year. Moving to our consolidated results for the full year. Revenues were a record $11.5 billion for the year, a significant increase of 7.3% from 2022. The improvement was driven by strong year-over-year growth at all three segments. Operating income for the year was $781 million and operating margin was 6.8%. This compares to operating income of $565 million and operating margin of 5.3% in 2022. The operating income growth was primarily driven by year-over-year improvement in segment operating income at all three segments. Net earnings for the year were $681 million, compared to $579 million in 2022, up 17.6% and diluted earnings per share was $17.07 compared to $14.44 in 2022, up 18.2%. For segment results on Slide 5, Ingall's revenues of $2.8 billion in 2023 increased $182 million or 7.1% from 2022, driven primarily by higher volumes in surface combatants and amphibious assault ships partially offset by lower NSE program revenues. Ingalls' operating income of $362 million and margin of 13.2% in 2023, both improved from 2022 results driven primarily by a $70.5 million sale of a court judgment to recover unpaid receivables for the prior repair, refurbishment and modernization of foreign built frigates. The higher volumes that I just mentioned and the contract incentive on DDG 129, partially offset by lower risk retirement on LPD 28 and LPD 30 than the prior year. At Newport News, 2023 revenues of $6.1 billion increased by $281 million or 4.8% from 2022, primarily due to higher volumes in aircraft carrier construction and engineering and submarines and partially offset by lower revenues in the RCOH program and naval nuclear support services. Newport News 2023 operating income of $379 million increased $22 million from 2022 and margin of 6.2% was relatively consistent with 2022 performance. The increase was driven by higher volumes I just discussed, and a revenue adjustment on CVN 73, partially offset by contract incentives on the Columbia Class Submarine Program in 2022. Shipbuilding margin for 2023 was 8.3%. Admission technology, 2023 revenues of $2.7 billion increased $312 million or 13.1% from 2022, primarily driven by higher volumes in C5 ISR and cyber, electronic, warfare and space contracts. Mission Technologies 2023 operating income of $101 million and segment operating margin of 3.7%, both improved operating income of $63 million and segment operating margin of 2.6% in 2022, driven primarily by a $49.5 million settlement of representations and warranties insurance claim relating to the acquisition of hydroids. And the higher volumes I described, partially offset by a contract loss and lower equity income due to the sale of a joint venture. Mission Technologies 2023 results included approximately $109 million of amortization of purchased intangible assets compared to approximately $120 million in 2022. Mission Technologies EBITDA margin for 2023 was 8.6%. Turning to cash. 2023 free cash flow was $692 million, handily beating the guidance due to strong year-end collections as well as benefiting from the sale of the Frigate court judgment and settlement of the reps and warranty insurance claims I've highlighted. During the year, the company reduced debt by $480 million, invested $278 million in capital expenditures, paid $200 million in dividends and used $75 million to repurchase shares, while ending 2023 with $430 million in cash on hand and the liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion. Net capital expenditures finished the year at 2.4% of revenues, just under 2022's value of 2.5%. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $44 million in 2023. Our pension outlook for 2024 has improved from the update we provided in November, given the better-than-expected returns to assets, partially offset by a decrease in discount rates since that time. Asset returns for 2023 were 12.3%. Pension expectations for 2025 through 2027 have been updated. And similar to the update we provided for 2024 last quarter, the fast benefit has increased from our last update, given the more immediate recognition of the positive asset returns experienced in 2023. This is partially offset by the impact of the lower discount rate. We've also provided an initial view of our 2028 expectations. Turning to Slide 7 of our financial outlook for 2024. Given backlog growth performance in 2023 and the strong demand for our products and services, we are now forecasting mid- to long-term HII revenue growth of 4-plus percent. For shipbuilding mid- to long-term forecast revenue growth has increased from 3% to approximately 4%, although growth in 2024 will be tempered due to the outperformance in 2023. Accordingly, we are forecasting 2024 shipbuilding revenue between $8.8 billion and $9.1 billion. For 2024, we expect shipbuilding operating margin to be between 7.6% and 7.8% as we continue to target incremental margin improvement. For Mission Technologies, we continue to expect approximately 5% mid- to long-term top line growth. And again, due to the 2023 outperformance driven by approximately $80 million of material timing. We expect tempered growth for FY '24, forecasting revenue between $2.7 billion and $2.75 billion. And we expect Mission Technologies operating margins to be between 3% and 3.5% and EBITDA margins to be between 8% and 8.5%. In 2024, amortization and purchased intangible assets is expected to total approximately $109 million, of which $99 million is attributable to Mission Technologies. We expect first quarter revenues of approximately $2.2 billion for shipbuilding and $650 million for Mission Technologies, with shipbuilding operating margin near 7% and Mission Technologies operating margin near 2.5%. Moving on to capital expenditures. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to see the long-term capital expenditure rate of 1.5% to 2% of general sustainment. In the near term, given the significant demand in submarine construction, we are partnering with our Navy customer to invest in expanding our shipbuilding capacity and throughput. The investment is expected to drive CapEx to approximately 5% on average for the next three years, with 2024 targeted to be approximately 5.3% of sales. I will note that the sustainable free cash flow levels we've previously discussed are not expected to be impacted by this due to customer investment, evidenced by the projected free cash flow growth over the next five years, I'll provide shortly. Additionally, on Slide 7, we have provided our updated outlook for a number of other discrete items to assist with your modeling. Moving on to Slide 8. We have provided an updated view of our free cash flow outlook for 2024 of $600 million to $700 million, ending our prior five year free cash flow projection period with an estimate of $3 billion up from our prior estimate of $2.9 billion. I'm also pleased to provide a free cash flow outlook for the next five years or for FY '24 to '28 of approximately $3.6 billion. I would note that these forecasts do not include Section 174 deferral, which if it occurs, would beat a tailwind to approximately $150 million to $200 million in 2024. On Slide 9, we provided our capital allocation prioritization model unchanged from previous discussions, but updated for current events. We continue to remain committed to an investment-grade rating and have reduced our leverage ratio to under two turns at the end of 2023, a year earlier than planned. In addition, we finished paying off our $650 million term loan in January of 2024, which concludes our debt repayment prioritization while securing our investment-grade ratings and credit metrics. In 2024, we expect to return approximately $500 million of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Lastly, on this slide, the Board has approved a revision to our share repurchase program in both term and amount resulting in available share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion through 2028. To close on my remarks, company's mainstay programs are well supported in demand, and MT's growth success continues to expand and diversify our portfolio. Our future is bright and within our control by executing on our current production contracts and capitalizing on the growth demand for HII products and services. We've exceeded our 2023 financial guidance metrics in terms of revenue, profitability and free cash flow while investing in our programs to facilitate growth and throughput. Additionally, we've strengthened our balance sheet, paying down debt and lowering our leverage ratio. Lastly, fine-tuned the HII investment thesis on the last page of the earnings presentation, focusing on the portfolio strength and visibility execution and growth and free cash flow expansion driving our current and future capital allocation commitments. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Christie for Q&A.
Christie Thomas: Thanks Tom. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Myles Walton from Wolf Research. Myles, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Myles Walton: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe to start with the CapEx change, obviously, pretty material, $300 million annualized step up in run rate. A couple questions on it. One, why isn't it dropping through a higher revenue run rate in the near term, like '24? And second, why is it only a couple three-year investment? What specifically is it going towards? Thanks.
Thomas Stiehle: Hi, good morning, Miles. Tom here, I appreciate the question. Yes, so we mentioned here that traditionally we look at maintaining the yards to be about - 1% to 1.5% with about another point-to-point to have specific projects. As we've talked about in the recent past, we have a lot of activity that's going on in the yards, acquisitions specifically at Newport News, and driving down into the submarine program there. So, we're putting more boats on contract in on VCS in the Columbia program. And as we're working ourselves through those negotiations and schedules, we see - it necessitates additional capacity and throughput. So in conversations with our Navy partner, we've partnered on what that means. There'll be - a couple more buildings, more capacity in the yard, and its requiring investments. Just over three years, we have defined projects that, we've worked through and we've gotten approved through the Board and with the Navy. And the investment there from the Navy will pay for the majority of that. So as much as it rolls through, I'm capitalizing the projects themselves. I'll get the investments on the contracts, to help offset that. So it's a three-year run, it peaks out. The first year at 5.3%. And as I said, we've kind of given you, what the free cash flow projection is from '24 to '28 to kind of evidence that, we're still good to our thesis of the cash flow inflection to $700 million plus as we go forward. There's a shake to it, obviously, of that $3.6 billion I gave you. And obviously, it grows over time as the revenue and the incremental margin expansion comes online. And then as the CapEx falls off on years four and five. But we think it's a good business arrangement. It facilitates the growth that we're talking about. You heard in the comments, both from Chris and myself, we're raising shipbuilding from 3% to 4%. And this capital investment by both the Navy and us facilitates that growth long-term.
Christopher Kastner: Miles, I'd also add that I obviously want to fact '24. These projects take a while to get implemented. But it does support the mid to long-term growth.
Miles Walton: Okay. And Chris, just to follow-up on the longer-term projection and the capital allocation prioritization. You'll probably get into this Investor Day. But the last several years have been a lot of cash going to paydown debt. It doesn't sound like we need to do that. So are we at a point, where we can more commit to a significant majority, or not all of the free cash flow to return to shareholders over the timeframe looking forward?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. I'll start. So, we fundamentally believe the greatest source of value that we can achieve as a corporation, is to focus on our operational priorities right now and delivering our ships. So, you see that in the capital investments. And then we're fairly clear on our capital allocation priorities relative to investing in our investing in our shipyards, being investment grade, progressively improving our dividends, and then providing any remainder back to shareholders. Now that being said, we're going to have optionality around M&A. We have the responsibility, to evaluate M&A projects from time-to-time. I don't see any significant holes in the portfolio right now. And operationally, I think our greatest focus needs to be on delivering our ships to our customer, because they need them. So while we're not going to commit, to providing everything, back to shareholders on this call. We need to, we're forced to have a strong balance sheet and we can do everything. So that's how we're thinking about capital allocation moving forward.
Thomas Stiehle: Yes, if I could piggyback on top of that. And Miles, I think you're looking at it the right way. If you look back on where we've been right in '22, we gave back to the shareholders $249 million in dividends and repos. This year, it's up to $275 million, which is 40% of free cash flow. We have to keep in mind for 2023, it was $480 million of debt paydown. So, we actually between the debt paydown and what we gave back to shareholders. It was better than 100% of the free cash flow of $692 million for 2023. And now for this year, as we're saying $500 million of dividends and repos is still another $229 million. I just paid $145 million in January. There's $84 million of on payment in May. So $229 million of debt and that concludes it, kind of going forward plus the $500 million I'm committing to again is over 100% of free cash flow going back to the shareholders this year. If you take the midpoint of the guide of $650 million, right? So it's ramping. We're giving you the commitment through 2024. We haven't told you, we're committing to pass that, but we would envision as we work off each year and the cash is there, that we'll update you accordingly.
Miles Walton: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is from Gautam Khanna from TD Cowen. Gautam, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Gautam Khanna: Yes, hi, I joined a little late. So I apologize if you covered this, but could you update us on the timing of when the three milestones that's looked at Q4, will get caught up? And if there's any downstream impacts from those delays, but maybe crowding out labor, or anything else? And then if you could just talk about the milestones in 2024, are there any that are kind of late in the year Q4, weighted that could pose a similar note? Thank you.
Christopher Kastner: Sure. Thanks, Gautam. The two VCS milestones, we're essentially complete with both of the operational commitments for those milestones. There were some late breaking changes on both of those boats that, needed to be implemented before we could claim victory, and finally achieve them, but we're essentially complete. The staffing has been significantly reduced, on each of the boats and it's been reallocated, to the other boats. And no material financial issue related to those at all. On LPD 29, we ran into an issue going through the test program that we need to stop and do a root cause corrective action on. We've done that. The ship went to sea this week, performed well, we think we'll deliver that here late Q1, early Q2. Now from '24 milestone impact, we're all aligned within the corporation relative to those milestones. It does put some pressure on the VCS milestones at the end of the year on 798 and 800, but we have detailed plans to achieve those and we're committed to getting those done.
Gautam Khanna: Thank you. And if I could follow-up, I just wanted to make sure I understood the accounting on those three that moved out of Q4. Were there positive team catch-ups related to that in Q4 and if not, do you anticipate that in Q1 and Q2 as you recover?
Christopher Kastner: No, there were no material financial issues related to those. Obviously on LPD 29, there is a bit of an opportunity lost there that, will recover when it ultimately gets delivered, but it's all included in our guidance.
Gautam Khanna: Got you. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
Christopher Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Seth, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Thanks very much. Good morning.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning, Seth.
Seth Seifman: Good morning. I guess in other your earnings calls this quarter, we've heard about various supply chain challenges on Virginia. I guess, can you speak to kind of how you feel your estimates are looking on Virginia and the amount of risk in those estimates? And then to the extent that, is there much in there that's contemplated for inflation reimbursement, because it seems that contractor expectations for inflation reimbursement have been coming down. Has that been the case for HII, or were they not there in the first place? Or is the sub-industrial base different, because it's such a priority?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, so we don't have inflation protection on the VCS program at this time. The supply chain is a challenge across all of our programs, actually. We do have EPA protection of the most part at Ingalls, and we're managing supply chain risk across the portfolio. The Navy is fully aware of this. We're very transparent about it. That's why the SIB funding is so important. That's why getting three-year AP is so important. So, we could just eliminate that risk. But we evaluate our EACs every quarter and if there's risk we deal with it in that quarter. But it's not going away anytime soon. I think everyone understands that. That's why we have SIB funding being appropriated and authorized. And as soon as we can get that down into the supply chain, the better.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Okay. Thanks. And maybe just a quick follow-up on the capital deployment. If I look at the $3.6 billion over the period, think about the dividends and the 2024 debt paydown. That maybe leaves like $2.25 billion. I know the repo authorization, I think the slide says there's about $1.5 billion left. I mean, would you think that there's before, that it's possible to exceed that $1.5 billion by 2028?
Thomas Stiehle: Yes. And what that means is regarding like - we extended to term and time, but we can always go back and change that again. So we wouldn't read too much into the math of it. But as we said, there's $1.5 billion available, $1.5 billion by 2028. And as we move forward, we'll adjust that accordingly. So that was just more of a housekeeping issue that we cleaned up.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Thank you very much.
Thomas Stiehle: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Scott, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Scott Deuschle: Hi, good morning.
Thomas Stiehle: Hi.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning.
Scott Deuschle: Hi Chris, just to clarify, did the LPD 29 delivery delays have much extra cost associated with them? Or is it more just the function of some extra time and a deferral of the AC, rather than a diminishment of the AC opportunity?
Christopher Kastner: Well, there's time and shipbuilding is cost, right? So, we've probably lost a little opportunity there. It's not material in nature. And we'll do that. We'll take a step up if appropriate when we make final delivery. But it obviously would have been worth more if we did it at the end of the year.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. Got it. And then, Tom, just from a reporting perspective, why are Venezuela insurance recoveries included in operating loans rather than below the line? A lot of people are thinking you started reporting this quarter? Thanks.
Thomas Stiehle: Yes, the way that accounting works on that, it's got an angle, it's in the operating income and other income. Because we've had that contract. We incurred cost on it. So it's a recovery from cost that, we've had both in the past and we had written off. So, it comes back still as an operating income. It doesn't go into the revenue. So, there's not a rev-rank to it. But we do account for the margin and income statement. And obviously, we picked up the cash on both of those, on both the frigate and the reps and warranty in Q4
Scott Deuschle: Okay. And then, Tom, last question. Is there any kind of ramp to the - or slope to the free cash flow target, the cumulative target over the next five years? Or is it fairly leveled at '24? Thank you.
Thomas Stiehle: No, there is a ramp to it and the shape to it. I knew when we gave that that people would want to see that, because we've been giving you the shape of the current one from 2020 to '24. But really only the back end of it. When we first announced that, we didn't provide it either. And the only reason why we're not trying to be kind of too nebulous - five years, a lot of moving parts, how it can move around. I can tell you it's not a reach number. We wouldn't put it out there. We don't feel that we can hit it. But I'm most comfortable right now. I try and manage by year. And we gave that number to show with the evidence ramp and the revenue that we talked about for 4% plus to HII across the enterprise, we see that mission technology is definitely accretive and pulling cash for us right now. Your modeling should easily be able to get to that number. But I really want to get through 2024 and then we can give you a guide on what like 2025 kind of, looks like in each year thereafter. Okay.
Scott Deuschle: Thank you. That's resolved.
Thomas Stiehle: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. David, please go ahead. Your line is open.
David Strauss: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning, David.
David Strauss: Chris or Tom, I wanted to ask about the shipbuilding margin target. So, I think, you have been targeting 7% to 8% for '23 and you talked about '24 being above that. And then you had milestones slip out that, I would assume with those potential EAC adjustments that would help. So, I guess what changed in terms of the progression on the shipbuilding margin side as it relates to '24, versus what you talked about, or were thinking about before?
Thomas Stiehle: Yes. So, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, right? Yes. We did talk about 7.7% to 8.0%. There's a couple of milestones that we missed at the end of the year, which causes a little bit of a drag, as you saw how we finished off. Still shipbuilding healthy with the recovery of the sale of the claim, 8.3% still kind of beat the guidance with the claim on a recurring run rate. I'm with you that it's a little bit short on that right now. And we'll pick it up kind of going forward, right? So, I'm not just going to have function up, but we'll pick up where we have on our run rate as we finish our milestones as we get credit for that. There'll be some stuff up so long the way. I think 7.6% to 7.8% is appropriate. I'm a comfortable and conservative on that right now. And I've gotten to the last couple of years and we've missed a couple of attempts right at the end of the quarter. So, I don't want us to get ahead of ourselves a little bit. Let's kind of earn each of these quarters. I think 7.6% to 7.8% is the appropriate way to kind of look at it. If we - that get the hiring and the retention and we have clean shifts through the whole year, and we make up our milestones, we could be on the upper end of that range. It's not higher, but I think for now finishing the year off at 8.3% with the claim, the bottom end of the guide right now without the claim. I think that's the right starting point with a year's worth of shipbuilding to go through 2024.
David Strauss: Okay. And then one last about working capital. I think for the year, at the end of the year, you came in kind of below your target. It looks like you're around 5% of sales. So how does working capital look going forward? I see some of the CapEx recovery will flow through working capital at least over the near term? Thanks.
Thomas Stiehle: Sure. Yes. Yes, we've had a lot of conversation on that working capital. And I know when we were much higher in that at 10% and 8% range that was concerned, like how could we get that down? And we were projecting that that would happen. I'm happy to report that it's kind of landed right where we thought it would be, right? So, I think we started the year off in around 6% to 6.5%. We finished the year off at 5%. The conversations we've had in the recent past, we've talked about it used to be 6% to 8% without Mission Technologies with the additional sales for Mission Technologies. It's more like 4% to 6%. And that's I had highlighted that we were coming down, you know, with COVID in the rearview mirror, production programs that we have, trying to maintain the schedules with the same type work. We would see a normalization of the working capital. And that's exactly what's played out. We've lost about a point of working capital throughout this year. And I still anticipate kind of going forward a little bit improvement in that as we go forward. So 4% to 6% is the right way to kind of look at it. We exit '23 at 5%. And I would expect in 2024 to be on about you know, a little bit lower than that between 4% to 5%. The capital incentives will help as we get the cash up front, before the cost is completely incurred. And I think that's the appropriate way to kind of model it, going forward in the 4% to 5% range in the next couple of years.
David Strauss: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Pete, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Pete Skibitski: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning.
Pete Skibitski: Thank you. Tom, I think you just helped us out a little bit. But can you quantify, and sorry if I missed it, can you quantify the two one-off gains in the fourth quarter at Ingalls and Mission Technologies?
Thomas Stiehle: Yes, our Mission Technologies it was - the warranties and representations for the purchase of Hydroid was a settlement cash $49.5 million. And then Ingalls, we picked up from a frigate repair effort that we had in the late 90s and had cost against that. And we've been working to see how we could get a recovery on that. And we did get a settlement judgment in 2018, and then we were able to broker and sell that entity for $70.5 million. And you'll see in the K2, there's a little bit of a back end on that, too. We'll see how that plays out. But that's about all I want to say about this. It net's about $120 million gross, but obviously I pay tax on that. So net tax is the impact to the profitability and cash was $95 million.
Pete Skibitski: Yes. I appreciate it. And then maybe a more top-level question, what gave you guys the confidence to raise kind of the midterm outlook despite the fact that we don't have a '24 budget appropriated yet. And then on the '24 supplemental that's out there, I think there's a lot of shipbuilding industrial base money in there. Maybe you could talk about that. And is there anything else in the supplemental that could benefit you guys?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So I'll start with that. The '24 budget is very positive for us. All our major programs are supported. LPD 33 is supported, which is really important to Ingalls. The submarine industrial base funding in the baseline budget is important. I think that's around $400 million, but the additional $3 billion in the supplemental, just further effort to improve the supply base. And there's also funds within that to improve the labor force. So getting both of those approved is really important. Now our confidence relative to the guide is just on the demand for our products. We see the demand for nominated products in shipbuilding, both in Newport News and Ingalls, but also Mission Technologies. And when we laid it out, we looked at the investments we're making and the opportunity it just makes sense. We're in a bit of an inflection point from a sales standpoint. And I actually think there's probably some tailwinds if we can get that summary industrial-based funding approved, executed and start improving throughput. Tom, do you have anything to add?
Thomas Stiehle: Sure. Yes. We've talked about the demand for the products and services we have. When you go around the horn down there, Ingalls just won seven destroyers with a pretty good clip on the schedule side of that with options in the future for that. We see the 30-ish ship building plan, the five-year side app. We've talked about the 17 boats that are going to happen, already to long lead for the last two on Block V and then VCS Block VI. Those advanced procurements happen. They have to get definitized. We're talking about Columbia Build II, the RCOH for 75 and then just the preponderance of work that we have, change work and then the growth at Mission Technologies. We updated our annual plan every year, obviously, it's a 10-year look. And when we really kind of look, we say mid to long that's like 5% and five to 10 years. I know the street that's too far, but at least five years, we see growth rates at least that, if not higher. And things have to break our way with timely awards. We have to get labor any of the materials have to hit. But we can just see how the programs are playing out cost, inflation, orders, backlog and things of that nature. And we think it's appropriate to raise to these levels, and there's still opportunities above and below this for additional growth.
Pete Skibitski: Great. Thanks guys.
Thomas Stiehle: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Ron, please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein: Hi, good morning.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning, Ron.
Ronald Epstein: Maybe just a follow-on - two questions, one on the supply chain and one on labor. On the labor front, how is retaining labor been? Because something we've heard across the industry, not specific to you guys, but generally across the industry, it's been tough to retain labor that companies are bringing in young mechanics, or whatever, they stick around for a year or two and then they take off. I mean how are you guys fairing on that front? And what are you doing to keep them?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. Ron, thanks for that question. It's definitely been a challenge over the last couple of years citing the exact example that you brought up. And the team has a number of initiatives they've implemented over the last year to address the situation, and they center around 3 fundamental issues, really, which is flexibility for the team that we're hiring in work schedules potential time off. The craft person, man and women that we are now hiring is not fully prepared to come right into the workforce and start that kind of daily grind without having some flexibility in the work schedules. So, we have a number of pilots that we're working in that regard. We have some really interesting analytics around targeting geographies that we have better success in hiring and retaining. So, we have initiatives there. And then we have very focused incentives on critical skills. An example is machinists where you have to just pay them more to get them and keep them. So a number of initiatives, we pivot very quickly because we have such good data on what works, or what is going to work and what does work. So, we can expand upon it. But you're hitting on a fundamental issue in the industry right now in the manufacturing industry as a whole. And within defense and in shipbuilding is that the labor issue is obviously one of our major risk issues and one we're working very hard to resolve. I would also say the Navy understands it. And in the SIB funding, as I previously mentioned, there are workforce development issues as well. Getting people into the apprentice schools, because our retention rates in the apprentice schools. And established programs are significantly higher because the people that go in there are choosing that as a profession. So it's something we're well aware of. Our partners are well aware of it and the Navy is well aware of it, and we're addressing it. We've seen some rays of light as we ended the year, but you can't really trust a couple of data points. So we're going to keep working on it this year.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then on the supply chain with the investment that the Navy is making, where does that have to be made? And where are the weaknesses in the supply chain today as you see it?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So they've done a really good job, both on the VCS program and on the DDG program, it doesn't get enough as much press, but on the DDG program as well as identifying single source or sole source vendors, in the supply chain that need investment to increase capacity because as you know, capacity had dwindled a bit in the previous 10 to 15 years. So they've done a very good job targeting those suppliers and making investments. And then there's some large critical material where there's a single source suppliers that are dealing with the same sort of labor and supply chain issues that we are. So to identify those potentially dual source them, or qualify an additional source is something that the Navy and we are looking at as well. So it's a very comprehensive review. I think it's managed very well by us and our partners. And I think it's going to get it the issue, but it doesn't turn overnight.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. Got it. Thank you very much.
Christopher Kastner: Thanks Ron.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Noah, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Noah Poponak: Good morning, everyone.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Tom, can you give us the pieces that bridge your actual full year '23 free cash versus what you had last guided it to?
Thomas Stiehle: So, we started the year with $450 million. We guided up to $500 million. You can - at $692 million, at completion, if you take out the two claims net tax, obviously, that's $95 million comes off the $692 million gets you to $597 million. And then the difference between the increased guide in Q3 of $500 million to $597 million, with strong collections in Q4. The team really stayed on it. We make sure that we've got a building on time and we had a clean Q4 receivables. So, it's just across the enterprise. There wasn't anything of significance to really note in that.
Noah Poponak: Okay. So if I take that final and take out the claims, I guess, call that closer to $600 million. Can you bridge me from that to staying there in '24 while CapEx is going up as much as it is? If you're - because you got revenue guidance that's up kind of 2% or 3% in a flat segment operating margin?
Thomas Stiehle: Yes. So I had mentioned in my comments upfront that this active and significant Navy participation in that. So I don't want to get too much into the details, but we're both contributing to it. But that's helping offset that increase there. So the guide of $600 million to $700 million, we took that down a little bit from where I left you last quarter as we exceeded this year, a little bit of timing, too, was in there on the collections. So a little overachievement in 2023, a little back off from where I left you last time at $700 million, now it's $600 million but I would not be alarmed, because of the higher CapEx in '24, '25 over '26. That it's going to be a major draw on the free cash flow from the discussions we've had in the past. That's been a little bit of guiding light. We definitely want to support our customer perform in existing contracts. Much of the work we're talking about for the new CapEx is on the new requirements that are coming. And as we broke with that relationship and how we make that happen, we're going to ensure that we kind of keep everything in lockstep. We got to be ships out to get cleaner and sooner, high-quality value. And on our side, we still have to be able to kind of run the business here and have good working capital. So all that's in the mix. And I would not be concerned on the 5.3% against the cash flow projections that we've given you. Again, that's why we gave you - again you probably won't see that too often a five-year projection going forward. But we wanted to settle everyone out there that, all that's been factored in, as we run the business and we manage our cash.
Noah Poponak: So how will we actually...
Thomas Stiehle: I'm sorry, go ahead. Go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Well, I'm just wondering like if there's a Navy participation will we see - will not all of that actually be recorded in CapEx? Or will it flow to your CapEx and come back in your rates in your operating margin? Or how will we actually see that in your financials?
Thomas Stiehle: So when we do our CapEx, obviously, our costs, we get incentivized to go do that. So it comes on the contract in the form of capital incentives, additional margin and cash that flows through there. That helps offset by additional cost of okay. I would comment just earlier to your question, as you try to kind of normalize the $692 million out to like $597 million as I said, when you pull up the two claims. It's the ramp that we've been talking about. If you go back to '21 it's $449 million and '22 at $494 million And now we've got the claims. Now it's ramped to $597 million and then we're at $600 million to $700 million. We've talked about a $700 million number in 2024 and just a little bit, its range bound now, because we exceeded in 2023. And now the $3.6 billion, the average of that is $720 million, and that's got to shape to it, obviously. It's going to be smaller upfront as the revenue incremental margin grows in the out uses going to be large in the back. I think that's appropriate right now. It's not a stretch number. It's a - it's conservative. It's a reasonable number. We have risk to kind of go work off. And I think that has both risks and opportunities associated with them. So I'd leave you with that.
Noah Poponak: So the piece that goes through CapEx that's supported by the Navy that we'll just see that in future margins as it flows through your rates? Is that right?
Thomas Stiehle: Yes. Margins and cash, yes.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And then I guess, I just -- so for '24, with the margin guidance flattish year-over-year, I still struggle to see where that $300 million is coming from?
Thomas Stiehle: So on the margin side, first, is the timing of when that happens, right? So you get that on contract and you've got to do the work, and there's a percentage of completion you take. So there's a lag on the margin side. And on the cash side, we try to make sure that we try and stay neutral so that we're not impacted as an incurring costs that high of 5.3% of CapEx, but that gets offset on the payment schedule of the CapEx, right? So the margin is not running exactly with the cash. But on our side, we're trying to keep it neutral here. So it's not going to impact our projections that we've given.
Christopher Kastner: Yes. It's part of the total ship P&L, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Okay. Okay. All right. I appreciate that. Thanks so much.
Thomas Stiehle: Sure Noah
Christopher Kastner: Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. George, please go ahead. Your line is open.
George Shapiro: Yes. I wanted to ask your actual ship revenues were like almost $300 million higher than what you -- the high end of the guide that you provided on the November call. So just wondering why, given that, to me, this is a fairly predictable business? And I have a different question, too.
Thomas Stiehle: Yes, sure, sure. So from the MT side, we saw a nice rush at the end of the year of some receivables. I mentioned in my notes, it's about $80 million. So that was a big pickup. On the shipbuilding side, just the timing of material on how that floating here, the majority of the overage and where we felt we would land was on the material side. We have some outsourcing going on as well. So those costs flow through opportunistic that they landed in 2023 here. But we guided $86 million to $88 million, we came about $100 million over that and you kind of normalize that. It was good growth there. You saw it in shipbuilding better than 5%, 5.5% in shipbuilding. Ingall's up in the 7s and Newport News at 4.8%. But it was a sharing between all three divisions that just exceeded. It was a nice run at the end of the year on the revenue side.
Christopher Kastner: George, you're familiar with material timing, you can miss by a month to 2 months from time to time. It just came in at the end of the year. Now unfortunately, it impacts the guide for the next year, right? So you had to -- we had to include that. But it was just timing.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then the other one probably for Tom, if you had a $49 million benefit in Mission Systems from Hydroid I mean, it implies the rest of the business made $2 million. Now you alluded to some charges at some of the other businesses there. But if you could just provide some more information on that?
Thomas Stiehle: Yes, that's right. A piece of that's timing on how the program is just playing out in the mix and execution on that. We did have one job over there that we just took a slight step back. It wasn't material. You won't find it in the K. I guess it's not at the threshold, there's a couple of million dollars on that. But not a lot of dollars when you break down that kind of business to begin with. And then when you take a small charge and then the timing of performance on how we book things, it came out to be a light quarter there. But overall, with the claim, 8.6% EBITDA, the RCOH 3.7%, you can normalize that out. It'll be a little bit on the bottom end of the guide that we gave you, 8 to 8.5 at the beginning of the year the EBITDA. But as we had mentioned throughout the year, there was the joint venture that we sold off, we picked up cash, but we lost some equity. And we've been kind of mentioning about a charge on a manufacturing effort that we have over this I think that's behind us right now kind of going forward. And I'm still very satisfied with the numbers that MC kind of put up across the board for revenue, margin and cash.
George Shapiro: And Tom, if you could just provide the EAC for each of the sectors in the quarter?
Thomas Stiehle: Sure. So for the quarter, that was $111 million of favorability, $43 million of unfavourability, a net of $68 million was made up of about 50% Ingall's. That net was 50% in Ingalls, about 35% of Newport News, about 15% in MT just for everyone on the call, you'll see in the K, which does the whole year, was $309 million growth, gross favorability for the whole year, $191 million gross unfavorable with a net of $118 million. And that breaks out to be about 75% Ingall's and 15% MT and 10% Newport News. I appreciate the question.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Thomas Stiehle: Sure, George.
Operator: We will now be taking our last question from Scott Mikus from Melius Research. Scott, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Scott Mikus: I wanted to ask, is any of the customer-funded investments over the next 3 years? Is any of that contingent on the supplemental package making its way through Congress?
Christopher Kastner: That's a good question, and I don't have that in front of me. That's a really good question. I don't have that in front of me. I know part of it -- I think a part of it is, but I couldn't quantify it for you. So we'll get that information for you, Scott.
Scott Mikus: Okay. Got it. And then thinking about the shipbuilding revenue growth rate, you've for a long time, talked about labor being the governor on output there. So how much can these investments improve throughput in the shipyard if retention rates don't improve materially?
Christopher Kastner: Well, it has to be both, right? And we -- when we do our projections, we risk adjust them. It's not assuming that everything works out perfectly. So it has to be both. We have to improve our retention rates. We have to improve out of the supply chain, and we have to improve capacity. And if we do that, then throughput will significantly increase. But you're absolutely correct. We have to be successful in both.
Thomas Stiehle: Scott, I'd supplement that, too, that as we're building that out, how we hire, how we train, how we've retained we're not standing flat for it, but I know that the yards themselves have active plans on either outsourcing or contract labor, using additional overtime crew that we do have, working the three full shifts where there's a critical path. But there's dials that we have to try and offset that in the near term. You can't run that five or 10 years if you see - we see the demand we're building out organically that we'll be able to do things in the yards. But right now, there are dials and opportunity sets for additional labor outside the yard that we're employing right now.
Scott Mikus: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Thomas Stiehle: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. This is all the time we have for the Q&A session today. So I would now like to hand back over to Mr. Chris Kastner for any closing remarks.
Christopher Kastner: Yes. Thank you, and thank you for joining the call today. I'm very proud of our team's strong performance last year, and I'm confident that we will continue to create value for our shareholders this year. I would also like to remind you that we are hosting an Investor Day on March 20 and look forward to seeing many of you then. Have a good afternoon.
Operator: Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a lovely day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Third Quarter 2023 HII Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker’s presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Christie Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Thomas, you may begin.

Christopher D. Kastner: Thanks, Christie, and good morning, everyone. Today, we released quarterly results that demonstrate continued topline growth across all three of our divisions, steady operational performance and strong free cash flow generation. Our focus on the fundamentals of the business is evidenced through our strong 5.3% year-to-date revenue growth or outstanding 2.4 book-to-bill in the quarter at Mission Technologies and continued shipbuilding milestone achievements. Given our year-to-date results, we are pleased to increase our 2023 revenue and free cash flow guidance, and Tom will provide more information on these increases during his remarks. Our talented workforce remains focused on executing our strategy, supporting our customer's top national defense priorities by delivering quality platforms, technologies, and solutions, and in parallel, winning new business leading to growth opportunities. Before I get into the results, I would like to thank our HII employees’ at all three divisions for their dedication, innovation and customer focus. Let's turn to our results on page three of the presentation. Topline growth increased 7.2% from the third quarter of 2022, resulting in a record third quarter revenue of $2.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share was $3.70 for the quarter, up from $3.44 in the third quarter of 2022. New contract awards during the quarter were $5.4 billion, which resulted in backlog of approximately $49 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $27 billion is currently funded. Shifting to an update on our shipbuilding milestones. In the third quarter at Ingalls, we launched amphibious assault ship LHA 8 Bougainville, and lay the keel for LHA 9 Fallujah. Also, we successfully completed acceptance trials for NSC 10 Calhoun, and delivered her last month. In addition we successfully launched and christened the Flight III Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, DDG 128 Ted Stevens. Finally, LPD 29 Richard M. McCool Jr. is expected to complete acceptance trials and deliver in the fourth quarter of this year. Ingalls contract awards this quarter included a $155 million contract for the modernization of USS Zumwalt DDG 1000, and the significant award of seven of ten Flight III Arleigh Burke-class destroyer in the FY23 DDG multi-year procurement competition. At Newport News, we continue to make progress on the Virginia-class attack submarines as we laid the keel of Oklahoma, SSN 802, and we reached pressure hull complete on Arkansas SSN 800. We expect to Float off SSN 798 Massachusetts and deliver SSN 796 New Jersey before the end of the year. We also continue to make progress on nuclear-powered aircraft carrier construction CVN 79 Kennedy is focused on compartment completion and the test program having turned over more than 70% of the ship compartments to the navy and lighting off combat systems for integrated testing. CVN 80 enterprise is progressing well and is approximately 25% complete. The cost for the combined buy of CVN 80 and 81 has benefited from the bundling and early procurement of the majority of the material. So much so, that over 70% of the material for CVN 81 has already been placed on order generating significant savings over the traditional approach to ordering. However, due to major component delays from the supply chain driven primarily from COVID, and the labor and supply chain effects subsequent to COVID delivery of CVN 80 is forecasted to be approximately 12 months late. To mitigate the delay, HII has worked with the Navy to employ innovative build techniques, which minimize the impact of CVN 81. At Mission Technologies, we saw the third straight quarter of record revenue with sales of $685 million, 15% over the third quarter of 2022. In addition to strong sales growth, Mission Technologies also won several majors strategic competitions in the quarter, and now has posted over $5 billion in potential total contract value bookings year-to-date. These awards resulted in a third quarter backlog book-to-bill of 2.4 and a year-to-date backlog book-to-bill of 1.2. Significant wins in the quarter included the $1.4 billion joint network engineering and emerging operations task order, the $347 million contract for the Navy's Lionfish SUUV program and $244 million task order to integrate Minotaur software products into maritime platform for the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. Shifting to activities in Washington, the federal government began the new fiscal year under a continuing resolution, which funds government operations through November 17. Well, we applaud the Congress for including an anomaly in the CR that will allow DoD to deviate from typical restrictions and obligate funding to begin construction to begin construction of the second Columbia-class nuclear submarine, we look forward to Congress proceeding as expeditiously as possible on appropriations bills. We also look forward to Congress completing their work on the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act with the respected bills of the house and the senate, reflecting strong support for shipbuilding and other national security priorities. Final outcomes will depend on eventual respective conference negotiations between the appropriations and authorization committees. We are encouraged by the support of our programs thus far in the four committees of jurisdiction during the fiscal year 2024 budget cycle. Now turning to labor, we have hired nearly 5,400 craft personnel year-to-date through the third quarter, which puts us 8% ahead of our full-year plan of approximately 5,000. We have work to do to improve our retention rate and the shipbuilding teams are laser focused on addressing this challenge. Retention and attendance and the acceleration of workforce development will remain consistent focus areas for us going forward. In summary, this was a very strong quarter, demonstrating continued focus and progress on our strategy of executing against our backlog and driving growth in Mission Technologies. We remain committed to continuing to create value for all of our stakeholders, our employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, and communities. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom, for some remarks on our financial results. Tom?
Thomas E. Stiehle: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I'll briefly review our third quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please be refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on slide six of the presentation, our third quarter revenues of $2.8 billion increased approximately 7.2% compared to the same period last year, and represents a record third quarter result for HII. This increased revenue was largely attributable to growth at Mission Technologies and Ingalls shipbuilding. Operating income for the quarter of a $172 million increased by $41 million or 31% from the third quarter of 2022, and operating margin of 6.1% compares to operating margin of 5% in the same period last year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher segment operating income, a more favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment and more favorable non-current state income taxes compared to the prior year period. Net earnings in the quarter were a $148 million compared to a $138 million in the third quarter of 2022. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $3.70 compared to $3.44 in the third quarter of the previous year. Moving on to slide seven, Ingalls revenues of $711 million in the quarter increased to $88 million or about 14% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher volumes on amphibious assault ships and surface combatants. Ingalls operating income of $73 million and operating margin of 10.3% in the quarter increased from last year, primarily due to higher volumes I mentioned earlier, and favorable changes in contract estimates compared to the prior year. At Newport News, revenues of $1.45 billion increased $8 million or 1% from the same period last year. Newport News operating income for Q3 was $90 million, a decrease of $12 million compared to the third quarter of last year. Operating income was lower due to contract incentives earned in the Columbia-class program in the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by improved performance on the Virginia-class submarine program. Shipbuilding operating margin in the third quarter was 7.5%, slightly ahead of the outlook we had provided for the quarter. Our shipbuilding operating margin outlook for the full year remains unchanged. And as we have previously noted, our expected shipbuilding milestones for 2023 are concentrated largely in the fourth quarter. At Mission Technologies, revenues of $685 million increased $90 million or about 15% compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher volumes in mission based solutions, driven by our C5ISR and cyber, electronic warfare, and space programs. Mission Technologies operating income of $24 million compares to operating income $14 million in third quarter of last year. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by the higher volumes I just mentioned, as well as improved performance in unmanned systems. Current results for Mission Technologies included approximately $27 million of amortization of purchased intangible assets. Mission Technologies EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 8.2%. Turning to slide eight, Cash from operations was $335 million in the quarter. Net capital expenditures were $42 million or 1.5% of revenues. Free cash flow in the quarter was $293 million. This compares to cash used in operations of $19 million. Net capital expenditures of $77 million or 2.9% of revenues and free cash flow of negative $96 million in the third quarter of 2022. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $11 million in the quarter. During the third quarter, we paid dividends of $1.24 per share or $50 million in aggregate. We also repurchased approximately 100,000 shares during the quarter at an aggregate cost of approximately $21 million. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have repurchased approximately a 176,000 shares as an aggregate cost of approximately $37 million. Moving on to slide nine, I'd like to provide an update on our pension sensitivities for 2024. Our forecast in early 2023 assumed asset returns of 8% and a discount rate of approximately 5.5%. Through the end of the third quarter, discount rates have increased approximately 60 basis points and our year-to-date asset return is roughly 4.6%. Pension related numbers are subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria. We will provide a multiyear update of pension estimates on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. Also I would like to highlight that our pension funded status remains strong and has improved year-to-date. Additionally, I will note that the cash flow impacts related to pension changes remain minimal. Moving on to slide 10. Given the strong third quarter free cash flow, we are increasing our 2023 free cash flow guidance to approximately $500 million, an increase of $75 million from the prior midpoint guidance. This increase is primarily driven by the conclusion of the negotiations regarding the payment of COVID advances as well as positive cash flow contributions for Mission Technologies. We continue to expect approximately $1.2 billion of free cash flow over the two-year period of 2023 and 2024. I'll highlight that we continue to expect to distribute substantially all free cash flow shareholders through 2024 after planned debt repayment, which is currently on track. Turning to slide 11, in addition to increasing our fiscal year ’23 free cash flow guidance we’re increasing our revenue guidance of both shipbuilding and Mission Technologies. Given the strong third quarter revenues across all three divisions, we are increasing the midpoint of shipbuilding revenue guidance by revising a range from $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion to a range of $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion, and increasing our Mission Technologies revenue guidance from approximately $2.5 billion to approximately $2.55 billion. This is an increase to the midpoint of shipbuilding revenue guidance of $50 million an increased to Mission Technologies revenue guidance of $50 million. Additionally, we are reaffirming our shipbuilding Mission Technologies margin guidance. To summarize, we delivered strong revenue growth in the third quarter and finished slightly ahead of our margin expectations for the quarter. We also delivered strong free cash flow. Mission Technologies had an impressive third quarter backlog book-to-bill of 2.4, and year-to-date has the potential total contract value awards of over $5 billion, in addition to a robust opportunity pipeline of $70 billion. Looking to the end of the year, we are pleased to raise 2023 revenue and free cash flow guidance and reaffirm margin guidance as we continue to execute the milestones and commitments that we've laid out. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Christie to manage Q&A.
Christie Thomas: Thanks, Tom. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Christie. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Scott, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Scott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.
Christopher D. Kastner: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Deuschle: Chris, what's the financial impacts from the delay on CVN 80? I think you said it was 12 months. And then was that delay known when you closed the books and accrued the EACs for the quarter?
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes, approximately 12 months. And we've been holding that risk for a while on our financials. So there's no financial impact related to it. That impact is driven by some issues in the supply chain and some major equipment in the bottom of the ship, but no financial impact related to it. And the team's doing their best to mitigate the impact. The good news on that is we do have some EPA protection, which mitigates it a bit. But the team's focused on it and they're going to do their best to mitigate the impact going forward.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. That's great. And then I think one thing that's been maybe a bit confusing to investors is trying to understand the impacts to Huntington or the read through when your partner books negative EACs on Block V Virginia-class boats due to supplier costs. Can you just maybe, like, level set us on how we should interpret that? And I realize your booking rates are probably lower in there. So it doesn't necessarily mean you book, need to book negative EACs, but does it have any impact to your longer term margin trajectory on Block V? Thanks.
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes. So, we evaluate our EACs on all our programs on a quarterly basis and take appropriate adjustments up or down as we see fit. I continue to believe that there's opportunity in Block V. As we transition out of the Block IV boats and get into Block V, we should have some upside. But I wouldn't comment on our partner's accounting, but I'm very comfortable with where we're at.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
Christopher D. Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Scott. Our next question today comes from David Strauss from Barclays. David, your line is open. Please proceed with your question.
Josh Corn: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Josh Corn, on for David.
Christopher D. Kastner: Hi.
Josh Corn: I wanted to ask about the outlook for shipbuilding margins in 2024 if you see any improvement and what some of the drivers might be. Thanks.
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes. So I fully expect incremental improvement in shipbuilding margins as we move forward. It's all about transitioning out of the Block IV boats in Newport News and the Block V and continuing to improve in Newport News. So the story hasn't really changed quarter-to-quarter. Newport News continues to stabilize. Labor is good. Hiring is good. We still need to work on retention. But I'm comfortable with where we're at.
Josh Corn: Okay. Thank you.
Christopher D. Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thanks very much. Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Doug, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.
Christopher D. Kastner: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Harned: On your margins, at Newport News, you talked about you met your goal of 7.4% for the quarter. But when you look at the margin improvement you're going to have to have in Q4, can you walk through what has to happen there because there you're going to have to get a lot of upside in margins in Q4 to meet your guidance, it looks like.
Thomas E. Stiehle: Hey, Doug. Yes, it's Tom here. So, yes, we have been consistent throughout the year here saying that the shipbuilding milestones were in the back half of the year, specifically for Newport News. We have two large milestones here in the 796, delivery and then the 798 float off. So, that's going to be a driver on the back half of the program. And there's a lot of focus down there. Chris, has talked about the hiring and the attrition that we're doing, the extra training, the operating system that we've added down there. Think as COVID becomes further in the rearview mirror against the portfolio of contracts that we have right there. And opportunity sets are bound as we finish off the ships that were impacted to start new ships. Although we saw them up at a lower level, that incremental margin improvement story exists especially at Newport News. But specifically, just on Q4, I think for the last 13 weeks of the year, it's continued performance on the ships that we have here. And kind of hitting the milestones I just described, ensuring that we're getting progress and watching, the heads we have on the programs, and keeping the rework in check.
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes. To support that, Doug, it's absolutely 796 needs to get delivered, that boat is essentially complete, which need to get to trials, 798 needs to float off and then 29 needs to continue to complete their test program and get through their trial efforts. So, it's going to be a race to completion on 29, but we're fine with where we are now.
Doug Harned: And then when you look at the submarines, in Columbia-class, becoming more and more important. I mean, how what is the, can you describe what the mix is right now in your work between Columbia-class versus Virginia-class and how you think of Columbia-class as it grows, affecting margins over time.
Christopher D. Kastner: Well, Columbia-class, as you know, we only build 22% to 23% of that, both the [bells] (ph) and the sterns. It'll grow at an importance at Newport News and provide a good source of growth, but how we perform on the VCS program is going to really dictate how Newport News does in the long run. The Columbia-class is important work. It's high priority work, but it really won't dictate a margin performance going forward in Newport News.
Doug Harned: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Christopher D. Kastner: Thank you, Doug.
Operator: Thank you, Doug. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Ron, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jordan Lyonnais: Hey. Good morning. This is Jordan Lyonnais on for Ron.
Christopher D. Kastner: Good morning.
Jordan Lyonnais: Would you guys be able to give more color. Good morning. Would you guys give more color on the retention rates of where they are now and also to for all the new hires that you have when you expect them to reach optimal efficiency?
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes. So, we don't provide our retention rates. We're meeting or actually beating our hiring forecast for the year. So, feel good with, where we are there. The second -- what was your second question again? I'm sorry.
Jordan Lyonnais: How long for the new hires, for the fully working?
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes. So, we talk about three to five years, the interesting stuff. Some of the interesting things we have going on in Newport News is digital shipbuilding, which we think will increase the time to talent. But we generally think three to five years and we can accelerate that with some of our digital tools.
Jordan Lyonnais: Got it. Okay. And then one other question too. For the office funding, the $3 billion and then also the, other supplemental from the White House was $3 billion. Are you guys seeing that flow through, or do you expect it? Can you size it?
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes, we absolutely expect it eventually to flow through. We – office is very important to us. We actually see that as an opening of markets, right? It's an opening of markets in the U.K. and Australia. We think in the short term here, it's really not material financially, but funds could flow next year in important areas like workforce development, supply chain assessment, infrastructure support. We're following the Navy's lead on this. They absolutely are being very methodical, in how they think through this, but we're, we're standing ready to support them and look forward to. But it's really from top line standpoint, it's more of a medium to long-term opportunity, but we need to make sure that we're taking the steps now to ensure that we're prepared for.
Jordan Lyonnais: Great. Thank you guys so much.
Christopher D. Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. George, your line is open. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Hi. Yes. Good morning.
Christopher D. Kastner: Morning.
George Shapiro: Chris, I guess you increased your free cash flow for this year, but reduced it for next year. So, what was the timing that really caused that to occur? Because, obviously, you left a two year number the same.
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes. It's just timing, George. As you know, from time-to-time, we're you get receipts flowing sooner than you expect. The team's working very hard on working capital. It's a focus for us. I'll let, Tom go into specifics.
Thomas E. Stiehle: Yes. So specifically here on 2023, what we've seen is some good performance on Mission Technologies, both topline and the cash collections. And how they're performing in the MBSS. So, that is positive. Also, just kind of hitting on milestones right now, is adds, to the free cash flow at the end of the year, as well as we've come through the COVID repay with our customer set. We've worked ourselves through strategy and algorithm, how that applies to the contract. And that was a couple of dollars there too. So, that's the confidence in the lift that we went from the midpoint of 425 to 500 for this year. As I've been pretty consistent on our five year target, the guiding light from mid-year this year through the end of next year is $1.2 billion. So, we brought this year up to 75. A piece of that, as I said, is the retentions with the COVID. So, that was just timing anyway between ’23 and ‘24. If you notice between $5 and now $700 next year now from $780, it's still the $1.2 billion. I think there's tailwinds against that as we finish out this year. And opportunity sets kind of going forward, but we didn't want to get ahead of ourselves. So we maintained a $1.2 billion target here. Okay.
George Shapiro: Okay. And just to follow-up, on the margins in the fourth quarter that, Doug, had asked about I mean, specifically, it looks like the fourth quarter's got to be about 9.2% just to get to the low-end of your guide. Now, given the milestones in the fourth quarter, I would assume the biggest jump in the fourth quarter from normal is going to be at Newport News.
Thomas E. Stiehle: I think, the three remaining milestones are all important for us to kind of get into the range. And, we're watching them as Chris, has a pathway on each of the three here. 796 is ready to go. I think we're just waiting for transfer that ship. 798 should float off before the end of the year. And LPD 29, we've been saying since the beginning of the year that it's just a race to, align up the final tasks, the ship to see in serve approving the ship, and then we see that whether that happens in December, the end of December or at the beginning of next year, those three are pretty significant milestones as they play out as we go forward here. I think opportunity sets on there may be a little EPA adjustment as we've seen rates high, and then just the consistent performance seen, we've seen some settling of performance over the last couple of quarters. So, I think that will play out. ‘23 is opposite on ‘22 where we started off really hot and heavy in the first couple of quarters. But, this isn't a surprise for us that Q4 was going to be a big quarter for us. And, I think we're in the lane right now to kind of we're reaffirming our guidance there on profitability for shipbuilding between [indiscernible].
George Shapiro: Okay. Thank you very much.
Christopher D. Kastner: Thanks, George.
Operator: Thank you, George. Our next question today comes from Seth Seifman from JP Morgan. Seth, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much. Good morning. So, I saw that, you guys --
Christopher D. Kastner: Morning.
Seth Seifman: Morning. So, you guys increased the revenue guide for shipbuilding. And I wonder if you could talk maybe a little bit more over time about the opportunity for growth at Ingalls, with the, especially with the latest multi-years on the DDG, how that growth profile kind of looks now maybe versus, several months ago and, to the extent to which that can maybe be helpful for the margin mix.
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes, this is Chris. I'll start and then Tom can complete, if we need to here, but they were the DDG 51 really solidifies Ingalls based for the next few years and creates a very stable business down at Ingalls. And we don't give growth rates by division. But what we're seeing is a bit of an inflection point from a topline standpoint, both in shipbuilding and Mission Technologies, I don't want to get in front of it, we'll wait till the end of the year before we can communicate that. But, well, I think we're in a pretty good place. Growth has shown up in shipbuilding. It's driven by the supply chain and stabilization of labor. And then Mission Technologies is just winning stuff. They're converting their re-competes, they're converting new business, all end markets that we think are very strong. So yes, it's a bit of an inflection point. We're going to talk a lot more about that after we get to the end of the year because we want to close the year strong. But we feel pretty positive about growth going forward.
Thomas E. Stiehle: Yes. I'll hop on the back of that too.
Seth Seifman: Perfect.
Thomas E. Stiehle: Yes, Seth, I’ll hop on the back of that too. I'm pretty happy with what I'm seeing down at Ingalls there. You know, NSC, we delivered NSC 10, so there's one more ship set there. We've talked about how that portfolio can sustain itself and still get 3%, 3% plus potentially if things break their way on just the three major programs down there. We've seen that with the DDGs, the seven DDGs on contract, and now more most recently in August timeframe, they received the seven more there. So, they know what they're building over the next decade. They can line that up from a planning, a labor resource and material perspective, and that's going to kind of really help them drive consistent performance in production down there. Also on top of that, we've seen a maturation of the 1000 program, the DDG 1000 program. So we put, the, first of, there's two on contract, we put the first monetization on contract earlier this year. All three of those ships will be down there over the next two to three years going through an 11 to 12 month modernization process. And that's a good base for them to employ the workforce there too. So I see, good healthiness even with the NSC program sun setting for Ingalls, to hit the 3% guided that we've had through 2023 and going forward. Yes.
Seth Seifman: Excellent. Okay. Thanks very much. I'll stick to one this morning.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Myles, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Participant : Good morning. This is actually Emily on for Myles. Hi, everyone.
Christopher D. Kastner: Hi, Emily.
Unidentified Participant : So on a ship -- Hi there. Another shipbuilding margin question. So, thanks for some additional color on 2024, but I was wondering, are you all able to do any leveling of quarterly cadence for ‘24 at this point? Is there a skew towards either half of the year or quarter-to-quarter? Any color on that would be great.
Thomas E. Stiehle: Yes. So I think it's just a little premature. Obviously, we have some tentative plans right now. We work ourselves through the final planning process for ‘24 and on at the end of this year. We bring that to our internal management and Board here. Once we get that kind of solidified, I'd really like to take a look to see at the actuals at the end of the year, we've talked about those milestones, which we anticipate to hit in Q4, but they just get trickle into Q1. If that does, it would change the shape. So I wouldn't want to get ahead of myself. But, we still maintain the same thesis here of expectation of incremental margin improvement. We think, I mentioned earlier with COVID getting further behind us, us putting the energy into hiring, extra training, retention. The material seems like it's stabilized. It's not where we want it to be, but we have to get that improve, with the maturation of the workforce, anticipation of less rework, the roll over or the portfolio of the existing ships that have increased EACs and scheduled extensions. There's a lot of positiveness kind of going into the follow on years here. And I would anticipate that to grow for shipbuilding. On the Mission Technology side, we've talked about still scaling that business. We've seen some fantastic growth going on the topline. And we have some work to go do and how we get our margins higher there, a little bit more on the fixed price instead of just, at 85% in cost type, additional technology, which should be able to have us deploy IP technology, more products, a little bit more products and services. That should be able to put a premium on what we bid and what we achieve there. So, I would expect, improvement in the margin and at the Q4 call in February we'll give you the shape of next year.
Unidentified Participant : Sounds good, Tom. And then, one quick follow-up. So on the maintenance side, that's something that the Navy been pounding the drums about for a long time. Have you all been getting any more visibility from the Navy customer about timeline for maintenance, we know pretty well about the carrier cycle, but anything on the submarine side, I know those sometimes pop up, and it's a good surprise, but it's hard to plan specifically and then also on the surface side.
Christopher D. Kastner: Yeah. So, Emily, this is Chris. We don't expect real surprise pop ups from a maintenance standpoint. We expect fairly consistent revenue for maintenance at Newport News. At Ingalls, we'll be opportunistic if we see stuff that we could potentially participate in. But right now, it's not in their forecast other than the work we're doing on DDG 1000, which is really not maintenance. It's upgrades.
Unidentified Participant : Great. Thanks, Chris.
Christopher D. Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question today comes from Gautam Khanna from TD Cowen. Gautam, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Gautam Khanna: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Christopher D. Kastner: Good morning, Gautam.
Gautam Khanna: Hey. Quick question. On LPD 29, I just curious your confidence level on that getting, delivered this quarter. Is it a very late in the quarter kind of skew? And just how, if you could give us some framework on what the EAC sensitivity is to that in the fourth quarter?
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes. So Gautam, it'll be a race to the finish on 29. We need to get through the final trials, get in serve in, get it approved and delivered. There's some sensitivity, obviously, as we come through the final, throws on that ship from an EAC standpoint. And then a lot will depend on how much work remains subsequent to delivery. I don't have a specific range for you, but we tend to, as you know, we tend to risk adjust our opportunities as we flow towards the end of the year and LPD 29 is right in the middle of that risk profile.
Gautam Khanna: Gotcha. Okay. So would you argue that the implied shipbuilding range for Q4 bounds that risk? Because it is a pretty wide margin range, obviously, that’s implied shipbuilding.
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes. I don't want to comment on that. There's a lot of variables go into that that range, Gautam. LPD 29 is one of those variables.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And just, wanted to get your sense on given all the labor challenges that you guys have faced on over the last couple of years, what is kind of an appropriate margin increase rate shipbuilding next year. Like, what would be a good scenario or a realistic scenario? I mean, are we talking, like, 10, 20 basis points? Are we talking, a more significant step up, next year in shipbuilding?
Christopher D. Kastner: Yes. So we're not going to give specifics on improvement in 2024. We'll give that on our year-end call. But I do continue to expect improvement. I just think it's a bit premature. Let's get through the end of the year, see how we close-up, close strong, and then we'll give you information on the year-end call.
Gautam Khanna: All right. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate it.
Christopher D. Kastner: Sure. Thanks, Gautam.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. So, I'd now hand the call back to Mr. Kastner for any closing remarks.
Christopher D. Kastner: Sure. Thanks for joining us on the call. Before we wrap up, I'd like to note that we'll be hosting Investor Day on March 20th in New York. So, be on the lookout for more information. Thanks again for your interest in HII and joining us on today's call.
Operator: That concludes today's conference for everybody. Thanks very much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great rest of your day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Second Quarter 2023 HII Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Christie Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Thomas, you may begin.
Christie Thomas: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the HII second quarter 2023 earnings conference call.  Joining me today on the call are Chris Kastner, our President and CEO; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and CFO.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris Kastner. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Christie. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. The HII team delivered another solid quarter. Our results demonstrate continued top line growth and steady operational performance. We continue to make progress on our strategy, executing on our significant shipbuilding backlog and growing mission technologies.  Not only are we executing on our shipbuilding backlog, we are also delivering all domain solutions to our unique capabilities to connect the different platforms that our customers use to perform their missions.  Now let's turn to our results on Page 3 of the presentation. Top line growth was 4.7% from the second quarter of 2022, resulting in second quarter revenue of $2.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share was $3.27 for the quarter, down from $4.44 in the second quarter of 2022. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $2.6 billion, which resulted in backlog of approximately $47 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $24 billion is currently funded.  In the second quarter Ingalls, we laid the keel for LPD 31, Pittsburgh, and successfully completed builder's trials for NSC 10 Calhoun. We also successfully completed acceptance trials and delivered the first Flight III Arleigh Burke destroyer DDG 125, Jack H. Lucas. We expect to launch DDG 128 Ted Stevens, and LHA 8 Bougainville and deliver NSC 10 and LPD 29. Richard M. McCool, Jr., later this year.  At Newport News, we christened Virginia class attack submarine SSN 798 Massachusetts, and redelivered the Nimitz class aircraft carrier CVN 73 USS George Washington. Later this year, Newport News expects to float off SSN 798 and deliver SSN 796 New Jersey. As I previewed last quarter CVN 79 Kennedy received the contract modification intended to optimize its construction schedule and deliver a more capable ship to the fleet earlier, which update the expected ship delivery to 2025.  Slide 4 summarizes the projected shipbuilding milestones for 2023 and 2024, reflecting the updates for the CVN 79 contract modification and an update for the expected shipment of the final module of Virginia class submarine Block IV SSN 801, Utah, which is moved to 2024.  At Mission Technologies, we saw the second straight quarter of record high revenue of $645 million, with sales growing 7.5% over the second quarter of 2022. Mission Technologies had multiple wins in the quarter across its business unit, capped off with the early third quarter win at J-NEEO, a $1.4 billion contract vehicle that serves the national security innovation network, and its mission partners by enabling the transition of innovation in both speed and scale from the lab to the battlespace.  In addition to these accomplishments, we recognized and are committed to the broader international opportunities represented by the OCAS [ph] agreement, which directly align with our capabilities in nuclear submarines, as well as other emerging technologies as set forth in Pillar 2 of the OCAS agreement.  Turning to activities in Washington, the President's budget request for fiscal year 2024 is under consideration by Congress. And as Bill's progresses through both chambers, we continue to see bipartisan support for our programs. We are pleased that the Armed Services Committees have shown strong support for shipbuilding to include authorizing funding for LPD 33 and multi-year procurement authorization for the next block of Virginia class submarines. Both authorization bills which had been passed by the respective chambers, authorized funding for the requested procurement of two Virginia class submarines, one Columbia class ballistic missile submarine and two DDG 51 Early Bird destroyers.  Both House and Senate Appropriations Committees include multi-year procurement authority for Block VI Virginia class submarines, and fund the procurement of two Virginia class submarines, one Columbia class ballistic missile submarine and two DDG 51 Early Bird destroyers. The Senate Appropriations Bill provides advanced procurements funding for LPD 33 in FY24, and a third DDG 51 in FY25. And the House Appropriations Bill includes language supporting a stable rate of procurement of amphibious warfare ships.  Final outcomes will depend on respected conference negotiations between the Appropriations and the Authorization Committees.  Now, moving to labor, through the second quarter, we hired over 3,200 craftsmen and women on a solid pace to meet our full year plan of approximately 5,000. Although we're meeting our hiring targets, attrition remains high and labor is still the greatest risk to meeting our plan. We are continuing to devote substantial effort at both shipyards in the areas of recruiting, robust training and retention of our workforce in this very challenging labor environment.  In summary, the strong demand for our products and services coupled with continued progress on our strategy of executing against our backlog and growing Mission Technologies sets the foundation for HII to continue to fulfil our mission to deliver the world's most powerful ships, and all the main solutions and service of the nation.  And now I'll turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financial results. Tom?
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today I'll briefly review our second quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website.  Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 5 of the presentation, our second quarter revenues of $2.8 billion increased approximately 4.7% compared to the same period last year and represents a record second quarter results for HII. This increased revenue was largely attributable to growth at Newport News Shipbuilding and Mission Technologies. Operating income for the quarter of $156 million decreased by $35 million or 18% from the second quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 5.6% compared to operating margin of 7.2i in the same period last year.  The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower segment operating income, partially offset by more favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustments and more favorable non-current state income taxes compared to the prior year period. Net earnings in the quarter were $130 million compared to $178 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $3.27 compared to $4.44 in the second quarter of the previous year. Shipbuilding results in the quarter were in line with our expectations and slightly stronger than the outlook we provided on a first quarter call. Segment operating income in the second quarter of 2022 benefited significantly from favorable adjustments from facilities, capital and economic price adjustment clauses at both Ingalls and Newport News, making for difficult comparison year-over-year as expected.  Moving on to Slide 6 Ingalls revenues of $664 million in the quarter increased $6 million or about 1% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DTG program partially offset by lower NSC program revenues. Ingalls operating income of $65 million and operating margin of 9.8% in the quarter declined from last year, as expected primarily due to lower favorable changes in contract estimates from facilities capital economic price adjustment clauses, as well as lower risk retirement on LPD 30 Harrisburg.  At Newport News revenues of $1.5 billion increased by $76 million or 5.3% from the same period last year, due to growth in both aircraft carrier and submarine construction revenues. Newport News operating income in the second quarter of 2023 was $95 million, an increase of $1 million or 1.1% compared to the second quarter of last year.  Operating income was largely consistent year-over-year, as favorable VCS program adjustments were offset by lower favorable changes in contract estimates from facilities capital and economic price adjustment clauses. Shipbuilding operating margin in the second quarter was 7.4%, above the 7% outlook we had previously provided for the quarter. Our shipbuilding operating margin outlook for the full year is unchanged. We have noted previously that our expected milestones for 2023 are concentrated in the second half of the year, and largely in the fourth quarter.  At Mission Technologies revenues of $645 million increased $45 million or 7.5% compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by higher volumes and mission-based solutions, which includes our C5ISR, cyber/electronic warfare and live virtual and constructive training capabilities. Mission Technologies operating income of $9 million compared to operating income of $25 million in the second quarter of last year. The second quarter of 2022 included additional non-recurring equity income of approximately $15 million for an equity method investment in a ship repair joint venture, which was sold in the second quarter of 2023.  Cash proceeds of $61 million from the sale are included in investing cash flows. Additionally, negative equity method adjustment of $6 million was recorded from the sale of the ship repair joint venture. Current results for Mission Technologies included approximately $28 million of amortization of purchased tangible assets. Mission Technologies EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 6.7%.  Turning to Slide 7, cash from operations was $82 million in the quarter. Net capital expenditures was $68 million or 2.4% of revenues. Free cash flow in the quarter was $14 million. This compares to cash from operations of $267 million, net capital expenditures of $59 million or 2.2% of revenues and free cash flow of $208 million in the second quarter of 2022. Cash contributions to our pension and other post retirement benefit plans were $11 million in the quarter.  During the second quarter we paid dividends of $1.24 per share or $50 million in aggregate. We also repurchase approximately 37,000 shares during the quarter at an aggregate cost of approximately $7 million. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 76,000 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $16 million.  Moving on to Slide 8, our free cash flow outlook through 2024 remains unchanged, as do our capital allocation priorities. Regarding 2023 free cash flow guidance, we continue to see $400 million to $450 million as the most likely range. We continue to work with our customer on the timing and mechanics regarding the repayment of COVID-related advances, which is currently forecasted to occur in 2023. At this time, we do not have an agreement in place that will increase our free cash flow above the guidance range we have provided.  I'll highlight that we continue to expect to distribute substantially all free cash flow to our shareholders through 2024, after planned debt repayment, which is on track.  Turning to Slide 9, we are reaffirming our 2023 segment guidance. I will also provide some color on how we see the third quarter and the remainder of the year. Regarding the third quarter, we expect shipbuilding revenue to be approximately $2.1 billion and shipbuilding operating margin to be consistent with the second quarters result of 7.4%. This expectation does imply meaningful improvement in the fourth quarter results, which is consistent with when we expect our most impactful shipbuilding milestones to occur.  For Mission Technologies we expect third quarter revenue to be similar to the second quarter results and expect third quarter operating margin of approximately 2.5%. Given second quarter results and the impact of the equity method accounting adjustment I referenced earlier we currently believe that Mission Technologies' 2023 operating and EBITDA margins are likely to be closer to the low end of the guidance ranges we have provided. We expect third quarter free cash flow to be approximately $100 million. Again, there is no change to our guidance for the year. We expect our cash flow generation will fall predominantly in the fourth quarter.  Our cash expectation is consistent with both our expected timing for milestones and our normal cash cadence of the calendar year. To summarize, the second quarter shipbuilding results were largely in line with the expectations we provided on our first quarter call. Newport News and Ingalls continued to hit critical shipbuilding milestones. Mission Technologies delivered impressive year-over-year revenue growth. The Mission Technologies team continues to capture meaningful contract wins and maintains a very robust pipeline. We have great confidence in their future and the long term value creation opportunity.  Finally, we are pleased to reaffirm our full year segment guidance as we remain focused on executing the milestones and commitments that we've laid out. With that I'll turn the call back over to Christie to manage the Q&A.
Christie Thomas : Thanks, Tom. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today is from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Doug, your line is live.
Doug Harned : Thank you. Good morning. 
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Harned : Thanks. On Virginia class, it looks the program right now is it's well behind the two per year delivery objective in Block V. I mean, do you see a path to get there? What are the obstacles here that need to be overcome to get to that rate?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, the largest obstacle, the largest risk on the VCS program right now is labor and meeting our labor targets. We've worked hard here in Newport News to hire. You saw in my prepared remarks we're ahead plan of over 3,200 heads for the year. So that's some positive indicators. But it's -- this is a labor driven issue. And as I said, we've made good progress. We just need to continue to do that over the next couple of years.
Doug Harned : And when you look at Newport News, you're a partner with Electric Boat on Virginia class, but you're a subcontractor on Columbia class. I mean, how do those different relationships affect the way in which you work with Electric Boat on the programs?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, so it's not a material difference. Obviously, you have contractual differences. But when you get down to the deck plate, those teams work very closely together. There's a relationship that's been developed over a number of years between the two teams. And when you think about the efficiency of getting the work done and potentially transferring some work back and forth, there's obviously contractual mechanisms that need to be put in place under Columbia that you don't need under the Virginia class, but they work very closely together.
Doug Harned : So there's no, in your mind there's no real effective difference in the way -- there's no sort of preferred relationship here that one works better than the other?
Chris Kastner: Not really, the objective there is to get these critical assets to the fleet as soon as we can. So the team works very closely to ensure we're working on that.
Doug Harned : Okay, great, thank you. 
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn of Melius Research. Robert, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Rob Spingarn : Hey, good morning, Tom. Just a clarification on…
Tom Stiehle : Good morning.
Rob Spingarn : Thank you. And Chris then a high level one for you. But Tom, on the margins, at Mission Technologies, you talked about the 1.4%, but a $6 million impact from the sale of the JV. So was that impact built into the guidance?
Tom Stiehle : No, it wasn't built into it. It wasn't until right now. So…
Rob Spingarn : All right, so this is why you're tracking to the low end. Is that how I should interpret that? 
Tom Stiehle : Right, yeah. 
Rob Spingarn : Okay, then Chris, a high level question, but between shipbuilding and MT, I thought it might be interesting to hear you talk about how these two businesses can contribute to two priority areas for DoD, and that's CAC C2 and Contested Logistics?
Chris Kastner: That's a really good question. You kind of teed me up there, interesting, the line acquisition, they have really great AI/ML products and big data products that fit right into CAC C2 and potential CAC C2 missions. And when you think about data and big data and the speed in which data can be understood, it fits right into the contested logistics model as well. We're a LVC enterprise that is not just training. It can fit right into a war gaming concept. Think about war gaming, you think about Op plans. You think about op plans, you have to think about contested logistics.  So we have products that that can quickly be adapted to deal with those two issues. We've had high level conversations with the Navy, and other customers about potential applications there. So we think we can add to those products set. We think they're important product sets. And we'll continue to talk to the customer about it.
Rob Spingarn : Thanks so much. 
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Pete Skibitski of Alembic Global. Pete, your line is now open.
Pete Skibitski : Hey, good morning, guys. 
Chris Kastner: Good morning. 
Pete Skibitski : Chris, on the hiring, can you give us the actual net hiring, your net retention numbers kind of after attrition? And maybe can you gauge a level of revenue that could be at risk if you don't meet your net goals for the balance of the year?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, so we don't provide the right net. There's a lot of things going into that equation. We have over time, we have attendance, we have attrition, we have Job Shop labor that can contribute to that. I will say there's potentially some upside if we're able to continue to meet our hiring growth goals and deal with attrition over the balance of the year. But we just need to see how the year develops.
Pete Skibitski : Got it, okay. And then I want to ask about the Kennedy contract mod, it was a little under $4 million on the mod. Does it raise your -- now that that's in place, does it raise your confidence level in terms of how your performance on that project could trend through next year and, and the potential milestone opportunities for you on the project?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, I know the team did a really good job incorporating the PSA work into the baseline contract and assessing the schedule and. And we're putting the work or integrating that work into the baseline schedule. We're confident the way that Kennedy is developing, they're meeting their compartment completion goals. They're -- their test rates proceeding and the plants proceeding. So we got a lot of confidence in where the Kennedy is at right now.
Pete Skibitski : Okay, maybe another way of saying it, are the milestone opportunities on the Kennedy meaningful relative to other programs, or should we not, focus so much on the Kennedy?
Chris Kastner: We're just going to have to see. We're going to have to let things play out over the next 18 months, 18 to 24 months. It's a lot of critical work in front of us. But potentially, if we continue to perform well, there'll be milestone opportunities for sure.
Pete Skibitski : Okay, okay. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure. 
Operator: The next question today is from the line of Seth Seifman of JP Morgan. Seth, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much. Good morning. 
Chris Kastner: Good morning. 
Pete Skibitski : I wanted to ask in Mission Tech, looking at the margin there, and then looking at the contract mix is -- fixed price is a relatively small portion of the mix. I think it's like 12%. And so when you think over time about the profitability that you want to see in that business, and it seems to be an environment where there are more opportunities in the Fed IT services market right now. Is that something that the business is going to try to move higher? Or is that not really consistent with the risk profile that you want to take on?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, so we believe it will move higher. We're going to -- you indicated that the majority of those contracts are cost plus. That's true, I think over 80%, which drives the margin rate a bit lower. The team at our Mission Technologies is -- we're focused on technology there. So there's going to be a lot of cost plus work, but they're competing very well also and in their pipeline, there is fixed price opportunities, and we're going to pursue those where those make sense. And if we're successful, the mix should improve a bit and margin will improve. Tom, do you have anything on that?
Tom Stiehle : Yeah. So you are right, Seth, CD 7% is cost of [ph] contracts. I would say that there is a move afoot. I mean, we kind of realized the customer sets that we have in the portfolio, there is a move to try it. And as we introduce more technology, that will bring about potential premium on pricing on that front. And then as we get away from services and more into products, that's not an area too where we could see an expansion of the margin on those jobs.
Pete Skibitski : Great, thanks. And then just a real quick follow up, Tom, the Q3 cash flow target that you gave, what does that contemplate with regard to the advance repayment.
Tom Stiehle : So right now, a little color on that right. So we got an extension on that. It was supposed to be repaid by the end of June. It was a two month extension. So in negotiations, the Navy's now going out and understanding how we'll transition the contract back from the advanced prog pay that was in place since 2020. I don't have a negotiated settlement on that yet. So I don't know what that's going to entail.  The guide assumes that there's not a payback right now on that. And we'll have to work ourselves through that as we go through here. So that's a normal run rate that we expect for the quarter. It doesn't impact the guide of 400 to 450 that I've said for the entire year. And I would tell you that the best way to model it and take a look at it is stick to that guidance right now. I think another 60 days, we're going to look see and what that negotiations entails, the timing of it, and the impact, although then we have some significant milestones in the back half of the year.  So I have three deliveries, two launches, and one float off. Every time I have a delivery, we liquidate the contract. I get the contract price, the Navy gets the ship. There's some retentions for work that was incomplete there. So there's opportunities that's there to work those retentions off. And that's an opportunity for both margin and cash. And then as I work myself to the back half of the year with LTE 29 is not going to hit this year or next year.  We're still holding that milestone as a 2023 event. But I would take a look at cash just from now through 2024, the milestone chart that we gave you, the five year look. It's 1.2 billion over the next 17 months. And I'm still comfortable that we're on target to kind of make to make those goals. 
Pete Skibitski : Great. Cool, thank you very much.
Operator: The next question today is from the line of Myles Walton of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open
Myles Walton : Thanks. Was hoping you could comment on two items. One, the 801 module move. And I guess does that put any pressure on the margin guidance range for this year? And then also on LHA-8, were there any costs that you had to absorb in the quarter or was it minor and sort of non material?
Chris Kastner: Yes, I'll handle that and Tom can chip in if he needs to. So 801 had some late breaking rework that pushed up module to the beginning next year. It was late in the year delivery. So just modest, really not a material impact that, as I said to Doug previously, teams pretty good at moving work back and forth to ensure they do that as efficiently as possible. So not a material impact on 801.  On LHA-8 I think, first things first, I don't want to just kind of gloss over a pretty significant thing that we like. We really pay attention to in the shipyards is the fire on LHA-8, first thing you have to do is make sure everybody's safe. The team did a really good job. The first responders made sure no one was hurt. Just minor smoke inhalation. But the shipbuilders, and the Navy personnel were safe.  Second thing is to limit the damage. They did that, really minor damage to one compartment, some waterways [ph]. We put a corrective action plan, did a root cause analysis. We're working through that corrective action plan now. So the important thing is that we learned from this issue. So no real cost, or cost to schedule impact that's material on LHA-8, and the milestones for that that ship remain intact.
Myles Walton : Okay, thanks for that. And then just on the buying out of Honeywell's portion of the Savannah River JV, what's the expected outflow for your incremental portion being acquired?
Chris Kastner: Yes, so it's already in, right.
Tom Stiehle : So we paid that. Right now it's in the -- you can see that in the cash flow investing is $24 million on the out and we expect to get additional margin and cash in the out years. We haven't defined that. 
Myles Walton : Thank you. 
Chris Kastner: Thanks Myles.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
David Strauss : Great, thank you. Good morning. 
Chris Kastner: Good morning. 
David Strauss : Tom, can you just give us an update kind of working capital progress year-to-date, it's tracking? I think you're about 8% of revenues now net working capital if you're tracking where you would expect it year-to-date, remind us again of what you're expecting at the end of the year. And what you're baking into the '24 free cash flow forecast.
Tom Stiehle : Yeah, so I am on plan. And consistent with the forecast and discussions we've had past earnings releases 8% about right of where I find myself right now, popping out of this quarter. I work myself through the back half of the year with the shipyards to get around the 6% target that we've talked about. And then there is some tailwinds as we go from '23 to '24, consistent with what we've had, in past discussions.  We used to think of for Mission Technologies the 6% to 8%, was the norm of where we think working capital would be in the yard as Mission Technologies has grown. And we've gotten to more of a cadence between the two yards and our shipyard production programs.  I look at it more as 4% to 6%. And we'll finish this year out on the higher end of that range. And then as we work ourselves into 2024, we'll be on the low end of that range here. Just the cadence making milestones or schedule deliveries, we settled down both in material and the labor that we give me some status about. And that's going to bring about some consistency and keep us in the norm range, as I see in the coming years going forward.
David Strauss : Okay, great. And then follow-up in terms of the shipbuilding margin, that's implied for Q4, are you or are we potentially looking at a margin at Ingalls in a similar range to kind of what we saw in the first half of 2022, when it was strongly in the double digit range? And if LPD-29, that delivery does slip, how much risk is there to the Q4 margin guide? Thanks.
Tom Stiehle : Sure. So we don't give specific forecasts by each yard. But obviously, we can do the math here. It's 6%, 7%, [ph] at the first quarter and 7% for this quarter for Q2 for shipbuilding. And we're guiding 7% for Q3. It's in the low to upper ranges for Q4 and the 9% for shipbuilding across both yards. I'm very comfortable with that. I think I gave an answer earlier, but I'll hit it again. Yeah, we still have three deliveries, two launches, one float off all in Q3 and Q4, heavily loaded in Q4 timeframe.  Both of the deliveries themselves that are upcoming, and the two that we've had this year, have retentions and releases associated with that, that bring both margin and cash. And then on the back half we have some smaller incentives and some change adjudication to that will play out. So I think '23 is opposite of '22. We saw a very strong first half, specifically, as you mentioned Ingalls is in the 13% to 16%, Q1 and Q2. I won't get into the breakdown in the yards as a forecast for the back half of 2023. But I'm comfortable that back half is going to be meaningfully higher than the front half, with the pacing here for the first half of this year.
David Strauss : And the risk around if LPD 29 slips, the delivery.
Tom Stiehle : So it's at the very back half of the year here. As we come through we've talked in the past, whether the deliveries are clean, or the timely or do they go around what we want with a lot of retentions or not. Right now LP 29 is progressing well. We don't see any avenue that is our way right now. We'll have five months of things to do, taking the ship to see and burning down risk there. But we'll have to see how that plays out. I don't want to overly play my hand on that.  It's one ship and one milestone in the context of the shipbuilding here. So I don't think it will either overly hurt or overly help us. And I think I think the guide's appropriate right now. We still maintain the 7% to 8% shipbuilding margin by yearend. 
David Strauss : Thank you.
Tom Stiehle : Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna of TD Cowen. Gautam, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Gautam Khanna : Hey, good morning, guys.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Gautam.
Gautam Khanna : Hey, I was wondering, remember when the fit up came out, and there were different schedules for various ships, in terms of delivery dates and the like. And I'm just curious, relative to the prior update, I was curious if you had any better color on how to reconcile that with your own expectations for delivery dates over the next couple of years. 
Chris Kastner: Yeah, I can start then then then Tom can chime in. I think it's context and timing on those delivery dates, and really assessment of risk. They might move a couple of months or have a different representation of deliveries a couple months, one way or the other. But we assess our, our EACs and our schedules on a very consistent basis. You're looking at a one time adjustment potentially or notification to Congress. So I really think it's a context issue more than a more than a disconnect. Because we work very closely with our customers so that they understand where we are from a schedule standpoint, how we're assessing the schedule. They have their own point of view on the schedules, and it's very reconcilable.
Tom Stiehle : I don't really have much more to add on that. On an annual basis as the NDAA and the budgets pop out, and then obviously we take a -- look at the [indiscernible], which gives you a five year look at the forecast on funding perspective, we reconcile where we stand. It's a cross reference of what we do anyway, every 13 weeks doing EACs and we make sure that we align actuals to date and estimates to complete where we are with our labor and material performance and burn and expectations of future performance. And all that gets baked into revised EAC that marries home, to an updated long range strategic plan that we have, a labor resource plan and then the master construction schedules that we have at each site.  So we're locked tight with ourselves. And then we have monthly reviews with our program offices into our customer. So I don't think there was any disconnect there.
Gautam Khanna : Okay, and just if you wouldn't mind providing the EACs the net EACs by segment and also there was some language in the release about VCS favorable variance. Could you just give us a quick update on how that that program is performing? And if there was a favorable EAC on that program in particular? Thanks.
Chris Kastner: So the net -- I'll start with the VCS performance then Tom will talk about the net EACs in the quarter. So yeah, VCS is definitely showing some stability and some positive momentum. So as Tom said, we assess our EACs every quarter and there's nothing material to note, but there is some -- the team's working very hard, the program team, on VCS, to meet their milestones and meet their cost targets, in really kind of a difficult macroeconomic environment. So there is some progress there.  There's definitely some progress on stability on VCS. I continue to think the best thing we can do on the VCs program is meet our commitments on the block for contract, get those ships and modules out and then transition into Block V where we have more where we have more opportunity. So with that Tom the EACs. 
Tom Stiehle : Yeah, and the favorable, the gross favourable was $72 million, unfavorable was $52 million. That net was $20 million. And that was that was made up of $17 million Ingalls or 85% and $3.9 million or 15% in NMT. There was no specific favorable or unfavorable. That was material. Thanks.
Gautam Khanna : Great. 
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. George, please go ahead. Your line is open. 
George Shapiro : Yes, Tom. If you just look at the free cash flow implied in the fourth quarter, the midpoint's around $360 million. Of the milestones that you have listed for Ingalls in Newport for the fourth quarter, what are the key ones that would contribute to that? 
Tom Stiehle : So I think it's a host of it. You can run down if you go to the slide on the milestones, the launches and the deliveries that we've talked about, the retention releases on delivered ships. We've talked about adjudication to change. There's some minor incentives that we pick up too. So usually because of the seasonality, you do see Q4 to be very strong for us. We saw that last year with over $0.5 billion in Q4. So I think the plan and the milestones are situated for us to generate that same type of result this year.  I would want to clarify, it's early. I think I want to make sure everyone understands what I said the guide specific -- the guide specific for Q3 assumes that there is a repayment for COVID right now. My comment was since I don't know of any change with the Navy, and what that could do, we are sticking to how we guided at the beginning of the year 4 to 450 with the COVID repay is going to occur this year. If and when that changes and we know how much we will give you some more color. I would expect that come the November call for Q3 we'll have a real good look at the milestone performance, how the rest of the year is wrapping up and we anticipate when the negotiations with the Navy is behind us, and give you more color on that. 
George Shapiro : Okay, thanks very much. 
Chris Kastner: Thanks, George.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Ron, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein: Hey, good morning, guys. Just a couple of quick ones. 
Chris Kastner: Good morning. 
Ronald Epstein: Could you speak a little bit about the DDG-51 award that was pretty gigantic? How that's going to play out? Was it a competitive bid? I'm guessing it was right? And now you're thinking about that? But let's start with that.
Chris Kastner: Yeah, so DDG-51, excellent job by the Ingalls team competing for that. It was competitive. There's a standard competitive environment between the two shipyards, both of which are very, very capable shipyards. Getting awarded six is very positive, just shows the demonstrated proficiency of that Ingalls team on executing. Obvious we've delivered DDG-125 already. And we're proceeding on the next three destroyers. So really, really a positive indicator.  What it does is provide a lot of stability for Ingalls moving forward. That should fix ship by combined with LPDs and support for LPD 33 and potential bundle arrangements for LPDs and LHA moving forward provides a lot of stability for Ingalls. And it's very positive.
Ronald Epstein: Got it? Got it. And then on the Savannah River stuff, my understanding of how the accounting would work, that you guys would potentially take a gain, right. I think that's how it works. Are you deferring it? Or did you take a gain in the quarter?
Tom Stiehle : No, we didn't take a gain in the quarter right now. So we become a higher owner of the joint venture, still a minority owner, but a higher owner of it. So as proceeds are released, it's consolidated. How that's recorded as gains happen in the future, they'll be higher than what we've had in the past. So I expect that to play out over the next couple of years.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. So it wasn't like an event where you could mark to market and your carrying value would be greater or whatever. 
Tom Stiehle : No. 
Ronald Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then can you just speak a little bit to how it's going in terms of retention of employees and how the workforce has evolved here as we recover from kind of all the COVID disruptions?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, workforce is definitely evolving. Ron, thanks for that question. As I said previously, hiring is better, right. The applicant rate is better, but retention is still a challenge. And what we're finding is the days of hiring someone, training them and sending them down to the deck plate are really over. We need to ensure that the new hires that don't come through our established programs, because the apprentice school, community colleges, the high school programs are still very successful, when it comes to retention. But the walk-ins, we need to make sure that we shepherd them through the process of the next, 12 to 18 months of their employment, to make them understand that this is a good career, and there's opportunity for growth and stability.  So that's really the fundamental change is the walk in applicants are just not the same as they used to be. So that's what both Ingalls and Newport, Newport News are working on.
Ronald Epstein: Got it? All right. Thank you very much.
Chris Kastner: Sure. 
Operator: And the next question is from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Noah, your line is open.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everyone. 
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Noah. If I take the MT revenue guide to be flat sequentially in the third quarter, I think we'd have to be, maybe down a little or flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter to be at the 5% for the year, after being kind of six to eight through the first nine months of the year. So how much of that is just kind of leaving some conservatism there? How do you see the MT organic revenue growth profile from here?
Tom Stiehle : So, at 645, that's a record quarter that they've had followed, 624, which was the previous record quarter. Feel comfortable with right now. I think 645 is a balance between -- there's new awards that happened -- occur and then get delivery orders funded and awarded for that, get heads in here. I do think there could be some upside here. So we'll see how that plays out. We look at a Mission Technologies, they grew 4%. Last year each of the six business units grew. We see quarter-over-quarter, it's 7.5% sequentially, grew over 5% right now.  So I think north of 5% is the right way to kind of take a look at that. We'll see how that plays out. They on a good string right now of awards. And they're working hard to kind of fill the seats, funded seats that they have. So it's going to be a function of awards and labor as we go forward. But I'm feeling good about the pipeline I have there. Although the book to bill is low right now. I think that's going to come on in the back half of the year. We'll see that pop up on. There's still a plethora of awards for Q3 and Q4 that we're keeping a close eye on here right now.  I think that business is starting to really play out and justify the acquisition of alliances, as we see a sales ramp that's happening.
Chris Kastner: Yeah, so Noah, I could I could add that, not to jump into the early wins in Q3, but on a total contract value, not just awarded, we're almost $4 billion of awards for this year, which is really a record for [indiscernible] and Mission Technologies together. It's kind of unprecedented. That team is really doing very well and will create a lot of stability into the future and potential growth, for Mission Technologies.
Noah Poponak: Okay, appreciate that. And Tom, the 7.7% to 8% for the full year shipbuilding margin, it's a relatively tight range. But if I keep it flat sequentially in the third quarter, to get to the low end of the full year, the fourth quarter would need to be close to 9% and to get to the high end, it would need to be close to 10.5%. Can you speak to where in that range, do you see I know the milestones need to occur and every milestone is different. But where in that range, do you more likely see the 4Q shipbuilding margin falling?
Tom Stiehle : Yeah, I think we're splitting hairs right now. I mean, you can see that there are a lot of milestones out there. Things and then there's incentives and adjudication to change to that occur, LPD 29 a piece of it, although we said early it's not a big swinger, but it does contribute to the margin and the end results. I wouldn't want to get too precise. I mean, 7.7% 8.0% is pretty precise right there. But I do expect it when you run the math we said 6.7% 7.4% through Q2, another 7.4% about for Q3.  We will be in the 9%s for Q4 is the math of it. And I feel comfortable with what's on our plate, the performance I see today. The avenue, I speak daily and weekly with the CFOs out in the yard. So I know what's in front of them and what has to get done both from a performance end of it and then what has to get done on the contract side. And we're very much in place to finish up in that range. 
Noah Poponak: Got it? And then just one other item, back to that attrition question, Chris, has the rate of attrition slowed through the year? I know that's another kind of specific question, but it seems like a pretty important element into your total labor equation.
Chris Kastner: So it's definitely lower than it was coming up COVID. It's been pretty consistent this year. I don't I haven't seen a lot of slowing in attrition this year. It's still the walk in early career people that really aren't prepared for the rigors of shipbuilding. It's a challenging job. And we're just working very hard to get them prepared to understand the real benefits of being a ship builder.
Noah Poponak: Okay, thanks, guys. Appreciate it. 
Chris Kastner: Sure. See you Noah. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski of Alembic Global. Pete, your line is now open. 
Pete Skibitski : Yeah, Chris, although we've talked about this, but the Navy, I think is working up the strategy for the Nimitz retirement. Then there's an RFI out there. Can you talk about -- if you think HII will have a roll on that? Maybe the timing and sizing of that. Just your thoughts on that overall?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, so we will absolutely have a role in it. There's a lot of planning going on within the Navy and Newport News on integration of RCA, OHS, and retirements. We obviously did the enterprise, uniquely qualified to do it. And so it's really kind of an advance planning, actually, because it's kind of a dance between the RCA OHS and then finishing the ships and doing the DND.  So absolutely. It doesn't change my perspective about the long term growth rate of the business. It's integrated into the forecasting. And Newport News will probably do that work.
Pete Skibitski : Okay, but maybe it's like a mid decade to slightly after mid-decade before it starts?
Chris Kastner: I hate to give you a specific time, but it's integrated over the next, 10 to 15 years, to 20 years, actually.
Pete Skibitski : I see. Okay, thank you.
Chris Kastner: It's all in the mix. It's all in the mix, Pete, when you think about their plan, and how we forecast the long term growth rate of the business. 
Pete Skibitski : Got it. 
Operator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. So I'd now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Kastner for any closing remarks.
Chris Kastner: Yeah. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in HII and look forward to continuing to engage with you all going forward.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your line.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 11:25:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the First Quarter 2023 HII Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the call over to Christie Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mrs. Thomas, you may begin.
Christie Thomas : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the HII First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today on the call are Chris Kastner, our President and CEO; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, any forward-looking statements made today that are not historical facts are considered our company's estimates or expectations and are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For additional information regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results, refer to our SEC filings. Also, in their remarks today, Chris and Tom will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. For reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations website at ir.hii.com. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris Kastner. Chris?
Chris Kastner : Thanks, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. First quarter results reflect a good start to the year as we stay on course executing our nearly $50 billion of backlog and growing our Mission Technologies business in markets that support our customers. And I want to thank our 43,000 employees for continuing to deliver excellent products and services in support of national security. Our priority continues to be a focus on the fundamentals in shipbuilding, driving our shipbuilding schedules and delivering critically needed assets to the fleet. With that, we believe our milestones for 2023 and 2024 remain on track and consistent with our prior expectations. As we discussed last quarter, 2023 milestones include 3 ship launches and 5 ship deliveries, and the cadence of these is expected to pick up through the year, specifically in the third and fourth quarters. I will note that we are working closely with the Navy on a change to optimize the CVN 79 schedule, which pulls baseline work from the post-shakedown availability into the construction period in order to provide more capability at ship delivery. Ultimately, this change would allow for a more capable Kennedy to join the Navy's operational fleet. And once this contract change is finalized, we will adjust the crew move aboard and ship delivery dates accordingly. Now let's turn to our results on Page 3 of the presentation. Top line growth was 3.8% from the first quarter of 2022, resulting in record first quarter revenue of $2.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share was $3.23 for the quarter, down from $3.50 in the first quarter of 2022. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $2.6 billion, which results in backlog of approximately $47 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $26 billion is currently funded. In the first quarter at Ingalls, we were awarded a $1.3 billion detail, design and construction contract for amphibious transport dock LPD 32, continuing the serial production of this critical product line for the U.S. Navy and Marines. At Newport News, we were recently awarded the Columbia bill 2 advanced procurement contract for $567 million, allowing Newport News to purchase major components and commodity material and to begin advanced construction on the next 5 submarines in the Columbia-class. Finally, at Mission Technologies, we saw strong revenue and margin this quarter with revenue growing 5.8% over the first quarter of 2022. Notably, this quarter, we were awarded the press program, a base plus 6 1-year options, $1.3 billion task order to provide personnel recovery, enterprise services and solutions for the U.S.-Africa Command. Shifting to activities in Washington. The President submitted his fiscal year 2024 budget request in March, which is now under consideration by Congress. The proposed budget reflects continued investment in our shipbuilding programs, funding the second Columbia-class submarine, 2 Virginia-class attack submarines and 2 Flight III Arlebird-class destroyers. The budget request continues funding [forward-class] nuclear aircraft carriers, an aircraft carrier refueling and overhaul programs as well as investment in the submarine industrial base. On the ship maintenance side, the budget request includes $600 million for the engineering overhaul of USS Boise. Funding is included for the final increment of LHA 9, but funding was not included for the LPD program or a third DDG 51 destroyer, although Congress provided advanced procurement for these programs last fiscal year. We will continue to work with Congress and our customers to support their requirements as we move through the budget process. Beyond shipbuilding, the fiscal year 2024 request reflects continued investments in capability enablers, such as AI, cyber and electronic warfare, C5ISR and autonomous systems, which align well with the advanced technology capabilities of our Mission Technologies division. Turning to labor. We successfully hired over 1,500 craftsmen and women in the first quarter, which is at 30% of our full year plan of approximately 5,000. This solid pace for hiring reflects continued recovery and stability in rebuilding our labor workforce post COVID. While hiring is on a positive trajectory, we continue to remain focused on hiring, the training of our workforce and our workforce development and retention programs. For example, in March, we celebrated the graduation of 200 apprentices from our Newport News shipbuilding apprentice school, strengthening our skilled workforce and leadership pipeline. Moving to an update on the health of our supply chain, where we are seeing stabilized lead times. We have not seen a return to pre-COVID levels. It is important that we not only manage the risk this creates for our current programs but also reflect these increased lead times in our future contracting activity. In summary, we've had a solid start to 2023 with record first quarter sales and continued long-term visibility given our significant backlog as well as future award opportunities based on the strong defense budget. Seeing progress in labor and supply chain lead time stabilization is certainly positive, but we need to continue to manage these risks moving forward. We are maintaining our emphasis on fundamentals, driving productivity to ensure we meet our customer commitments. And now I will turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financial results. Tom?
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I'll briefly review our first quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 5 of the presentation. Our first quarter revenues of $2.7 billion increased approximately 4% compared to the same period last year and represents a record first quarter result for HII. This increased revenue was attributable to growth at Newport News Shipbuilding and Mission Technologies. Operating income for the quarter of $141 million increased by $3 million or 2% from the first quarter of 2022, and operating margin of 5.3% was essentially flat from the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a more favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment and more favorable noncurrent state income taxes compared to the prior year period, largely offset by lower segment operating income. Net earnings in the quarter were $129 million compared to $140 million in the first quarter of 2022. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $3.23 compared to $3.50 in the first quarter of the previous year. Moving on to Slide 6. Ingalls revenues of $577 million in the quarter decreased $54 million or 8.6% from the same period last year driven primarily by lower revenues on the LPD, LHA and NSC programs, partially offset by higher DDG program revenues. Ingalls operating income of $55 million and operating margin of 9.5% in the quarter declined from last year primarily due to lower-risk retirement on the LPD and LHA programs. It is important to remember that the first quarter of 2022 included a very clean delivery of Fort Lauderdale, LPD 28, which provided significant risk retirement at that time. At Newport News, revenues of $1.5 billion increased by $116 million or 8.3% from the same period last year due to growth in both aircraft carrier and submarine revenues, partially offset by lower support services revenues. Newport News operating income in the first quarter of 2023 was $84 million, an increase of $3 million or 3.7% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Segment operating margin of 5.6% was down slightly from last year primarily due to unfavorable risk retirement on enterprise CVN 80. Shipbuilding operating margin in the first quarter was 6.7%, slightly below the 7% outlook we previously provided for the quarter. Our outlook for the full year is unchanged. As we have noted previously, our expected milestones for 2023 are concentrated in the second half of the year, which will drive our performance for 2023. At Mission Technologies, revenues of $624 million increased $34 million or 5.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by higher volumes in mission-based solutions, which includes our C5ISR, cyber and electronic warfare and live, virtual and constructive training businesses as well as growth in fleet sustainment. Mission Technologies operating income of $17 million compares to an operating income of $9 million in the first quarter of last year. Current results include approximately $27 million of amortization of purchased intangibles compared to $30 million in the first quarter of last year. Mission Technologies EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 8% compared to 7.3% for the same period last year. During the first quarter, Mission Technologies did record a provision for a contract loss relating to a manufacturing issue that was not material to our financial results as a whole. Turning to Slide 7. Cash used by operations was $9 million in the quarter, and net expenditures were $40 million or 1.5% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of negative $49 million. This compares positively to cash used by operations of $83 million, net capital expenditures of $43 million or 1.7% of revenues and free cash flow of negative $126 million in the first quarter of 2022. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $10 million in the quarter. During the first quarter, we paid dividends of $1.24 per share or $49 million. We also repurchased approximately 39,000 shares during the quarter at an aggregate cost of approximately $9 million. Moving on to Slide 8. Our free cash flow outlook through 2024 remains unchanged as do our capital allocation priorities. I'll highlight that we will continue to expect to distribute substantially all free cash flow to shareholders through 2024 after planned debt repayment, which is on track. Turning to Slide 9. We are reaffirming our 2023 guidance and providing some color on how we see the second quarter shaping up. Before discussing our second quarter outlook, I want to make clear that we are reaffirming our guidance for the full year with the knowledge that once the PSA modification is completed, the remaining CVN 79 milestones will be updated, including moving the delivery to 2025. We believe we'll be able to reach an agreement that is neutral from a margin and cash perspective to both 2023 and 2024, and our outlook reflects this. Regarding the second quarter, we expect shipbuilding revenue to be largely consistent with first quarter results and shipbuilding operating margin to be approximately 7%. That does imply meaningful improvement in the second half of the year, which is consistent with when we expect our shipbuilding milestones to occur. For Mission Technologies, we expect second quarter revenue of approximately $600 million and operating margin of 2.5%. We expect the second quarter free cash flow to be approximately negative $150 million. Again, there is no change to our expectation for the year. Our cash generation will fall predominantly in the third and fourth quarters, consistent with both our forecasted milestones and our normal cash cadence over the calendar year. To summarize, the first quarter results were largely in line with the expectations we provided on our fourth quarter call. We are pleased to reaffirm our full year guidance, and we remain focused on execution and hitting the milestones and commitments that we've laid out. With that, I will turn the call back over to Chris for some final remarks before we take your questions.
Chris Kastner : Thanks, Tom. Before wrapping up, I would like to point out that we have recently published our 2023 sustainability update report, which among other things describes the governance and management framework that we have established around sustainability. And finally, I would like to emphasize that we remain focused on successfully executing on our strong backlog and positioning for long-term growth, which will generate value for our employees, customers and shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Christie for Q&A.
Christie Thomas : Thanks, Chris. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Doug Harned : I'm interested, when you look at Newport News right now, and you appear to be getting some good growth there. Can you give us a sense of the breakdown of where growth is coming from? And I would say across Columbia-class, Virginia-class, the CVN programs. What really getting at here is, as Columbia-class starts to ramp, can we expect growth there to move above that kind of 3% to 3.5% trajectory that you've been on?
Chris Kastner: Well, let me start and then -- Doug, and then Tom can step in here. I continue to think, and I've said previously, that Newport News will provide the majority of the growth in shipbuilding. So is there potential as Columbia comes online and the aircraft carriers become a more significant part of our revenue mix and then we get Block V in full rate and then into Block VI, that growth could be greater than 3%? Sure. But on a long-term basis, we think the right way to think about shipbuilding is 3%.
Tom Stiehle: Sure, Doug. And I'll hop in. It's Tom here. So yes, we did have some good growth in Q1 there. It was up [$160] million. It was driven by carrier construction, [80 79 81], Columbia-class and the VCS program, partially offset by some fleet support that is just slightly underneath. But as Chris says, I think we feel comfortable about that. We have the capacity and the capability to kind of run that. I think long term, though, it's still kind of governed by labor and program plans that we have in the yard here. So I think 3% is the right way to take a look at it on a long-term basis.
Doug Harned : And then you did the unfavorable -- there was an unfavorable adjustment in CVN 80. Can you -- that sort of surprised me because I would think of less risk on CVN 80 than it was on 79. Can you talk about where you -- what happened there and then also how Virginia-class is still proceeding right now?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So I'll take the CVN 80 first. Just backing up a little bit on color on margin and profitability that we thought we'd be at 7% for the quarter on shipbuilding. We came at 6.7%, and the majority of just that truck full there was about the enterprise step-back that we took. Now we find ourselves, as I noted in my remarks, the front on CVN 80 that we find ourselves from a time capacity and throughput needing to offload and/or outsource unit work and panel work right now. So as we're working ourselves to that, it's early in that project as we ramp that up. And we wanted to make sure that we increase the outsourcing risk protection, and we booked that conservatively. There's still many years to go on that ship, and it's just embarking on some additional out work on that. I would tell you that since the keeling last summer, that ship is coming tremendously along. It's in the dry dock right now. It's growing a lot of steel at it. The shape of the ship is directing, and I'm really proud of what the team is doing with that. But again, we just thought it would be prudent to take a balanced approach as we embark on getting some additional workout cost.
Chris Kastner: Yes. Doug, I'll comment on VCS. Yes, the VCS program, the program schedules for VCS are pretty stable and have been stable for the last couple of quarters. We'll deliver 796 this year. 798 will be delivered the year after that. And actually, we have a christening with Sheryl Sandberg being the sponsor on Saturday for Massachusetts. So you're all invited. It will be streamed live. And Massachusetts is performing well. And then 800 will deliver the year out of that -- after that, excuse me. And then Block V will follow. So I think …  [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. We have lost connection with the speaker line. Please remain on hold as we reconnect them.  Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience. We have the speakers back on the line. Please proceed.
Chris Kastner: Hello, Doug, were you still on?
Doug Harned : Yes, I’m still on. Yes.
Chris Kastner: I don’t know when we fell off. I don’t know if you were at the absolute relative to VCS Program. 
Doug Harned : You were walking through transitions who full unblocked by in milestones schedule. So that’s where you were at that. I think you broke off in the middle of that.
Chris Kastner: Yes. I apologies again. On Block V I do think there is opportunity on Block V, the [indiscernible] order to achieve that, and we're just not at the phase of the program where you'd be retiring that risk. So I still think there's opportunity in Block V. And I apologize for the line cutting out.
Doug Harned : No. No problem.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Melius Research.
Rob Spingarn : Sticking with Newport News, if resources need to be diverted from Virginia to Columbia to keep that on track and given the priority there, are there any conversations with the customer to mitigate any potential economic losses to you or the industrial base -- the submarine industrial base given that Virginia is fixed cost?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So there could potentially be discussions in that regard. I would say, from our point of view, our staffing is pretty solid on the Columbia-class and the Virginia-class right now. So I don't anticipate that. I think you saw that we had a good start to the year from a labor standpoint. Attrition is trending well. attendance is trending well, a lot of training expense as well. But we don't anticipate that right now. We're pretty comfortable from a staffing point of view.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JP Morgan.
Seth Seifman : Wanted to ask a little bit about the -- so I guess we can look on the milestone side and see that there's a lot of -- a lot to come here in 2023 and that, that kind of underwrites, I guess, the margin expansion that you're looking for in the second half. And then, I guess, with the margins coming in, I think, a little bit lower than people expected in the first half, higher than expected in the second half, and it seems fairly variable based on milestones. And then we look at 2024, and we see that each one of the yards has fewer milestones in '24 than '23, although we don't know the value of those milestones could be different. I guess, how do we think about a margin trajectory given how the first half of this year, the second half of this year is so different? How do we think about where that takes us going into '24?
Tom Stiehle: Sure. I appreciate the question there. Yes. So we did say in Q4 that the milestones were on the back half of the year, which we foreshadowed 7% for Q1. And now you can see the outlook for Q2 is going to be that way, too. So it does -- you do the math against the 7%, 7% to 8% and the back half of the year is going to be in the upper 8s on that, and we feel comfortable with that. You are right that the milestones are on the back half of the year there. I would tell you also that what's in the mix there, there's other things on top of the milestones, although they are the major reason that we have the changes in EACs and affect profitability. There's other areas, too, in there, whether it's our performance or capital incentives, either on contract or that we anticipate. We either have those factors or they're in potential. There's risks and opportunities, so we can materialize more opportunities and risk that we realize. So that plays out every quarter that we do at EACs. We also do -- we have our contracts, especially RCOHs, that pop in here and both for the condition and the statement of work that could be fluid over the 2.5 to 3 years that those ships are here. This change, there's condition, it's cost to contracts. So there's change proposals that are in flux right there. We've talked a little bit about on several calls of unadjudicated change. And what you'll see -- what we see here is that the cost is already into the EACs. We conservatively book the recovery on those things. And as that plays out, there's a natural recovery of those true-ups to the contract performance. So there's elements of that that's happening behind the scenes as well as just the milestones. So that gives you some context for 2023. For 2024, there are still more milestones than usual. We have 3 deliveries and 3 launches. We're holding everything on the page that we gave you a quarter ago with the caveat on CVN 79. But there'll be a natural lift as we work ourselves through. We've talked about in the past Block IV and Block V volumes. So that will sit closer to the deliveries of the large ships that we have here. And then as we proceed forward with new contracts that will roll in both the performance and inflationary impacts that we've seen, and that will give us new targets. And then lastly, I'd add that as quarters and years go by here, obviously, the inflection point will hit from the production and learning. As we get this workforce up to speed, the more experienced, successive bills on follow-on shifts, there's a natural lift in profitability on that front as well.
Seth Seifman : Great. That's really helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, just a quick confirmation. I want to make sure I understand. The optimization you're talking about on CVN 79, when reaching an agreement there with Navy and that's finalized, that is a neutral event as far as margin and estimates for the program and cash is concerned for you guys?
Tom Stiehle: I just want to caveat that a little bit. We anticipated to be neutral. It's a benefit both of us and the customer to have that ship be more capable, have more functionality in it, and it will be to the latest configuration. And as we work ourselves through the negotiations on that contract, takes one more statement to work. We'll get scheduled, we'll adjust the targets, we'll situate that. Although we won't get the liquidation and the retention release next year, we'll have more statement of work and cost and cash that's running through the books. And it's our -- we anticipate that, that will be margin- and cash-neutral for the next few years through the delivery of that ship.
Chris Kastner: I could also add, I think it's a really smart thing being done by the Navy here relative to integrating the PSA into the base contract because it reduces deployment risk for the shift. So we're participating in that. We'll get it definitized over the summer. We think it's real -- a very positive development.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.
Myles Walton : Chris, could you comment on LPD 29? I think there's both the sea trials and the delivery aspect that you're thinking about for '23. And obviously, you have trials where you have delivery. And I'm curious, what's the hold time on the trials that you would need to see to actually be able to accomplish the delivery for this year? And how material is that to this back-end-loaded margin for the year?
Chris Kastner: It's definitely in the mix. It's a Q4 trials and delivery. A lot of volume work to go on that ship. They're making really good progress, let off the engines really last week when we were down there. So I'm optimistic that team will start to continue to hit cadence the LPD program that we're very proud of and confident that LPD 29 will get done this year, contingent upon, of course, that labor stays stable and we continue to make progress. But a lot of confidence in that Ingalls team.
Myles Walton : Okay. And just one on labor. Chris, you sound actually really good on labor from a hiring perspective. Could you comment on attrition as well? And is it showing up in the right disciplines and where the pinch...
Chris Kastner: It is. Yes, Myles, it is. So attrition has been positive as well. And it is showing up in the right disciplines. You always having shipbuilding moments in time where you may need welders or rigors or electricians. You might be out of balance a bit. But that's kind of the art of managing labor and shipbuilding. So it's a positive start to the year. It's taken a lot of effort, a lot of effort, and we need to stay on it. Team is very focused on it, but it is positive thus far.
Myles Walton : Great. And sorry, one last one, I can squeeze in. Tom, you mentioned that Mission Technology has absorbed a customer charge, I think. Can you size that? And is that the same that was disclosed in the Q last quarter for the K?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. Appreciate the question there, Myles. Yes, it is the same issue that we had last time. You'll note when you get the Q that the disclosure has improved from a top range to now we've taken a charge. And no, I wouldn't disclose the customer or the charge itself. It's not material to our financials. So you won't see them in the come correct, all right? So yes.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss : Chris, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there was no amphib funding in fiscal '24. If you could just kind of update us on the status there. I mean we seem like there are always these ongoing reviews, and then Congress adds money back. Just kind of where things stand there?
Chris Kastner: Yes. '24 is pretty positive from a budgetary standpoint for us. The one issue, as you mentioned, is LPD 33. We'll work with the customer and the Congress to ensure that they understand the importance of that ship to Ingalls, and we'll just follow it through the process. Got high confidence based on the law of 31 amphibs that we have a chance to get that back in the budget, but we'll just have to follow it through the process.
David Strauss : Okay. And Block IV versus Block V, can you give us an idea of how much of Virginia-class revenue at this point is Block fo versus Block V and how that transitions over the next year in terms of -- I mean, Tom, your point is some potential margin lift as we progress there, Some sort of baseline where we are today and what that looks like?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So as we crossed over at the end of last year, Block V actually has more revenue than Block IV in it, although you find the programs for one better than 80% accomplished with 794 delivered, 796 to go, 798 floating off and then the successive years of the sell-off of 798, 800. So Block IV is significantly more complete with cost in the books here. Block V is still less than 30% complete right now. So there's a mix there. I have more volume on V and I still have a large amount of that program in front of me. As we talked about, I think, keeping the pedal to the metal on the labor, training that workforce, getting serial production cadence happening, which we see that with the operating system at the -- incorporated down there. I think all that's going to add to a real potential of additional profitability in Block V or IV. You don't see it yet, obviously, because it's early in the program. So good that we're getting the sales volume from the VCS program, a lot of interest in that. And we'll just keep working to get the production efficiency going on the VCS program.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.
Chris Kastner: Gautam, are you out there? We may have lost Gautam. Operator, do you still hear us?
Operator: Yes, I still hear you. I don't have Gautam.
Chris Kastner: Maybe he'll come back in. If you could maybe just go to Pete.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.
Pete Skibitski : Chris, I think a lot of us were targeting the return of shipbuilding margins to that 9% range by 2025 or so. Is that going to be still reasonable for that target after this -- the Kennedy contract changes and where you see labor going right now? Or is that a stretch at this point? What are you thinking there?
Chris Kastner: Yes. I don't want to give commentary on '25 margins at this point. We're comfortable with our guidance for this year. I'm comfortable that the way we have the ships delivering and the stability of the milestones that we look for improvement next year. The teams are working on the fundamentals every day within both shipbuilding organizations coming through COVID and the labor challenges, but there are still significant labor challenges we're working through. So I don't want to predict when we'll recover to 9%. I still believe it is a 9%, 9%-plus business. We just need to continue to focus on the fundamentals and execute.
Tom Stiehle: And if I could comment there too, Chris. We're obviously not happy with where we are right now. We're driving hard. We're being realistic with it. The strategy that we have that we've shared with The Street and shareholders is we anticipate and expect expansion of margin. We'll continue to fight through that, and we do that every day and every week here. We get realistic with the ranges that we give that definitely is attainable. We have strategies and plans, and the profiles and the forecast show that we can meet our forecast that we tell The Street. So we'll just keep you updated like we have every quarter, but the trajectory needs to go up, and we're working really hard every day to make that happen.
Pete Skibitski : Okay. Appreciate it. And last one for me, guys, I remember a while back, one of the next big contractual things you were looking to accomplish was getting the fifth [4-class] carrier under contract. And I think you wanted to do that in the midterm, nothing near term. But is that now in the budget? And there was talk maybe even doing another 2-carrier bundle. Are those things still in play in terms of where the budget shook out?
Chris Kastner: Well, it is in the budget. And we do still think and we know that buying them together absolutely saves the Navy money and the right way to buy it. We have -- that hasn't been -- hasn't shown up in the budget as of yet, but we believe that, that is the right way to acquire aircraft carriers. So positive in the budget, and then we'll continue to work with the Navy on potentially working on a 2-ship buy, but that hasn't manifested as of yet.
Tom Stiehle: A comment on the strategy front there, we're looking -- we think it's mix financial and program sense to buy 2 carriers at a time with 3 years of AP on 4-year centers, right? And that's what we're focused on. From a time frame, that would be -- we would be looking for a construction turn on in 2028 and then optimistically, AP in 2025, if not 2026. But that's the playbook we used last time. It's buying power for our customer, it's efficiency for the yard here. We get to buy 2 sets of -- when we materially in the buying efficiency from that. So that's what we're working closely with our customer on.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro : I wanted to ask, General Dynamics on their call commented that they were having supply chain issues in Virginia. I think it was more Block V than IV, and they took a charge for that. And I guess you're not experiencing that. There's different suppliers. Or if you could just explain maybe.
Chris Kastner: Yes. Well, I can't comment on GD's phone call. That would not be appropriate. I'm comfortable with where we are in the VCS program this quarter, both Block IV and Block V. As I've said, we're progressing down the delivery path on our Block IV boats. And then we need to transition to the Block V. But it would just be inappropriate for me to comment on GD's call, but we're comfortable with where we're at.
George Shapiro : So you're not seeing the same supply -- you're not seeing supply chain issues? Is that it?
Chris Kastner: Well, I think we're seeing supply chain issues across the board really. It has definitely stabilized from a lead time standpoint, but it's stabilized at a higher level than pre-COVID. And we need to make sure we take that into consideration not only on our current EACs but on our future bids. So yes, there are supply chain issues, but they they've stabilized a bit over the last couple of quarters from a lead time standpoint.
Tom Stiehle: Right. And I'd add the cost and projected future costs have been incorporated into our EACs. We've updated the milestone schedule here, George. You've seen that we have walked those over the last couple of years when COVID started, and there has been some charges at Newport News that you know about. So as Chris said, I'll reiterate that every 13 weeks, we take a look at the axles today. The ETC expected the forecasts, the material indices, how costs going to come in. And we are comfortable with how we're booked and -- both in the milestone chart that we give you from a scheduling perspective and obviously, what's put into the financial reports or from an EAC perspective.
George Shapiro : Okay. And then, Tom, the net EACs can get for the quarter and the break between the sectors?
Tom Stiehle: Yes, sir. So the gross favorable was 64 up. The gross unfavorable was 55 down. The net favorable obviously, was $9 million, you know what the math of that is. And that's made up of actually -- you'll see now in the Q, there's a revised disclosure that has that information. Ingalls is 14 up of the 9. MT is 4 up that now it's 18 up, and then the Newport News is cumulatively down $9 million. And really, that $9 million is the preponderance of a 7% shipbuilding versus 6, 7, and we had that discussion early on the outsourcing of CVN 80.
George Shapiro : Okay. And then one last one if I can get in here. Can you mention what drives the more negative free cash flow in the second quarter? And then what drives the almost doubling of your free cash flow in '24 after 3 years of relatively similar numbers?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So for the free cash flow, there's a rhythm in a cycle that we have. We usually cash users at the beginning of the year. We saw that in Q1. We had guided a minus $200 million to $300 million. We actually came in at minus 49. So we just had some better timing and collections in Q1. That's just probably pull ahead from Q1 to Q2. We're guiding a minus 150 for the back for Q2 now, the combined Q1 actual and the Q2 forecast. So we're still right on plan on where we thought we would be. And I think when I look where The Street perspective, if we add up both in the Q1 and Q2 expectation, we're slightly ahead of that, which is good. For the free cash flow kind of going forward here, you can look at it like 1 of 2 ways. We've talked about the top line revenue expansion. We haven't had a question on it here, but you heard in the remarks, almost 4%, 3.8% growth. Mission Technologies grew 5.8% this quarter and 3 -- in Q1. Year-over-year, it grew 3.5% from last quarter. And like Q4, every one of anti-Green Mission Technologies business unit expanded their top line. So that's a good sign right there. I really like what we're seeing. But I think that bolsters well. We had talked about long-term shipbuilding growth at 3%. It was 3.1% this quarter. We talked about long-term growth in Mission Technologies to be 5%, and it was 5.8%. The weighted mix should be 3.5%. But as we said, we came in at 3.8% this quarter. So the cases there and the numbers are playing out. From a Mission Technologies perspective, I would just leave you with they're in the year, they finished -- they're coming up on year 2 now this August. The restructures behind them, the leadership's chosen, the business units understanding. They've integrated operations, systems, processes. And I really think the team now has full-time focus and support on their objective of go win a lot of work and execute the contract. So I feel really good about that top line growth. Margin expansion, I know we've talked about it. There's an expectation that 8% to 10% that Mission Technologies would move that up. We had guided that, and that thesis is still in place to get from the low 8s to the higher end of the range of 8% to 10%. And we saw the EBITDA margins in pretty good shape, 8.2% last year. When we normalize out the booking for a joint venture sale that we have there, it was 8.6%. And this quarter, it's 8%. It's early in the year. So I think both the expansion of the top line and the bottom line is real, is in front of us. Managing our CapEx, we've guided to 3% here. So we've come off a high of almost 5% and upper 4s over the last 4 or 5 years, and that adds to the bottom line. We get through the adjustments for COVID, both the FICA and the COVID payments back. I think there's a natural lift that you'll see. Macro perspective, you can just take a look at that from a shipyard perspective, we were generating in the 4.75 to 5.50 just between the 2 yards. And then when you throw another $2.5 billion business with Mission Technologies that's growing annually, 8% to 9% EBITDA to take the midpoint at 9%, the math easily generates through taxes in the vicinity of about $200 million for Mission Technologies. So 500 to 700. So I'm comfortable that we'll get there. We've talked about the step up from '23 to '24 specifically will happen as we get into the cadence of production across both yards. And what we'll find is that working capital will come down a little bit. That will be the initial lift to get '23 up to '24. But then with the growth and the expansion of margin, we see us being $700 million plus -- $700 million to $700 million plus going forward in the out-years.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.
Gautam Khanna : Can you hear me guys?
Chris Kastner: We can. Thanks, Gautam.
Gautam Khanna : Terrific. I wanted to ask what your best guess as to why in the fit-up. A number of the delivery dates on Ingalls ships have moved to the right. And just relative to the last time they published those delivery dates, and they gave reasons for it. But do you broadly agree with those revised delivery dates expressed in the fit-up?
Chris Kastner: Yes. I think what you're seeing there, Gautam, is kind of 2 different processes with potentially different risk expressions. And obviously, we look at our delivery dates and our -- so they don't specifically align, right? We can project better deliveries based on what we're seeing in the quarter of the year, the -- or some of the indicators that could impact delivery. So I just think there are different processes with different objectives. So you're going to have differences from time to time, but we're comfortable with where we're at.
Tom Stiehle: Yes. I'll just -- I'll come behind that, too. That comes out every year, and we take a look at it and we might analyze it. I will tell you at times, you'll see ships and boats move. And at other times, they don't move. And sometimes they stick on a contract date for years, and then they move aggressively. I can tell you, from our perspective, we have -- we're aligned programmatically and -- with our customers on the status of the programs. We're aligned from both the milestones and schedules that we run our yards to, our master construction schedules that go into the milestones that we see to The Street. And then from an EAC perspective, to make sure we have the duration of the programs understood and priced in EACs. So I would not be overly concerned. At times, it's just risks and opportunities, when is the ship available, when is the crew available, when is the test sequencing to get the ships and boats out of here. So a lot goes into that. I wouldn't dismiss them. They're important, but our information is updated and evaluated every 13 weeks here. And I can tell you that the schedules and EACs are aligned to the current performance of both yards.
Gautam Khanna : That's a great answer. And just to follow up on an earlier question about the differences on the Virginia class at GD relative to HII. And I know you're not going to opine on GD. But I was just curious if you could talk about -- since Q2 of '20, when you guys announced the large charge related to COVID and the schedule impacts on Virginia-class, have you had much in the way of negative come catch-ups on that program? Or was that kind of a big -- the big reset, if you will, on the program accounting? I'm just curious, like it doesn't seem called out quarter after quarter. 
Chris Kastner: Yes. So obviously, that was a significant adjustment we made with Block IV. But we, from time to time, have adjustments and we've had adjustments on the Block IV program between then and now. They just haven't been material enough to mention. We're very -- as you know, we have a disciplined process around our EACs. And if we have to make adjustments, we do. So you've kind of got it right on there. We had a significant adjustment. We've made smaller, less material adjustments between now and then, and we're very comfortable with where we are right now.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak : I guess, at this point, should we expect the shipbuilding margin to be up or down in 2024?
Chris Kastner: Well, I absolutely think not giving guidance for '24 yet, but I expect it to improve. I expect both shipyards to execute, barring any unforeseen labor issues or supply chain issues or macroeconomic issues, all things being equal, I expect it to be up. But we're not giving formal guidance on 2024 yet.
Tom Stiehle: I'll reiterate that, too. We've told you where we want to take it to. We haven't told you when because of the environment that we operate under 3 variants of the COVID virus, inflation, unforeseen inflation from a couple of years ago and then the tightness of the labor market going back 2 years and as we work ourselves through the back end of that right now. It just creates headwinds into the market. We tried to be as transparent with you as possible. We set our objectives and share our forecasts, and we have plans behind them to kind of make them, and then we got to fight through. And if new risks pop up, we got to find other opportunities. But clearly, we anticipate to incrementally expand our margin performance kind of going forward.
Noah Poponak : Appreciate that. Is it possible to give more specifics on maintaining margin and cash flow on CVN 79 while moving the schedule? Just if you could give us some more detail beyond how that happens. And is that true year-by-year in the remainder or just in the full aggregate of the remainder?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So -- as Tom mentioned in his remarks, we need to keep that financially neutral. And so as we come through that Class 1 change, that's the objective. So the team is working on ensuring that on an annual basis or an annualized basis, we keep cash and margin kind of in a neutral place and risk in a neutral place from where we were today.
Noah Poponak : Okay. And Tom, you walked through the good quarter at MT. But in your 2Q guide, you've got it back to flat year-over-year and the margin a little lower sequentially. Just what's behind that? And then I guess, maybe just what's your latest thinking on the longer-term margin potential of the segment?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. I think that's just being conservative on where we are in timing. We'll see how that plays out. The quick turn quarters, especially in that business where the contract duration is shorter, a potential for recompetes and wins and when programs top online and things of that nature. So I think it's just us being more conservative. At our position for Q1, the run rate that's 24.96, we guided 2.5 for the year. So I'm feeling good about that. It's the largest quarter by far that MT has had with a line on it, and the 5.8% growth is fantastic. And then each of the business units growing is a great sign, too. And that's 2 quarters in a row of that happening. So I think there's some really good positive signs there. We don't want to overcommit, and that business is highly competitive. There's a lot of proposal working there, plus $60 billion of proposals. So half of that's qualified, a lot of moving pieces on when things either get awarded or delayed or extended or option year exercised. So we're just being conservative on how that plays out. I do think as we -- as I mentioned about restructuring in the rear-view mirror and the team even more focused and experience working together over there, the additions of the Chief Technology Officer that we have here, Eric Tuning, has been from executive S&D, all those will help mature that portfolio over there. So I do anticipate that although it's highly -- the portfolio has a lot of cost-type contracts in it, I think we'll see as we move push for more products and services, more technology than just the service side, and that will have a natural lift to and the profitability in there. So the guide we gave you was 8% to 10% EBITDA when we purchased the line, and that construct still holds here and expectation that we'll grow that up over the next couple of years.
Chris Kastner: No. I would mention between Q1 and Q2, there are some contracts within Mission Technologies that are relatively lumpy in nature when you get -- when you book the margin. So that's why the lower guide in Q2 from a margin standpoint.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse.
Scott Deuschle : Tom, does the back half margin guide accommodate for the risk of additional negative EACs like we saw this quarter on CVN 80?
Tom Stiehle: So that's a very specific question. I would tell you that each quarter, once we come through our DAC analysis, we evaluate performance, existing costs, we update our projections going forward, value material labor cost, schedule and overheads, all that goes into the construct of coming up with the booking rate. And then from there, we update our sets of opportunities and risks against that forecast. And from there, we'll make a determination of what the forecast is for ourselves and out to The Street here. So I would tell you that there's always the potential to either exceed the forecast or underrun it. Specifically, we think we book the risk on the CVN 80 outsourcing project accordingly. So I would not anticipate that to to continue to bleed. If anything, I'd like to see us do better than what we have in the plan right now from a risk mitigation standpoint. But I think the guidance still holds that I gave you between 7%, 7% and 8%. The back half will be better, and we'll just watch that play out.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. And then, Chris, can you help reconcile the improved hiring and attrition trends you've noted with the increased outsourcing on CVN 80 that drove the negative EAC? I'm just trying to understand why you needed to do the unplanned outsourcing if hiring and attrition did track better.
Chris Kastner: Yes. That's a really good question. And -- so when you're putting in your plan, you're projecting what your workload is going to be and what your labor is going to be. And it just made good sense to, over the last year or so, put together outsourcing plans. And the risk showed up when we finally rationalized and realized the cost estimate for that outsourcing. We needed to incorporate it into our EACs. So it's all in the mix together, and it's all related. Still positive on the labor front, but we still needed to do that outsourcing on 80.
Scott Deuschle : Okay. And then last question, kind of bigger picture. But if you priced your fixed price contracts, assuming wage inflation would be at a low single-digit rate and it’s the mid- to high single-digit rate instead, I just – I’m trying to understand mechanically how this can still be a 9% margin business until you burn through a lot of the $47 billion backlog, which I assume would take another 4 to 5 years. Just trying to understand the mechanics of how that works in a chunk cost...
Chris Kastner: Sure. I can start and then potentially, Tom here. But remember, we do have EPA protection pretty at Ingalls and some EPA protection at Newport News. And we do have long-term labor agreements in place both at Newport News and Ingalls. So that mitigates it to some extent.
A –Tom Stiehle: Yes. I’d comment on that front, too. So yes, we do have the $47 billion of backlog. Only 55% of it’s funded, that’s one, right? So there’s other areas there, whether they’re going to get finalized, negotiated or exercised. Two is, as Chris said, about 45% of our workforce, we do have union agreements, so I know what I’m paying on that front. Much of the work we do, we’ve talked in the past about long lead contracts, advanced procurement contracts. So we really make sure we get current bids that we can both use in the proposal, get the advanced procurement turned on and then immediately exercise those bids and get the contractors locked into fixed price on the large material components. Most of Ingalls contracts have EPS provisions, which is 90-10 fixed price and then the Newport News where it’s more 50-50 cost type. The cost will be recognized on, I guess, those cost contracts. So a lot of things are in play. I’m with you that there was an expectation on inflation and for any long long-term contract that was put on before. Without EPA, the material could have some exposure. These are the headwinds that we talk about that we try and fight through. But then there’s other avenues and ways to get the contract adjustments, incentives, work-through, workaround or realize more opportunity than risk to still maintain and improve our profitability.
Operator: I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Kastner for any closing remarks.
Chris Kastner : All right. Thank you for your interest in HII today. We look forward to continuing to engage with all of you. Thank you.
Tom Stiehle: Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-09 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2022 HII Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.

Chris Kastner: Thanks, Christie. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. First, I would like to thank the entire HII team for a solid year and express my gratitude for their outstanding contributions throughout 2022. It was through their dedication and commitment that we were able to deliver results that demonstrated consistent performance in a pretty tough economic environment. Now let’s turn to the highlights for the quarter and the year on page three of the presentation. In 2022, we reported record sales of $10.7 billion, net earnings of $579 million and free cash flow of $494 million. The demand for our products continues to drive a tremendous backlog of $47 billion and we grew sales and earnings across all three of our segments in 2022, setting the foundation for continued growth in 2023 and beyond. At Ingalls, in the fourth quarter, we delivered DDG 123 Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee and completed builder’s trials on DDG 125 Jack H. Lucas, the first Flight III ship just one quarter after DDG 123 completed her trials. Our DDG 51 team also started fabrication on DDG 133 Sam Nunn. In our amphibious ship product line, we were awarded a $2.4 billion detailed design and construction contract and started fabrication for LHA 9 Fallujah, the fourth big deck amphibious warship in the America class. Also at Ingalls, in January, we were awarded the advanced planning contract for the modernization period for Zumwalt-class guided missile destroyers. At Newport News in the fourth quarter, we authenticated a keel for SSN 800 Arkansas, honoring the ship sponsors to Little Rock 9. We continue to remain focused on reducing risk and meeting cost and schedule objectives on the Virginia-class boats. As for nuclear aircraft carrier, CVN 79 Kennedy is well into the test program. Distributed systems such as fire main, potable water, air conditioning and ventilation are coming to life. The EMALS Catapult system, which we began testing in 2022 remains on track and is progressing as planned through her test program and we expect to enter into the Combat Systems Test program later this quarter. And finally, for the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 73 USS George Washington, we are 98% complete as we near planned re-delivery later this year. At Mission Technologies, we achieved solid revenue growth for 2022, with all of the business groups growing year-over-year and we ended the year with a robust potential business pipeline of $66 billion, of which over one-third is qualified. Significant wins in 2022 included, the Decisive Mission Actions and Technology Services contract, Mobility Air Forces Distributed Mission Operations contract and the Remus 300 selection as the U.S. Navy as small UUV program of record. From an operational perspective, we have integrated Alion into our Mission Technologies and HII team and with the integration complete, we can turn our full attention towards executing our growth strategy. Moving on to slide four. We are providing the major milestones for 2023 and 2024. I am proud to say that we met all of the Shipbuilding milestones that we highlighted back in the second quarter of last year for 2022 and we are maintaining all of the 2023 milestones. This demonstrates growing confidence in our ship schedules and provides a solid platform to continue to improve our cost performance. Notable anticipated 2023 milestones at Newport News include the planned delivery of SSN 796 New Jersey and planned float off of SSN 798 Massachusetts, as well as the planned re-delivery of CVN 73 and planned crew move aboard on CVN 79. At Ingalls, DDG 125, NSC 10 Calhoun and LPD 29 Richard M. McCool Jr. are all forecast to deliver this year, while LHA 8 Bougainville is expected to launch. In addition to these Shipbuilding milestones, Mission Technologies expects to see continued growth resulting from our large opportunity pipeline, including the several award decisions that we expect to be made in the first half of the year. Now I would like to discuss our operational focus areas. Our top operational priority remains hiring and workforce development. I am confident in our plans for hiring, and as importantly, our retention and training strategies. These strategies that center around employee skills and leadership development are gaining traction and we have had a good start to the year. After hiring over 4,900 craft personnel in 2022, we expect a similar hiring rate in 2023, while at the same time, improving our productivity, attendance and over time together to drive performance. Regarding inflation, we have some installation through our contracting terms and conditions. However, non-programmatic elements of inflation have impacted us across all of our programs. And finally, the supply chain is stabilizing and we have worked closely with our customers and suppliers to achieve the best possible schedules. To summarize and notwithstanding being our most significant risk, as labor and supply chain impacts continue to stabilize and inflation abate, we believe we have the opportunity for improved performance over the next few years. Turning to the budget environment, we are pleased with the passage and enactment of the fiscal year 2023 Defense Appropriations and Defense Authorization Bills. Both pieces of legislation strongly support Shipbuilding, including funding and authority for an additional DDG 51 Flight III ship for a total of three DDGs, 2 Virginia-class attack submarines, the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program, Ford-class nuclear aircraft carrier programs and the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 74 John C. Stennis. Both Appropriations and Authorization Bills continue funding for LPD 32 and LHA 9 and provide new advanced procurement funding for LPD 33, LHA 10 and a third DDG 51 in FY 2024. The Defense Authorization Act also includes language requiring a naval fleet of no less than 31 operational amphibious warships, including a minimum of 10 amphibious assault ships. We continue to see bipartisan congressional support for our programs. We look forward to working with the administration and Congress on the President’s fiscal year 2024 budget request. So, with that, I will turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financial results and guidance, and then I have a few additional comments before we move on to Q&A.
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our fourth quarter and full year results and also provide an outlook for 2023. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated fourth quarter results on slide five of the presentation. Our fourth quarter revenues of $2.8 billion increased approximately 5% compared to the same period last year. This growth was driven by higher year-over-year revenue at all three segments, leading to record quarterly revenue for HII. Operating income for the quarter of $105 million decreased by $15 million or 12.5% from the fourth quarter of 2021 and operating margin of 3.7%, compared to margin of 4.5% in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower segment operating income. Net earnings in the quarter were $123 million, compared to $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.07, compared to $2.99 in the fourth quarter of the previous year. Moving to our consolidated results for the full year on slide six, revenues were $10.7 billion for the year, an increase of 12.1% from 2021. The increase was driven by year-over-year growth at all three segments, along with a full year of Alion revenue. Operating income for the year was $565 million and operating margin was 5.3%. This compares to operating income of $513 million and operating margin of 5.4% in 2021. The operating income growth was driven by year-over-year improvement at all three segments, as well as a more favorable non-current state income taxes and operating FAS/CAS adjustment. Net earnings for the year were $579 million, compared to $544 million in 2021 and diluted earnings per share were $14.44, compared to $13.50 in the previous year. Moving on to slide seven. Ingalls’ 2022 revenues of $2.6 billion increased $42 million or 1.7% from 2021, driven primarily by higher revenues in the LHA and DDG programs, partially offset by lower NSC program revenues. Ingalls’ 2022 operating income of $292 million and margin of 11.4%, both improved from $281 million and 11.1% last year. These results were driven primarily by favorable changes in contract estimates and price adjustment clauses, as well as higher risk retirement on the LPD program, partially offset by lower risk retirement on the DDG program compared to 2021. At Newport News, 2022 revenues of $5.9 billion increased by $189 million or 3.3% from 2021, primarily due to higher revenues in both aircraft carriers and submarines, partially offset by a lower revenue in naval nuclear support services. Increased aircraft carrier revenues were driven by higher volumes on the refueling and complex overhaul of the USS John C. Stennis CVN 74 and the construction of Doris Miller CVN 81 and Enterprise CVN 80, partially offset by lower volumes on the refueling and overhaul of the USS George Washington CVN 73 and USS Gerald R. Ford CVN 78. Submarine revenue growth was due to higher volumes on the Columbia-class and Block V boats on the Virginia-class, partially offset by lower volumes on the Virginia-class Block IV boats. Newport News 2022 operating income of $357 million and margin of 6.1% were relatively consistent with the performance in 2021 of $352 million and margin of 6.2%. 2022 results included favorable changes in contract estimates from facilities, capital and price adjustment clauses, as well as contract incentives on the Columbia-class submarine program, partially offset by lower risk retirement on the VCS program and the refueling overhaul of the USS George Washington CVN 73 compared to 2021. 2022 Shipbuilding margin of 7.7% was consistent with the performance of 2021, but below our expectations for year-over-year improvement, as the back half of the year provided limited risk retirement opportunities. Continued labor challenges, including high attrition rates, the impact of non-programmatic inflation and supply chain disruption all contributed to slower margin progress. At Mission Technologies, revenues of $2.4 billion increased $911 million or 61.7% from 2021, primarily driven by the acquisition of Alion in the third quarter of 2021. Mission Technologies’ operating income of $63 million compares to operating income of $50 million in 2021. Primary drivers of growth are the acquisition of Alion in 2021, as well as higher equity income from a joint venture, partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangible assets in 2022 due to the Alion acquisition. 2022 results included approximately $96 million of amortization of Alion-related purchased intangibles compared to approximately $33 million in 2021. I will also note that the fourth quarter and 2022 results included a non-cash downward valuation adjustment of approximately $10 million or approximately $0.20 per share related to an equity method investment. Mission Technologies’ EBITDA margin in 2022 was 8.2% and adjusting out the onetime downward valuation adjustment, EBITDA margin was 8.6%, consistent with 2021 performance. Turning to capital deployment on slide eight. We ended 2022 with a cash balance of $467 million and liquidity of approximately $2 billion. 2022 cash from operations was $766 million and free cash flow was $494 million. Free cash flow generated in the fourth quarter of 2022 was significantly above our prior expectations, as we were able to accelerate several large cash collection events. This has a direct impact on our expectation for 2023 free cash flow, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. I am pleased to report that the net capital expenditures were $272 million or 2.5% of revenues in 2022 at the very bottom end of the guidance range. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $41 million in 2022. During the fourth quarter, we paid dividends of $1.24 per share or $50 million bringing total dividends paid for the year to $192 million. Over the course of 2022, we repurchased approximately 245,000 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $52 million. Moving on to slide nine and our updated outlook for pension and post-retirement benefits. Our outlook for 2023 has improved modestly from the update we provided in November, given the increase in discount rates since that time. Asset returns for 2022 of negative 16.1% or about as expected compared to our update in the third quarter. Expectations for 2024 through 2026 have been updated and consistent with the Q3 update, the FAS benefit has come down considerably from our last update given the more immediate recognition of the negative asset returns experienced in 2022. This is partially offset by the impact of higher discount rate. We also have provided an initial review of our 2027 expectations. Turning to slide 10 and our outlook for 2023, while we continue to expect Shipbuilding growth of approximately 3% over time, our 2023 outlook range of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion acknowledges uncertainties around the current environment, particularly the labor challenges we have discussed. For 2023, we expect Shipbuilding operating margin between 7.7% and 8%, as we continue to target incremental margin improvement, but acknowledge the current challenges have tempered the pace of that progress. For Mission Technologies, we expect 2023 revenue of approximately $2.5 billion, organic growth of approximately 5% year-over-year. We expect operating margins of between 2.5% and 3% and EBITDA margins of between 8% and 8.5%. In 2023, amortization of purchased intangible assets is expected to total approximately $128 million, of which $109 million is attributable to Mission Technologies. We expect 2023 capital expenditures to be approximately 3% of sales. Moving on to expectations for the first quarter of 2023, we expect overall revenue growth for the first quarter to be quite modest given normal seasonality in Mission Technologies and the strong fourth quarter performance for Shipbuilding, which benefited from favorable material timing. Additionally, given the timing of the Shipbuilding program milestones and the mentioned Mission Technology seasonality, we expect first quarter segment operating results to be the weakest of the year, with the Shipbuilding operating margin near 7% and Mission Technologies operating margin near 1%. The outlook we are providing today is based on the best information we currently have and assumes no further degradation in our supply chain, that non-programmatic impact from inflation continue to abate, and most importantly, that we are able to continue to hire and retain employees at a pace that supports our staffing plan. Additionally, on slide 10, we have provided our updated outlook for a number of other discrete items to assist with your modeling. On slide 11, we have provided an update -- updated view on our free cash flow expectations through 2024, consistent with how we presented this data in the third quarter, this outlook assumes the current R&D amortization treatment for tax purposes remains in place and we are reaffirming the $2.9 billion target. If Section 174 is deferred or repealed, all else equal, there would be an opportunity of approximately $215 million in total over the cost of 2023 and 2024. As I noted earlier, we significantly outperformed our 2022 free cash flow expectation of approximately $350 million by accelerating collections. This timing difference, along with the delay of the planned COVID-19 repayment now into this year have impacted 2023 free cash flow expectations. Consistent with our normal seasonality, we expect the first quarter of 2023 free cash flow will be the weakest of the year and given the pull-forward of collections into the fourth quarter of 2022 is likely to be an outflow of $200 million to $300 million. Our free cash flow expectation for 2024 remains unchanged, as it will not be burdened by COVID-19 repayment, will benefit from continued topline growth, and margin expansion potential as compared to 2022. Additionally, we expect to see sub-6% working capital levels as a percentage of sales in 2024. We are reaffirming our capital allocation priorities focused on debt paydown, which is on pace to retire about the $400 million bond this year and the remainder of our Alion acquisition term loan in 2024, and our commitment to return substantially all free cash flow after planned debt repayment to shareholders through 2024. To close my remarks, it was no doubt a challenging year, but I am proud of the entire HII team and the important work we accomplished across the business, from successfully meeting all of our planned Shipbuilding milestones to the critical integration work that was completed timely and under budget at Mission Technologies. Across the enterprise, we made meaningful progress in 2022, which resulted in growth across all segments and free cash flow results that were well ahead of our projections. We entered 2023 intent on driving execution and are well positioned to deliver profitable growth. With that, I will turn the call back over to Chris for some final remarks before we take your questions.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Tom. In summary, we delivered consistent results in 2022 and we believe we are well positioned to grow in markets of critical importance to our customers, while executing on almost $50 billion of backlog in 2023 and beyond. We will continue to make long-term strategic decisions that benefit our employees, customers and shareholders, creating long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Now I will turn the call over to Christie for Q&A.
Christie Thomas: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Myles. Your line is now open.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Hi, Myles.
Myles Walton: The first one, maybe at a high level, is this still a 9% plus Shipbuilding margin business?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. Definitely. I believe that we have come through some challenging times with COVID and we have got some ships that are still working through that. Ingalls is obviously north of that and Newport News is making great strides. And I think the biggest issue we can work on a Newport News is simply work in the operating system, getting the Block IV boats delivered over the next two years and three years and transitioning to Block V. So, yeah, absolutely, it’s a 9% business. I am not going to give a forecast for when that’s going to happen, but I do expect performance to continue to improve from here.
Myles Walton: Okay. And then, Chris or Tom, I don’t know, in terms of the plug for capital deployment for share repurchase, I guess, it’s $250 million to $300 million in 2023, 2024 is what you plan to do. Do you have any sights on doing that a little bit earlier or do you have to wait until 2024 as big cash flow come through to have confidence to execute against it?
Tom Stiehle: Yeah. Myles, this is Tom. We haven’t given an exact number, obviously, if you work yourself through the math of where we are, expectations on the revenue and the margin expansion, the free cash flow bridges that we have given you and then the capital expense as long -- as well as with the working capital, the numbers fall that way. So as we work ourselves through the year, we -- the cash is generated. We anticipate to continue to buy back shares as we see value in the share price. But we haven’t really guided on how that is going to be portioned over 2023, 2024. We stand behind our commitment to that all excess free cash flow will be given back to the shareholders after debt repayment schedule.
Myles Walton: And then just one clarification, what is non-programmatic inflation?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So I will give you an example of that, Myles. It’s related to expenses towards the end of the year that we didn’t -- that the actuals were higher than what we forecast, stuff like medical benefits, the insurance premiums, we just didn’t get that right.
Tom Stiehle: And we have seen tight marketing expense [ph].
Myles Walton: All right. Thank you.
Tom Stiehle: Yeah. Sure. So it’s overhead tight expenses for us.
Myles Walton: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead, Robert. Your line is now open.
Robert Spingarn: Hi. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Rob.
Tom Stiehle: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Chris, you talked a lot about the labor constraint and I wanted to see if you could give us some granularity as to how that number splits between the two shipyards and Mission Technologies. One thing I have noted is if we look at your job postings, it seems like Newport News has 10x the openings of Ingalls and does that factor into the margins there?
Chris Kastner: Not really. I will -- Mission Technologies is pretty stable, adding throughout the year with really industry standard attrition rates in a very competitive market. We plan to add about 5,000 shipbuilders throughout the year and then there are some positive indications in not only hiring, but also over time, attendance and attrition. So there are some positive indicators. I wouldn’t necessarily relate it back to margin. Newport News will hire more this year than Ingalls. We don’t break that out separately. But I wouldn’t necessarily relate that back to margin, no.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that, could there be upside to the 3% topline growth if Congress appropriated more funds to expand shipyard capacity and the fund training and apprenticeship programs?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. But the constraint is labor. Our shipyards are facilitized to grow in excess really of that 3% and -- but we need to be conservative and how we project -- how we are going to add labor over the next few years. But is there upside? Yes, of course.
Robert Spingarn: Yeah. I guess I am asking you is can they help you attract labor faster and train labor faster. The benefit to get the ship...
Chris Kastner: Yeah. Interesting enough, there’s a lot of initiatives both at the state and federal level to help in workforce development. And we are actively communicating with both states that are involved in that and the federal government for infrastructure and workforce development support.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thanks, Chris.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Scott Deuschle: Hey. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Deuschle: Tom, did CVN 79 book a net-net negative EAC in Q4? Just trying to interpret what’s in the press release on the year-over-year comparison there? Thanks.
Tom Stiehle: Yeah. So we don’t provide the actual margin booking rates to step up, so step backs on any individual program. I would tell you -- to give you some color on that, on the adjustments, there was nothing significant either are up or down on any individual program. So the answer to your question is no on that. I would tell you that the effect that you are seeing at Newport News there is, although it’s net down as far as the adjustments it has, it was really a function of not having the upside that we would normally see. So if you kind of range bound to what we saw on the downside of EAC adjustments, because the timing on the milestones and just where they saw a little bit of a draw short on labor, a little bit of pressure on overhead costs, overhead absorption is a little bit higher on all the programs there and CVN 79 is not immune to that effect as well. But it was not significant enough as you see it’s not called out in the K.
Chris Kastner: Scott, I’d also add that…
Scott Deuschle: Okay.
Chris Kastner: … CVN 79 had a pretty solid year. They met their compartment commitments for the year, EMALS is essentially built out. It’s pretty amazing. I was up there last week and the equipment is in and they started that test program. The topside test program has begun. So they have got a bit of momentum. I hate to use football reference, but the big game is this weekend, but 79 is what I call four yards in a cloud of dust, right? They are -- every week they are executing on a lot of volume work. They met their commitments for last year. They have got a lot of work in front of them, but I have high hopes for success on that program.
Scott Deuschle: Great. And then, Chris, what were the, sorry, if I missed this, but what were the gross and net headcount additions in the Shipbuilding business in 2022 and then just curious on how attrition trended in Q4 sequentially relative to Q3? Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So attrition got better throughout the year. I don’t have the specific number here. We added about 5,000 heads, but it did trend better as we move through the year and it’s gotten better in January as well. It’s pretty -- it’s what I call this a bit of stability showing up in the Shipbuilding organizations from not only a labor standpoint, but also supply chain and inflation. It’s not back to pre-pandemic levels, but it’s definitely stabilized and that’s what we need to execute.
Scott Deuschle: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Pete Skibitski: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Chris Kastner: Hi.
Pete Skibitski: Just going back to Kennedy, it’s a big contract for you guys at fixed price, and I was just wondering, my recollection was 2023, 2024, you guys are going to have some big risk milestones on that project. It sounds like that’s still going to happen. But is just the labor situation has kind of eaten up the upside on that potential risk retirement, is that the right way to think about it?
Chris Kastner: I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s eating up all the upside. I would say that we are very conservative in how we deal with the EAC and there’s a lot of really complex work in front of us. So I would not necessarily say it’s eating up all the upside.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. Okay. Just a follow-up to that, in Newport News, is VCS Block IV the bigger muscle mover margin wise? Is that kind of -- is the Block IV kind of roll-off over the next two years? Does that just give you a lot more relief than anything else?
Chris Kastner: It will definitely give us a lot more confidence moving forward after we get those Block IV boats delivered and transition into Block V.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. And Chris, just on that, it’s -- obviously, labor impacts all your programs, but Block IV had kind of the unusually aggressive schedule. Is that a combination why that’s been such kind of a door on your side, is that fair?
Chris Kastner: Well, remember, Block IV was impacted the most by COVID, right? We had a pretty material impact back in 2020, which really reduced our profit expectations on those boats. So we just need to get through them. We need to get them delivered. The program schedules are pretty stable right now and a lot of cooperation between electric boat Newport News and really senior Navy to get through those program schedules. So we just need to get through them and then we will transition into Block V.
Tom Stiehle: Chris, if I could hop on that too. Pete, so on that, to your question of IV or V, yeah, Block IV has been with COVID in 2021, 2022. So it’s long run rate, those contracts have had in the EACs with some additional costs. I think it’s two-fold. One, getting those Block IV boats done alleviates the mix in the portfolio at Newport News, so there’s a list that you talked about there. But then also it’s just -- those boats give us time to come down the learning curve, the lessons learned, the metrics and the operating system and the pressure on that we have on boat there. It truly is a production line of all programs you have, it’s the most serial production line with the modules go and then the boats are there, some will go from unit-to-unit with the same personnel. So getting through IV and then that kind of benefit lifts the Block V, which has higher profit potential. And then it will take the preponderance of the portfolio mix at Newport News. We crossed over the end of last year. So already now the sales proportion between Block IV and V is now more in V and IV. So there’s going to be a natural progression of improvement with learning for boats being accomplished and then that learning and higher profit potential on Block V is going to be affecting the New Port’s portfolio.
Pete Skibitski: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Tom Stiehle: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead, David. Your line is now open.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
David Strauss: Tom, I have similar question that I have asked in the past around working capital. I mean you obviously had a big improvement in working capital in the fourth quarter. Looks like in your guide for cash, I guess, back into that, it looks like you are assuming relatively neutral working capital for 2024, is that correct or sorry, for 2023. And then could you help bridge us how you go from $400 million and $400 million, $450 million in cash to -- in 2023 to the number you are looking at in 2024, I guess, maybe a little bit of CapEx help, but what else gets us there?
Tom Stiehle: Sure. Yes. I will break that down. I have several points I want to hit. I will hit the percentage on working capital last as I walk you through that. So we have updated on slide 11 of the PowerPoint presentation there. So we finished at $494 million, pretty healthy against an expectation of start the year at $300 million to $350 million, we pulled that down to $200 million to $250 million kind of midyear with the re-guide and then Q3 we told you $350 million, we finished $494 million with healthy free cash flow in 2022. Obviously, that pulls ahead a little bit and so we have taken down the 2023 expectation. We hedge our $545 million to $595 million or midpoint of $570 million last time we discussed and because of the pull ahead that we have here right now, we reset expectations of $400 million to $450 million. You -- to your point of working capital, you are right, just a couple of quarters ago, we were at 11.1%, last quarter we were in the 10% range and we finished 2022 up at 6.1% of working capital. As we have been guiding over the last three years or four years, we saw that the workload and just the cadence of the ships, we are going to have more deliveries and launches on the back half of the five-year free cash flow commitment in the front half and that’s exactly what we see here. If you look at the milestone chart, you will see that we are going from three deliveries in 2022 to five deliveries in 2023. We also have three launches in 2023. So that’s a pretty big year. And then kind of it going forward to the following year on that, we take that perspective up and we have two deliveries and three launches in 2024. So a lot of activity there, which will continue us leading the working capital, getting rid of the retention that we have and helping in the free cash flow lift as we go forward. Also, I would tell you that, as much as we finished up at 6.1% on working capital, it will just grow a little bit. We have got a couple of advancements on incentives that we have had. So we will go from 6.1% to about 6.5-ish working capital in 2023. So more deliveries helped slight rise in working capital in 2023 slightly hurts. We re-guided on CapEx from 2.5% to 3%, so a couple of dollars of headwinds there. So two things against us, but with all those deliveries and launches, we will see working capital finish up around $425 million. And mind you, 2023 has to repay COVID, which right now is about $125 million, right? The way I look at it and give you confidence on where we are going with that. We have three years in the whole now against the five-year commitment, $757 million, $449 million and $494 million, that averages out to $567 million straight stick at BSC about $600 million a year that you need. So we are running behind for the first three years, but we knew there was a natural grant with retention with revenue and margin expansion. And also we have Alion on board now. 2022 we had them onboard for the first year. I was happy with the contribution they made. If you recall, we took the $3 billion to $3.2 billion with Alion and I am happy with the contribution they made in 2022 and Alion will be on board for 2023, 2024. As we look -- going forward, right, EBITDA margin stay flat from 2021 to 2022. We are foreshadowing some margin expansion into 2023. We have the topline growing in Shipbuilding right now that we gave you in the guidance $486 million and we expect we will continue incrementally guiding higher revenue and margin into 2024. And also I’d ask you to take a look at the three years that we have had, the $757 million, $449 million and $494 million free cash flow. That $757 million really had two things that actually helped it, and if you normalize it out, how to make sense of how we are marching to be north of $700 million in free cash flow as we get out to the 2024 timeframe, but the $757 million had the FICA release, which was $130 million and it also has the COVID repayment benefit for $160 million. So $160 million and $130 million is $290 million. $290 million of the $757 million is about $467 million is really how I look at the first of the three years, $467 million. The $449 million to 2021 has the FICA repay in it. So you throw another $65 million in that, that’s about $510 million for a normalized 2021 and now for 2022, $494 million, there’s $65 million of FICA in that too, that’s $550 million. So I really look at it, we have normalize for what we have seen because of COVID with FICA and repay, it’s more like a match of $460-ish million to $510 million last year to $555 million, $550 million this year. The guide we gave you is $450 million for 2023 only because I have the COVID repay. So it’s another with $125 million on top of the midpoint, that’s a $550 million year and I have the year in front of me to burn down risk and pulling cash. So I am comfortable with how margin passed by average of $567 million in the first three years. And then the last piece on how we get that up to, how do you get to $780 million is the working capital we see is going to swing about 2 points down. As I mentioned earlier, we finished 6.1% 2022, we will be in the mid-6s for 2023 and then it’s going to swing down below 5% for 2024 and 2 points of margin against the topline of $10.8 million, is about $200 million. So $550 million plus $200 million is $750 million. I got you at the midpoint of $780 million, because we still have revenue growth and margin expansion. So I am quite comfortable with where we are right now. The numbers play out. If you have any questions, you can -- as we have our calls afterwards, we can break that down for you further.
David Strauss: Okay. That’s a lot of detail. Thank you for that. And Chris, as a follow-up on Mission Technologies, the EBITDA margin there, which I guess is the right way to look at 18.5%. How do we think about those as longer term? I mean those are well below kind of what we see out of typical kind of services companies and you pitch this is not just your typical kind of services business. So how do we think about those EBITDA margin, I guess, the potential there? Thanks.
Chris Kastner: Yeah. Thanks, David. You have to remember that the vast majority of that work is cost plus. So that would indicate that you would have a lower EBITDA percentage. I do think there’s opportunity for upside as we present more solutions and move into a fixed price sort of arrangement. We are not prepared to say that it’s going to get better than that right now, but there is opportunity for improvement and that’s something we are evaluating.
David Strauss: Thank you.
Tom Stiehle: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned from AllianceBernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Doug Harned: Great. Thank you. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Tom Stiehle: Good morning.
Doug Harned: So I want to go back to Newport News and you had a 5.1% margin this quarter. That follows Q3 that if I take out the Columbia-class benefit, that was 4.1%. And what I want to understand is you have still got certainly the Massachusetts and the New Jersey flowing through there. And so the work that you have done on Block IV where you have taken charges in the past, I mean, how much of this, what I would call, kind of a low margin in Newport News is due to the overhang of those past charges. So then when you get out from under those, should we expect a step up?
Chris Kastner: Well, yeah, Doug, this is Chris. I will start and then Tom can jump in there. There’s absolutely an overhang related to Block IV boats that we are dealing with and so we should expect a margin step up. Now we haven’t guided beyond 2023 and we need to be conservative, because we need to make sure the labor shows up and we get them trained up and they go execute. But I think you are right, relative to that overhang on Block IV, so we need to get those delivered. And as I said previously, those schedules are being very consistent right now. Cost performance, we are working on every day. Go ahead, Tom.
Tom Stiehle: Sure. If I can hop on the back of that, right? So we talked about Block IV here and what we took back in Q2 of 2020, I would tell you the portfolio with Colombia that’s coming on board and sales. So that’s a new stock program that’s booking along right now across that contract. I have some change, change in unadjudicated change that still has to get proposed and pushed through the system. So that’s going to increase, we are very conservative on that until those unadjudicated changes are definitized. That’s boat RC 73 and 74 as is in infancy too both cost type contracts. So the portfolio just has a little bit higher level of that as we see it. And then, lastly, I think, as we go forward, burn down risk as 79 marches to its completion, as Chris said earlier, there’s a potential with good performance there for additional upside here. So I think we just find ourselves in a situation where the ships are right now, not too many milestones, a little bit of drag on overhead, down on labor. And I think we are booking prudently to conservatively right now as we want to see us pushing ships over the goal line. Those deliveries I mentioned is two each for 2023 and 2024, and I think, that will assist in the margin list, as well as Block IV gets small in the portfolio mix with the potential of Block V as we move forward. I think the Columbia program will mature and with 73 out of here at this year, a 74 focus and maturity will assist the portfolio of profitability as well.
Doug Harned: So if I have it right, then Block IV, the overhang of these past charges is a contributor, but there’s still other -- there are a number of other things you just raised. So it’s sort of a blend of things that you are working through. I just wondered General Dynamics when they did their Q4 call and highlighted the number of issues that somewhat similar related to labor across shipyards and they did mention Virginia-class. Can you talk about how you are working with electric boat sort of together to deal with these problems and if they have been changed over time and how the -- how you work together and work through attrition issues…
Chris Kastner: Yeah.
Doug Harned: … inflation, all these sorts of things.
Chris Kastner: Thank you for that question, Doug. It’s an important one. The Newport News and EV team, they work very closely together in understanding when the work, what work and how that work gets executed. So there could be movement of work between the yards where it’s most efficiently done if there’s labor issues and they are working very closely together. Their objectives are completely aligned to deliver all the Block IV boats. And I would add also the Navy is engaged as well. It’s all from the deck plate to the senior executive force. Everybody is all in and all of our objectives are aligned to get those Block IV boats delivered. And I will say that we are fully staffed on Block IV and Colombia, and we are working very hard on execution there. And not only is a Newport News working between each other, but working to ensure that any sort of outsourcing is effectively managed to ensure that we get -- that we meet our production schedules.
Doug Harned: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Chris Kastner: Gautam, are you out there. Are you on mute, Gautam?
Operator: Unfortunately, we are not getting any audio from the line. So we will move on to the next question. And our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Yes. Good morning.
Tom Stiehle: Good morning, George.
George Shapiro: I was curious that you wound up with 7.7% Shipbuilding margins and when you did the third quarter call in early November, you were looking for 8% to 8.1%. So just wondering what you missed here in two months, because I thought that Shipbuilding would be somewhat predictable sort of business?
Tom Stiehle: Yeah. It was just the drag that we talked about at the end of the year. We had a strong first half of the year over 9% and we guided to 7% for the back half of the year and even Q3 was in that lane and we thought that the remaining 13 weeks of the year, we had that. But the shortfall of labor that we saw, a couple of the overhead or the non-programmatic issues drove hit boat yards actually on the cost that we talked about, on medical and just that shortfall as we go through and take a look at EAC performance and then the cost and how overheads flow through there, there’s a little bit of a drag on where we thought we would land. So if you call it on the call, I was focused on saying I want to see how the year plays out. We did stay on the guide at 8% to 8.1% and we thought we could get that home. But as the EACs kind of rolled up, there was just a little bit of a drag. I would say both to this question, George, and the previous one. From a Newport News perspective, 6.2% last year, 6.1% this year, about the same type of performance overall, if you think about it, another year with some drag upfront, with the effects of COVID and then supply chain, inflation, big year on inflation and then the hiring demands that we had here. So I am quite comfortable with promise as far as what the Newport News team accomplished it. But to your point, we thought we would get that home and Q4 came in a little flattish on Newport News than we expected.
George Shapiro: And Tom, did you give the EACs for the quarter?
Tom Stiehle: Not yet, but I can. No. I did, yeah. I referenced them, just that we didn’t have a tremendous downside. We just didn’t have upsides at Newport News. But from a -- for the quarter perspective, what we saw was the gross favorable were $29 million, the gross unfavorable were $56 million. That was a net of $27 million. And effectively, about 100% of that was at Newport News, basically Neutral Ingalls and Mission Technologies. So it was quiet at the other two divisions and Newport News saw a net down of that unfavorable for the corporation of 27 now.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, George.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Seth. Your line is now open.
Seth Seifman: Hey. Thanks very much and good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Seth.
Seth Seifman: Just maybe to follow up on that -- good morning. Maybe to follow up on that question, Tom, you talked about Newport News being in the low 6s for 2022 and 2021. I know you guys don’t typically guide segment margins. But if we are just to think kind of maybe qualitatively, overall Shipbuilding margins should be up 10 basis points to 20 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance. Does that mean there’s a little bit of improvement in each yard or given the way that some of the one-timers or some of the potential upside associated with the milestones that you are expecting at the shipyards. Is there opportunity for more expansion import news and maybe some headwinds in Ingalls? How do we think about that for this year?
Chris Kastner: So I will start and then Tom can get into the details and thank you for saying we don’t guide by shipyards. We don’t do that. But I firmly expect Newport News will be better this year. I think they are executing their operating system very well. I think labor is more stable. I think the supply chain is more stable. I think the team has some momentum and I think Newport News is going to do better this year. So, with that, Thomas, you want to add anything about Ingalls, I think, they are pretty stable as well.
Tom Stiehle: I am with you that we don’t guide by division, but from a historical perspective, things 10.5, 11, 11.1 for the last three years, they have the same portfolio basically done there finding labor overheads, the pressures that we talked about, but very strong operating team, a leadership. They know what they are building, those ships are under production. So I would think historically, they are going to continue perform well. And I think from a Newport News perspective, as they just fight it way through here, new technology started with Ford and now Colombia. We had that booking we talked about back in 2020, a little bit of COVID pressure, inflation, supply chain and hiring. But you can see some stabilization both in the performance over the last two years. We see stabilization and some stability in hiring and the schedule here and our expectation is that that yard can perform better. So I would expect that to increase as we go forward in the year here too.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Great. Great. And then maybe to follow up real quick on a similar type of question on Mission Technology, I think you said, the EBITDA margin there ex the valuation allowance was like 8.6% in 2022 and so what’s driving it down in 2023?
Tom Stiehle: We are probably just being conservative on the guide. So we had a 6.6% quarter with the impairment out of it, it was 8.3%. We have had quarters at Mission Technology anywhere from the low 8s to the low 9s. Last year was 8.6%. And as I said, adjusted it -- was unadjusted was 8% to 8.6% right now. So I think it’s just a function of net sales base. We have fixed and semi-variable costs there. It’s a good sized operation. We think we have the right people on board with the right strategy. The pipeline has grown year-over-year and the pipeline is more mature. And I think with the Mission Technologies integration into the HII family, with that behind us, as I mentioned in my notes, it was done under budget and is on time. That the team can completely focus on that pipeline, bids, execution and performance. So I think the 8% to 8.5% is just being conservative. Obviously, we want to see a couple of more dollars out of that division last year. We are guiding growth year-over-year right now. We did see Mission Technologies to grow 4% from 2021 to 2022 and each of the business units had growth in them. So those are all positive signs. I think the 8% to 8.5% is just waiting and seeing the awards happen. When the sales hit, I would expect we are going to be on the upper end of that range, if not over it.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thank you very much.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Seth.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Gautam Khanna: Hey. Sorry about that. I hope you can hear me.
Chris Kastner: No. Yeah. Thanks. Now we had you, Gautam.
Gautam Khanna: Great. Great. Hey. Thanks. I was curious if you could just give us some color on the timing of the milestones through the year. If you can tell us like, if there’s anything that’s in the month of December that has the potential to move out or things we should be watching…
Chris Kastner: Yeah. Just…
Gautam Khanna: … in terms of Q4 the way things happened [ph]
Chris Kastner: Sure. Sure, Gautam. When you look at the 2023 milestones, I think, Tom already mentioned that Q1 was pretty light. The pretty evenly distributed across Q2 and Q3, but then CVN 79, excuse me, LPD 29, yeah, is in Q4. So that’s at the end of the year. So that’s the one we will have to watch. We got a lot of confidence in and the team down in Mississippi, but that’s the one towards the end of the year.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. Thank you. And then just curious on VCS, anything incremental from last quarter on schedule with respect to...
Chris Kastner: Not really. Pretty stable from a schedule standpoint on the VCS program. We have movement here and there, but it’s pretty stable. I got to hand it to that team, the program team and the construction team. They are getting after it and they are learning every day. So it’s been pretty stable. We need to stay on.
Tom Stiehle: Chris has talked about that rhythm of the program, launch one and sell one-off when we saw that in 2022 and in the milestones, you will see that in 2023 and 2024. So we are working it.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And just on that last point, anything with respect to negative catch-ups or you can talk about 422 on VCS in aggregate anything, yeah, you can never call it out as material, but can we assume that there were kind of consistent negative marks in the program or anything you can tell us about that?
Tom Stiehle: Nothing really significant to highlight here. I mean I mentioned in the keel the -- the keel net was at Newport News on that, which was down and they just kind of sprinkled over the programs, but there was nothing really to highlight here.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Chris Kastner: All right, Gautam.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Noah. Your line is now open.
Noah Poponak: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Chris Kastner: Hi, Noah. Thanks for joining.
Noah Poponak: Yeah. Sure. Tom, so just back to the cash flow breakdown and appreciate all the detail you gave there and I appreciate that there are a lot of moving pieces. But if I just kind of zoom out on the cash flow statement and look at a long history, it sort of ranged $400 million to $600 million for a while and the business is pretty stable topline and margin. I recognize you have some opportunity to grow the business and expand margins going forward. I think the pension looks pretty net neutral. The CapEx looks pretty stable. It sounded like you said earlier that you expect in that 2024 $780 million midpoint about $200 million of working capital. And I guess, should I think of working -- change in working capital is not a sustainable recurring part of the free cash flow, and therefore, that kind of $580 million, $600 million as sort of a predictable, sustainable engine of the cash flow statement going forward or is there some other reason to think of the base business is eventually making up that $200 million?
Tom Stiehle: Yeah. So that’s a great question and we study that all the time and it’s the former -- it’s former with a caveat, right? So we are hitting the point right now. We have been impacted. If you look at the cash flow statement, we were in the $400 million to $600 million. I’d tell you from 2020, 2021 and 2022, those COVID, FICA repays and the COVID payments have tripped up and you have to normalize after that. A couple of things are happening. Obviously…
Noah Poponak: Okay.
Tom Stiehle: … prior to this window, the margin has dropped in Shipbuilding as we have kind of run through COVID. So we are fighting and working ourselves back with incremental improvement. The revenue growth with the backlog that we have shown you there and we expect at least have 3% here kind of going forward when we get through this labor crunch, that’s in place. So I think you can model that out. The -- as we go forward, the working capital I believe we will be in that 5% to 6% range and both yards are in a good rhythm right now, the DDG program annually, what we are doing with launch and sell off boat on VCS, the rhythm of Block V is behind that, the two carry by following 79, the Columbia Build 1, Build 2. So I think we are settling down on the mix of the portfolios in each yard and the timing on when they are going to pop out so. We have told you in the past, traditionally a Shipbuilding is like 6% to 8% of what we would expect. That gets water down a little bit, because now with Mission Technology and Alion with more sales in the base the numbers kind of pop down. If you normalize in just to the traditional Shipbuilding what we have talked about, right, we were at 12%, I think, in Q1 of 2022, Q3 of 2023, we are at 14%. We finished the year at 7.8% just for Shipbuilding and now as we go from 7.8% to 8.3% for Shipbuilding sales, we will see ourselves go down to 6% in 2024. That’s in the range that we were highlighting, say, for the first 10 years of the corporation of 6% to 8% in working capital. We were at that range in 2018. We were in the 6% or so. I think that’s sustainable as long as we are in a normal rhythm of adding work, which we have the backlog, we are performing to schedule, so we are selling ships off timely. And although being either at 6% our Shipbuilding sales or is subside, including all my sales with Mission Technology is on the low end of the range. I think what offsets that is the revenue -- an incremental revenue and margin that we think we are going to have in the coming years. So I am still bullish on the north of $700 million is going to be a run rate in a couple of years from now and I think 2024 is that inflection point to kind of start that run.
Noah Poponak: Okay. The north of $700 million in a few years, I guess, if 2024 is $780 million midpoint about $200 million of working capital, once you get to the working capital goal, you then cease to have positive change in working capital flow to the cash flow. So 2025 million, I mean, who knows exactly what it’s going to be, but sort of directionally would not have that. So is there a step down from 2024 as -- and then as the business grows, you over time get back to that $700 million?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. Noah, we are not going to discuss.
Noah Poponak: You are not.
Chris Kastner: We are not going to forecast 2025 free cash right now. But I think your logic is okay. The business is going to grow. And if we stay down with those working capital numbers, you are not going to get a benefit from it. You are going to have to get it from growth and margin improvement. So I think your logic is sound. But we do definitely believe that free cash is going to get north of $700 million in 2024 and then continue to grow from there.
Tom Stiehle: I will tell you stick with a lot of the numbers, right? So I walk through how we normalize out the 2021 and 2022 because of COVID that you can see we are incrementally going from that $460-ish million to $510 million to $550 million with the guide of $425 million this year, COVID-adjusted, that’s another $550 million. And then I am telling you the working capital is going to get us there in 2024. So that is just say what’s the run rate. I think you are looking at…
Noah Poponak: Okay.
Tom Stiehle: … the right way on how you model it and we will provide guidance…
Noah Poponak: Okay.
Tom Stiehle: … for 2025 a year from that.
Chris Kastner: Yeah.
Noah Poponak: Great. And then, Chris, just on labor, you spent some time on it, but -- and it’s unpredictable, but I guess maybe just how -- when do you think you could get to something close to normal on your labor churn and development of the people you are hiring in. I guess with the amount of time you spent on it, the amount of time you have been in the business, obviously, it’s an unprecedented situation, but how much more time do you need to get to something that’s pretty stable?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. Well, it’s absolutely more stable now than it was a year ago, okay? And that’s a testament to the hard work, the shipyards have put in to really kind of pivot who they were hiring, increase the training, increase the leadership training. So it’s absolutely better. I don’t know if you have ever done, right? There was a pretty generational change in our workforce where we lost a large swath of people through COVID. So we are retraining a workforce and retraining foreman and general foreman and construction superintendence and that’s happening. And the best thing we can do and the greatest learning potential is delivering ships. We are going to deliver five this year. Once you have been through that, you have learned a lot and they are going to continue to learn a lot. So I think it’s only improvement from here. I don’t think you have ever done, but I think we have made great progress.
Noah Poponak: Okay. Thanks for the time.
Chris Kastner: Yeah. Thanks, Noah.
Tom Stiehle: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Kastner for any closing remarks.
Chris Kastner: Thank you for joining today. I am proud of all the hard work put in by the team and I am confident the hard work we are doing will pay off and value creation for all our stakeholders moving forward. Thanks again for joining the call.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 HII Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Christie Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mrs. Thomas, you may begin.
Christie Thomas: Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the HII third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Chris Kastner, our President and CEO; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, any forward-looking statements made today that are not historical facts are considered our company's estimates or expectations and are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law.

For reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast which are available on the Investor Relations website at ir.hii.com. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris Kastner. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Christy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call. I would like to begin today by highlighting the HII teams that work hard day in and day out to support our national defense customers, craftsmen and women constructing and overhauling the most powerful and survivable naval ships ever built, engineers and technology specialists developing critical capabilities and mission-driven solutions, all aligned with supporting our customers' priorities and pressing national defense needs. Thank you to the entire HII team. Now, let's turn to our results on Page 3 of the presentation. In the third quarter, we had sales of $2.6 billion which were 12% higher than 2021 and diluted EPS was $3.44 for the quarter, down from $3.65 in 2021. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $2.1 billion which results in backlog of approximately $46.7 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $23.2 billion is currently funded. We continue to make progress across all of our shipbuilding programs. At Ingalls, we recently completed acceptance trials on DDG 123 Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee. And during the third quarter, the keel was authenticated for DDG 129 Jeremiah Denton. In our amphibious ship product lines, fabrication began on LPD 31 Pittsburgh. And last week, we were awarded a $2.4 billion detail design and construction contract for LHA 9. Also, we have commenced the work to complete the combat system, installation and activation on the Zumwalt-class destroyer, Lyndon B. Johnson, DDG 1002. At Newport News, CVN 79 Kennedy is moving further into the test program and began testing of the electromagnetic launch system. And on the other side of the shipyard, the keel was laid in the drydock for CVN 80 enterprise. The RCOH program continues to make progress with CVN 73 USS George Washington, on track to redeliver next year. Also, we continue to see progress on the Virginia-class submarine program and expect to deliver SSN 796 New Jersey -- SSN 798 Massachusetts next year. In the quarter, we experienced continued challenges from the broader macroeconomic environment, most notably a persistent tight labor market with really no material improvement in general economic conditions. Through the third quarter, we have hired over 3,600 craftsmen and women against our full year plan of approximately 5,000. And we continue to utilize the levers of outside leased labor and over time to offset the short-term deficit of employees. In addition, supply chain challenges continue across our supplier ecosystem, resulting in longer material lead times and inflation pressure. As we've discussed previously on inflation, we do have some contractual mitigation and we continue to actively manage the supply chain and our production schedules to minimize impacts. To address our shipbuilding labor challenges, we have aggressively enhanced our skilled workforce development pipeline. To this end, while we broadened our recruiting efforts to bring in more shipbuilders, we are also expanding our very successful apprenticeship programs, including revised curricula, reduction in completion time lines, a focus on pre-apprenticeships and use apprenticeships and expansion to underserved populations and women in the industry. Moving to our Mission Technologies business. Our pipeline remains very strong with $4 billion in proposal or evaluation and $17 billion in capture. Our third quarter book-to-bill was 2.2 and was a healthy 1.1 year-to-date. Integration of operations and business systems following the Alion acquisition is largely complete. And we are already seeing strong synergies such as the recently announced DMATs and awards totaling over $900 million in total contract value. We also received a couple of major contract actions in our Nuclear and Environmental business that were driven by sustained strong performance. At Savannah River, our joint venture received an extension for 4 years, plus an additional option year and at the Nevada National Security site, our joint venture received a simultaneous early exercise of all 5 of its option years. These are significant wins and we are very proud to support DOE across the complex. Despite headwinds earlier in the year due to the delayed omnibus spending bill and the ongoing intense competition for talent, we continue to gain momentum and see strong growth potential going forward. This includes both domestic and international markets, where we are expanding our presence in regions consistent with the national security strategy. In summary, I am confident that our presence across all the combatant commands coupled with an increasing demand signal for advanced technology solutions from our DoD customers positions mission technology as well going into FY '23. Shifting to activities in Washington; the federal government began the new fiscal year under a continuing resolution which funds government operations through December. We continue to urge to proceed expeditiously and remain optimistic that the annual defense appropriations and authorization processes will be completed in the months ahead. While final outcomes will depend on eventual respective appropriations and authorization conference committee negotiations, we are pleased to see defense oversight committees provide strong support to shipbuilding to include recommendations for new DDG 51 multiyear procurement authority, additional funding for amphibious ships and requirements for not less than 31 amphibious warfare ships. The strong shipbuilding demand driven by our national defense requirements as shown on Slide 5. These critical customer needs spanning destroyers, amphibs [ph], submarines and aircraft carriers and including new construction, overhaul and maintenance and modernization will result in significant contract award opportunities driving continued backlog stability. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financials. Tom?
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris and good morning. Today, I'll briefly review our third quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 6. Our third quarter revenues of $2.6 billion increased approximately 12% compared to the same period last year. This increased revenue was attributable to the acquisition of Alion in the third quarter of 2021 as well as growth at Newport News Shipbuilding. Operating income for the quarter of $131 million increased by $13 million or 11% from the third quarter of 2021 and operating margin of 5% was essentially flat from the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to more favorable noncurrent state income taxes and operating fast cash adjustment compared to the prior year period as well as improved results at Newport News Shipbuilding. Other net expense was $13 million in the quarter which was primarily driven by losses on equity investments given market volatility in the quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 14.8% compared to negative 4.3% in the third quarter of last year which included research and development tax credits for tax years 2016 through 2020. Net earnings in the quarter were $138 million compared to $147 million in the third quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $3.44 compared to $3.65 in the third quarter of the previous year. Moving on to Slide 7. Ingall's revenues of $623 million in the quarter decreased to $5 million or less than 1% from the same period last year. driven primarily by lower revenues on the NSE and LPD programs and partially offset by higher DDG program revenues. Ingall's operating income of $50 million and margin at 8% in the quarter declined from last year, primarily due to lower risk retirement on the DDG program, partially offset by higher LPD risk retirement. At Newport News, revenues of $1.4 billion increased by $91 million or a robust 6.7% on from the same period last year due to higher naval nuclear support services as well as submarine and aircraft carrier revenues compared to the previous year. Newport News operating income of $102 million and margin of 7.1% were up from the last year due to contract incentives on the Columbia class submarine program, partially offset by lower risk retirement on the VCS program. The Columbia class contract incentives are related to Newport News support of continued growth in the submarine construction enterprise. At Mission Technologies, revenues of $595 million, increased $201 million compared to the third quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the acquisition of Alion in the third quarter of last year. Mission Technologies' operating income of $14 million compared to operating income of $13 million in the third quarter of last year. Current results included approximately $24 million of amortization of Alion-related purchase intangible assets compared to $8 million in the third quarter of last year. Mission Technologies' EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 8.4% and 8.7% year-to-date. Turning to Slide 8. Cash used by operations was $19 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $77 million or 2.9% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of negative $96 million. This compares to cash from operations of $350 million, net capital expenditures of $73 million or 3.1% of revenues and free cash flow of $277 million in the third quarter of 2021. While third quarter free cash flow was below the projection we provided on our last earnings call, this is simply a function of timing as well as a tax payment of approximately $80 million that we elected to make in the third quarter given the lower probability of delayed deferral of changes to the R&D tax treatment. In fact, we are increasing our overall free cash flow outlook for fiscal year 2022 which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $11 million in the quarter, of which less than $1 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plan. During the third quarter, we paid dividends of $1.18 per share or $48 million. We also repurchased approximately 66,000 shares during the quarter at an aggregate cost of approximately $14 million. Moving on to Slide 9 and our updated outlook for the 2022 and 2023 pension and postretirement benefits. First, I would like to highlight that our funded status remains strong and has improved year-to-date. Additionally, I will note that the cash flow impacts related to the pension changes remain muted. For 2023, the FAS benefit has come down considerably from our last update, given the more immediate recognition of the negative asset returns experienced thus far in 2022. While the increase in the discount rate does partially offset the impact of asset returns, the magnitude of the impact related to lower asset returns is clearly more significant. Please remember that pension-related numbers are subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria. We will provide a multiyear update of pension estimates on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. Turning to Slide 10. We are narrowing our 2022 Shipbuilding and Mission Technologies revenue guidance to the lower end of our prior guidance ranges, given results through the third quarter and the current operating environment. We are now expecting shipbuilding revenue to be between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion and expect Mission Technologies revenues to be approximately $2.4 billion. The narrowing of the shipbuilding revenue guidance is a function of the challenging labor environment that we have frequently discussed as well as our expectations for the timing of the material as we near year-end. The Mission Technologies revenue is a reflection of the slower start of the year as well as the current hiring environment. As Chris noted, third quarter book-to-bill ratio exceeded 2.0, a very positive indicator as we move forward and we remain very enthusiastic about the growth opportunities at Mission Technologies. We are reaffirming our shipbuilding operating margin guidance range of 8% to 8.1%. For Mission Technologies, we are slightly revising our margin guidance to approximately 2.3% which is largely a function of the lower volume of work in the year. Moving to free cash flow. We are increasing our guidance for 2022 [ph]. Under current Section 174 R&D tax law, the midpoint of our prior guidance was $225 million which has now been raised to approximately $350 million. The most significant driver of that increase is the COVID progress repayment which we initially expected in 2022, moving to 2023. Given our free cash flow through the third quarter, we are expecting very strong free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter. On Slide 11, we have provided an updated in view of our free cash flow expectations. This outlook assumes the current R&D amortization treatment for tax purposes remain in place. And given that adjustment, our 2020 through 2024 free cash flow expectation is now approximately $2.9 billion. As we have noted before, the impact of the R&D treatment is approximately $250 million over the 2022 through 2024 time frame. We are reaffirming our capital allocation priorities, including our commitment to return substantially all free cash flow after planned debt repayment to shareholders through 2024. As we have noted, this is a significant commitment which should result in increased share repurchases, particularly in 2024 after we have reached a designed debt level. I will also note that we have recently announced and increased our quarterly cash dividend to $1.24, a 5% increase over the prior amount. To summarize, the operating environment remains challenging and we were not able to overcome the slow start to the services contracting pace which has resulted in revenue guidance moving to the low end of our prior ranges. We are pleased to reaffirm our shipbuilding margin guidance and increase our free cash flow expectations as we aggressively manage through current business conditions. Regarding fiscal year 2023, we plan to provide detailed guidance on our fourth quarter call, consistent with our normal guidance. With that said, we continue to view a long-term shipbuilding revenue CAGR of 3% as appropriate and we are pleased to reaffirm our long-term free cash flow target through 2024, as I have discussed. We would normally expect incremental shipbuilding operating margin improvement in 2023. However, given the current economic environment, we will need to close out the year to assess risk retirement and operational efficiencies before we can provide more insight. We will finish the year just as we've started focused on execution and we'll provide a more comprehensive update on our view for 2023 in February. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris for some final remarks before we take your questions.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Tom. Before wrapping up, I would like to highlight on Slide 12 that we will release an updated HII's sustainability report in the coming days which will be available on our website. We are focused on the alignment of the program with our mission, values and purpose and structuring our strategy around securing our business, building our community and protecting our resources. We have enhancements in process for future sustainability reporting and expect another update to be released in the spring of 2023. Finally, turning to Slide 13. We remain focused on successfully executing on our strong backlog and positioning for long-term growth which will generate value for our employees, customers and shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to Christie for Q&A.
Christie Thomas: [Operator Instructions] Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Doug Harned: On Newport News, can you give us a sense of how things are progressing on Virginia class? I mean that's been -- I know you had less risk retirement this time around but we've talked a lot about this and the importance of getting labor back and trained. Where does that stand now in terms of your outlook?
Chris Kastner: Yes. Thanks for that, Doug. Some -- definitely some stability in the Virginia class program right now, the Block 14 and 796 which is the [indiscernible] to be delivered, some positive developments from a schedule standpoint. They are very, very stable and looking towards the beginning of next year to get that [indiscernible] delivered. So I'd say stability in the schedule. Still working very hard on the fundamentals of cost and efficiency. But I think we're in a pretty good place from a schedule standpoint there.
Doug Harned: Well, yes, so in terms of cost and efficiency, I guess what I'm trying to get at is -- is this there is a -- if you're seeing kind of a clear path to a point where you're really happy that you've got everything under control in terms of costs and so forth? I mean I'm just trying to get a picture for what that trajectory looks like to you now over the next few quarters, say?
Chris Kastner: Yes. Sure. So fundamentally, when you have stability in your schedules and stability in your planning documentation and you know what work is in front of you, then you're going to have a better chance to have an efficient performance from a cost standpoint. So first things first, let's get the schedule right. We've got the labor. They are fully staffed on Block IV and Block 5 and they're making progress on their milestones. And now it's just knocking down that work, getting to the test program on 796 and progressing on 798. So I'm not going to give you a trajectory on margins on the VCS program. I will say, the best indicator within the submarine program is, are you making your milestones? Are your schedule stable? And if they are, you're going to meet your cost you're going to meet your cost objectives. But there's a lot of fight in that team, they're working very hard to get that done. I know the team is working very hard on the fundamentals of the operating system. If they get that right, they work on that every single week which they are, they're going to be successful.
Doug Harned: If I can squeeze just one more in here. related to cost. You mentioned inflation in the last quarter. Historically, I felt your view has been that you can handle inflation. You've got enough opportunities in terms of escalators and so forth to deal with that. But when you talk about what may be different this time because we're seeing in a lot of defense companies now that inflation in the short term is more difficult than we've seen in prior periods.
Chris Kastner: Yes. Well, so as I said previously, we do have some protection. The biggest issue for inflation for us is going to be in our -- really on our new contracts and ensuring that we get the bids right from the supply chain and ensure that the cost and schedule is correct when we bid those new contracts. So that's probably the greatest risk for us. We do have some inflation issues within some of our piece parts in the supply chain where we didn't have those under contract. But as I said previously, we have some protection for that, although not fully protected. So the real issue for us related to inflation is getting the bids right on our new contracts and we're working very hard to ensure we do that.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.
Robert Spingarn: Tom, what was the organic growth for Mission Technologies in the third quarter since you have a partial inclusion last year in the third quarter? And then I know Alion has a lot of cost-plus work but how much might wage inflation have contributed to the top line growth there?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So when I look at that, you are right. We closed August 19 of last year. So the third quarter last year was incomplete. So the organic growth for the quarter specifically was about 1.5%. But I look at it for the year, it could be choppy because of the [indiscernible] at the beginning of the year. We've talked about the slow contracting environment, the wins and then the supply chain issue a little bit on the operational side of that. The overall emission technologies growth for the year is 4.3%. Alion stuff grew 8%. Q2, we told you about 6% Mission Technologies as a whole. Mission Technologies, revenue top line is a little light. Usually that third quarter for us or the fourth fiscal quarter is a sweep up quarter for both line and legacy MDIS we had anticipated when we told you about an 8% growth against the Q2 top line, we would see about that didn't materialize there. As I said, factors were that we didn't sweep up as much as we thought were in funds and have open seats we've talked about and hiring professionals there and then just some material -- some material didn't hit in the quarter. So that's where we stand with growth.
Chris Kastner: Sorry, Rob, I don't recall if you just said that, Tom but I think that we had pro forma growth of 8% year-to-date within Mission Technologies. So I'm feeling very positive about the business. We had 2 real good wins in DMATs and Air Force training contract which is very positive. The book-to-bill is positive. So I think that team has a lot of opportunity moving into '23.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then just a high level one, Chris. But on this potential 5-unit block buy for the Columbia class, could you talk about what that might mean for Huntington Ingalls as a cost savings and labor continuity opportunity?
Chris Kastner: Well, we assume that the Columbia class will kind of orderly based on the planning documentations we've received from the Navy and Electric Boat, that that's been included in all our capacity planning and how we think about the business going forward [indiscernible] growth rate. Now I think the Navy has been very thoughtful in how they order material and how they're thinking about bundling procurement to ensure they get the best economics relative to ordering material from the supply chain. So I think it's a smart way to do it. We're just in the initial stages of kind of talking about it. But it will definitely be involved a part of our growth rate going forward. It's -- it will be a source of growth in Newport News and I think the team is smartly working on it.
Robert Spingarn: Is it fair to think that's better visibility than normal, 5 boats?
Chris Kastner: Absolutely. But you think -- jeez, as think about defense strategy and you think about the CNO NAV plan and the amount of visibility we have right now into what our backlog will be and the demand signal we're going to get in shipbuilding, we have very good visibility and high confidence that we're going to be in a pretty good place over the next 10 to 15 years from a visibility standpoint. The important thing we need to do is focus on execution, make sure we get these bids correct and then get the ships delivered because the Navy needs them.
Tom Stiehle: I'd comment, too, on the back end of that. We added a new slide to kind of hit the strong demand for shipbuilding. You can see a backlog chart on Slide 5 there which shows that backlog at the $46 billion range that sustained itself through at least 2026. We have excellent visibility from both the shipbuilding [ph] plan, the 5-year side plan and then the more immediate FY '23 budget of expectations what we see in the near term and we have tremendous visibility of the awards we expect to come in the next 3 to 5 years.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Credit Suisse.
Unidentified Analyst: Tom, can you quantify the benefit of the Columbia class incentives? And just wondering if that's something that could help also help the business in the coming quarters or maybe that's a one-off?
Tom Stiehle: Yes, sure. So you'll see that in the Q later this morning when it comes out. The quantification is $41 million of Columbia incentives. And over the last 2 or 3 calls, we've highlighted that as we're working closely with our customer or customer and how the Virginia class and the Columbia class play out, both the additional boats to Block V, the Block VI boats and then we're working closely to program offices as far as what those requirements look like, what are the schedule requirements the both have to fly out here and that drives capacity and capability requirements within Newport News. So we've worked closely with the program office there and we see a need for additional capacity that we have in the yard. We've negotiated a position right now and we've achieved those incentives in the quarter. So it's $41 million.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then Chris, apparently, the Ukrainians recently used unmanned service vessels and combat, I think last Saturday. I think there were these USVs [ph]. If I recall correctly, you've said in the past that the -- it was something that still needed some work on the unmanned service vessels. So I guess now that you've actually -- we've actually seen these in combat, do you think that's a big moment for a class of weapon systems broadly? And what does that mean for Huntington?
Chris Kastner: Yes, Scott. I don't want to comment on the specific mission. But I think getting these assets in the water executing missions for the customer is very important because it's going to demonstrate how positive and productive these can be as a force multiplier. And we think it's the most positive thing we can do is get these in service so they can demonstrate their pretty impressive capability. Now I don't know if we've hit an inflection point from a revenue standpoint as of yet but there's definitely momentum that's being gained both Subsea and on the surface and a number of different con ops and missions that are being contemplated for these type of vessels. So we only think it's a positive development and we think it will continue to gain momentum and we really like where we're positioned.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Tom, could you just go through the rundown in the quarter?
Tom Stiehle: Cumulative adjustments that we had then. So it was $84 million [ph] favorable, $57 million [ph] unfavorable, a net of $27 million and a proportionate of that was about half of that was on Newport News and then 25% each for Ingalls [ph].
David Strauss: Great. And then as we think about the opportunity for improved shipbuilding margins next year, I mean, you obviously talked about that there potentially could be some leverage on the volume side. But -- what about, Chris, I guess, from a milestone perspective, how do you see the milestones in '23 relative to '22 giving you an opportunity for -- to enhance margins?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So we'll give you a comprehensive update on the milestones on the next call. But the 5 deliveries in '23, we're still very positive on those schedules are holding and we're pacing towards delivery on those ships. And the balance of those milestones are in process and on schedule as well as that we previously indicated to you. So yes, there's some opportunity but we're going to assess the risk and opportunity every quarter. It's definitely still a tight labor market. There's been some positive indicators here as of late but I don't think 2 data points is necessarily a trend. So we're going to be measured in how we deal with that, assess our risks and opportunities and then provide you a comprehensive update at the end of the year. But the milestones in '23 are holding. We're very comfortable with that we need to get these assets delivered and the team is working very hard to do that.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes, I just wanted to pursue, you raised the long-term assets for the pension to 8%. I guess that's maybe just based on how bad it is this year but if you give some color on it? And then also, what -- how that effect is your -- not the contribution, how it affected your adjustments for next year?
Tom Stiehle: Yes, sure, George. I appreciate the question. Yes. So we did raise that. When we look at the company as a whole in business now 11 full years, this 12th. 9 of the 11 we exceeded the target of 7.5% that we've had. Obviously, this is a down year 2 years we were less than in the quarter. And as we've highlighted to the Street where as our peers are too, we're in the double-digit negative returns against the pension plan that we have here. So we do think it's prudent when we looked at it going forward, that at least for next year, we have an expectation that the return on assets could be 8%. So we raised that [ph]. Relative to the pension, you can see from our table that we gave you that updated the parameters 2023 is that rate has changed, it's gone from 3% to 4.90% [ph]. So that's up 190 bps. We gave you the returns on what we saw through the year-to-date at minus 15%. And you can see that flows through the fast cash adjustment was down about $102 million. So that's some headwinds on EPS next year. But we'll keep you updated and at the next call, we give you the entire [indiscernible] a 5-year projection going forward.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: I'd actually just say that -- I was going to ask a question about the asset returns and I figured no one else would ask that question but if someone did, I knew it would be, George. Maybe thinking about a different kind of bigger picture question and I apologize if this is a little bit squishy. But I was looking for something on your website recently and you go on the site and I think initially, there's a picture of like a solider, like an Army soldier holding gun and you've got kind of see cyber, land air, join all domain. When you think long term, Chris, about how you want to position the company during your tenure? Is there a point -- I know it's far out there by 2030 or whatever, where you want to see shipbuilding be a certain percentage of sales and much lower than it is right now?
Chris Kastner: Well, it's going to be [indiscernible] percentage simply because we think we've made really good investments in growth markets when you think about the technology markets that we're in Mission Technologies. They really directly relate to the national priorities when you think about AI, ML, cyber, unmanned, ISR, live virtual constructive training and advanced synthetic training. Those directly relate and apply to the defense priorities moving forward. So they will naturally grow. And so shipbuilding will be less of a percentage of the portfolio. But make no mistake, shipbuilding will always kind of be at the heart of this company and we're focused on it. But I think they'll naturally reposition a little bit based on the technology. And it's interesting the Navy is asking for this, right? These are the Navy priorities. And I can think of no better way to serve your customers than to answer their call relative to additional more complicated missions that they need to execute. So -- it's a good question. It's one we think about a lot. And we think we're making the appropriate investments in these technology areas.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.
Gautam Khanna: Wanted to ask, just to be clear, the labor shortfall this year, how does that impact the timing of any milestones in the next couple of years? Is everything -- or the 8 milestones you cited last quarter for '23 still on for '23. Is there any Q4 weight to those, etcetera?
Chris Kastner: They're still on for '23. And we assess the labor situation and Gautam, thanks for the question, this is Chris. And we assess our labor plans and our program schedules on a quarterly basis. So all of the labor situation that we've seen this year, what we expect for next year is always included in those program schedules and we're still comfortable with those milestones.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. Could you -- so what do you anticipate your labor hires to be this year relative to the 5,000? And then what is the impact on an annual basis from the delta between 5,000 and whatever it's likely to be?
Chris Kastner: Well, we're on pace to get to 5,000. I'm still comfortable with that number. We're going to have to see how it goes. We've had a couple of good indicators here. So we're still comfortable with that. As we said previously on this call, we'll give you a better highlight on what we think about '23 in February.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And do you have a preliminary view on what you need to add next year in terms of...
Chris Kastner: Not at this time. We're working on that now. We're coming through our plans. -- and we'll provide you that information in February, Gautam.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Myles [ph] with Wolfe Research.
Unidentified Analyst: On the topic of milestones, I was hoping you could touch on the 2 that were still on the slate for '22, DDG-123 and then [indiscernible].
Chris Kastner: Sure. So 123 is on schedule has some really good trials. They're on pace to get delivered before the end of the year. And then -- it [ph] has been initiated. I was actually down in the spaces last month, maybe 2 months ago. All the equipment is installed, doing localized testing, starting that test program. So some positive developments there. So yes, each of those are on schedule.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, got it. I was just going off the -- I think the release talked about a few, if any, milestones in the fourth quarter. So those must be minor milestone releases or reserve releases?
Chris Kastner: Well, we'll assess them when they're complete and review the entire risk and opportunities and then deal with the outcomes at each.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, all right. And then maybe, Tom, on the progress payment rule or Chris, is there any legislative indication that, that rule is going to be reversed at some point? Because I mean, I know it's favorable but I'm imagining you're flowing it to your suppliers as well. I'm just curious, are you anticipating a rule change? Or are you actually seeing legislative action or policy action that would suggest it's going to change next year?
Tom Stiehle: We think there's interest -- it's Tom. Yes, thanks for the question. We think there's interest there up on the hill. I don't think it's a top priority right now. We'll have to see how it plays out. We get through the elections. Does it get inserted into a bill by year-end or not? As the year progresses and there's just one last -- may kind of mid-December time frame, the benefit this year doesn't play out. But obviously, as soon as that loss swings over, as we've been highlighting, it's a $250 million impact, a positive impact to the free cash flow. So we're eagerly awaiting that. I'm hopeful that it does could change but we'll just have to see how that plays out.
Unidentified Analyst: Sorry, Tom, I was referring to the progress payment rule shifts that you thought it would be reversed in '22. Now it's going to be reversed in '23. Just the timing of progress statements. I'm asking, do you actually see legislative inertia there.
Tom Stiehle: So I would tell you that, as I told you at the Q3 call that believe it was going to be pushed to the end of the year right now and that's a piece of the uptick that we have in our free cash flow guidance that we gave you. So we told you it was 2.25 [ph] was the midpoint. We now project to have to pay those payments back in 2023 time frame. So it's an uptick in -- for this year, it's an adjustment in the free cash flow bridge that we gave you in the briefing and we anticipate paying those back in the first quarter of '23.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: Yes, looking at Mission Tech, do you still feel confident on that 6% to 8% margin target by '24?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So we're on cost right now. When we look at the EBITDA right now, we've given you the numbers on where we finished the previous year and 8% range. If you noticed, we just adjusted the EBITDA NDA target down from 8.5% to 8.3% because of the volume pressures that we have but we feel comfortable with that right now. As the -- in the rising we have, we still have a robust pipeline. We feel comfortable that we're getting our momentum. The portfolio itself and the technology that we're going after many opportunities at this. So I do. I think there's a little stress on it right now for 2022 just for the volume of sales as we adjust around that. But that's still a target that we've been highlighting and it's good for modeling going forward.
Chris Kastner: Yes. Ron, remember, a lot of that work is cost-plus. There's a lot of we think there'll be a lot of stability in the margin rate moving forward. So we're still comfortable with that.
Ron Epstein: Got it. And then, if you look at Newport News and you back out the Columbia, right, the $41 million, that suggests the balance of the business was at maybe 4% margin in the quarter. Can you kind of walk through what was going on there?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So we had minor adjustments or what I'll call tweaks in -- within the quarter on a few programs at Newport News, not material enough to be mentioned here and that it was offset by the Columbia class incentives. Now incentives and schedule incentives, performance incentives are normal in our contracts, it's a normal way to incentivize performance. We think it's a good method to incentivize performance. So it's not out of the ordinary. But we have to assess our EACs every quarter, we make minor adjustments where we see fit to the risk and opportunities and there was just some minor adjustments on a few of the programs there.
Ron Epstein: Can you give any more color on like what programs?
Chris Kastner: Yes, not material enough to mention, it was across a number of them.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Why did you choose to exclude the milestone slide from the deck this quarter?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So we only do that twice a year. We kind of inserted that as a convention. So we've done it twice a year. I can comment on any one of them that you'd like. As I said previously to some of the questions, the last 2 for this year are on schedule, deliveries for next year are on schedule. So it's just been our convention twice a year if you go back in time.
Noah Poponak: Okay. I had forgotten that. So yes, I wasn't sure if it was, hey, something's happening with the milestones or it's -- nothing's changed, so it doesn't need to be there. And I just had forgotten that it was choice here. So...
Chris Kastner: It's something that's happening with the milestones, I'd tell you. So -- but they're on schedule. So thanks for that. It's just -- that's our convention.
Noah Poponak: Got it. Okay, perfect. With your discussion of inflation, I mean, I guess at the highest level of addressing it, do you expect inflation to actually negatively impact the margin in any noticeable way in the medium term? Or do you feel you have the contracting conventions to offset it?
Chris Kastner: Yes, it could. I'll start and then Tom can chip in here. So we do have some protections, right, from an inflation standpoint. We were very fortunate that with our relationship with the labor unions, we're able to get long-term arrangements there which helps us mitigate it to some extent. Having suppliers under contract before we entered into this mitigates it to some extent. And then our EPA clauses mitigates it some. But absolutely, when you think about our workforce and some of the increases that we've had to provide from a salary standpoint for new hires, that impacts our labor rates a bit. And then some of the general inventory that you can't put under contract could impact it a bit as well. So I would say it modestly impacts it. We've assessed all of it in our EAC process and we think we have it but we're going to have to be mindful of it moving forward.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And then, I guess your commentary about next year's shipbuilding margin, do we need to consider the potential that it is down year-over-year? Or were you more just saying the plan was some expansion that's still possible but flattish is also possible.
Tom Stiehle: I think it's more of the latter there. Obviously, we want to come through. We're watching a risk profile, the risk registers what gets burned down this quarter, the performance and the cadence. We're maintaining schedule, the hiring and the experience in the yard, progress that we make with the experience and the material [indiscernible]. A piece of that process is the contract adjustments we get, the EPA and other type of provisions that will handle for inflation. To piggyback on what Chris said earlier, depending on the portfolio and the mix, Ingalls is more 90-10 fixed price, Newport News is 50-50 cost type and fixed which contracts have EPA clauses which contracts are being impacted. So a lot of things are moving around there between inflation, supply chain, interest rates, performance, material receipt and progressing. So, we really want to get a look see on where we stand right now. We told you 8% to 8.1% and we still feel comfortable with that right now. We had a strong first half which we kind of foreshadowed -- we told you the back half would be about 7% for shipbuilding. We came in at 7.4% with those incentives. So you can do the math. We're still holding at 7% for the back half of the year. So you can do the math on that, what Q4 looks like. But I think 8% to 8.1% is still a valid endpoint for us. I'd like to see where we land on that, see our run rate and then we'll factor that into the baseline going forward on the February call.
Operator: We now have a follow-up question from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Just want to -- Tom, maybe if you could run through the expectations on net working capital now. I think you had said -- I think right now, we're at about 11%. I think you would say getting down to 8% at the end of this year and then relatively flat on a percentage of sales basis from there but coming down in absolute terms, if you could just give an update.
Tom Stiehle: Sure. Yes. So for -- yes, that's exactly right. I left her at 9.3% -- about 9.3% was the working capital sales in Q2. We are just about 11%, 11.1% for Q3. I anticipated that. We'll turn the corner a little bit as we exit the year here as we kind of work ourselves through the trades, the invoicing, payments and progressing. That will come down. And then we've talked about the milestones with the 5 deliveries of next year which are still in play here. So I see '23 dropping back to more traditional 6% to 8% range. And I would expect that we would run in that rate over the next couple of years. And that's the plan and we're on that trajectory.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now pass the line back to the management team, Chris Kastner, for final remarks.
Chris Kastner: Thanks a lot. Thanks very much for your interest in -- continued interest in HII. We welcome your continued engagement and feedback. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-04 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Second Quarter 2022 HII Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakersâ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the call over to Christie Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mrs. Thomas, you may begin.
Christie Thomas: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industriesâ second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With us today are Chris Kastner, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in their remarks today, Chris and Tom will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at hii.com and click on the Investors link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris Kastner. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks Christie. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on today's call. Before discussing the results, I would like to thank each of our 44,000 employees for the work they do every day as they remain focused on our operational pillars of safety, quality, cost, and schedule and driving the delivery of our customer commitments. Today, we reported another quarter of solid performance across each of our operating segments. These results reflect our continued focus on operational execution. Starting with our results on Page 3 of the presentation, sales of $2.7 billion for the quarter or 19.3% higher than 2021. And diluted EPS was $4.44 for the quarter, up from $3.20 in 2021. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $2 billion, which results in backlog of approximately $47 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $24.6 billion is currently funded. At Ingalls this quarter, LPD 29, Richard M. McCool Jr. was christened and serial production continued on LPD 30 Harrisburg and LPD 31 Pittsburgh. We were also awarded the advanced procurement contract for LPD 32. Additionally, progress continues on LHA 8 Bougainville and long-lead material procurement continues for LHA 9, with the detailed design and construction contract award expected later this year. On the DDG program, DDG 121 Frank E. Petersen Jr. sail away this quarter and serial production continues on DDG 123 and subsequent DDGs. On the NSC program we launched and christened NSC 10 Calhoun this quarter. At Newport News, submarine care and carrier construction and maintenance programs continued to progress. On the VCS program as discussed in the first quarter call, SSN 796, New Jersey floated off in April. In addition, SSN 798, Massachusetts achieved pressure hole complete in the quarter and the remaining Block 4 and Block 5 boats continue to make progress. On CVN 79 Kennedy, we turned over the 1000th compartment to the Navy last month and we will ramp the testing program later this year. CVN 80 Enterprise is beginning to take shape in the drydock and early unit construction has begun on CVN 81 Doris Miller. On the RCOH program CVN 73, USS George Washington continues to make progress on the testing phase and redelivery is now expected in the first quarter of 2023. CVN 74, USS John C. Stennis continues to make progress and pre-advanced planning is underway on CVN 75, USS Harry S. Truman. Regarding our shipbuilding labor, ensuring our shipyards have the necessary workforce to execute our backlog remains a key risk and focus area. We have hired over 2,000 craftsmen and women through the first half of the year against our full year plan of 5,000. While hiring is behind plan, we are making up this deficit using outside lease labor and overtime. Even in this current tight labor environment, we have continued to successfully bring shipbuilders on board and utilize our training programs and apprentice schools, which has positioned us to execute on our commitments. Now I want to take a moment to discuss the improvements to our execution operating system in the shipyards, our operating systems utilizes the best practice at each shipyard and allows our leaders and craftsmen across all programs to speak the same language, be predictable and relentlessly focused on execution. For example, the operating system breaks a long shipbuilding construction schedule into phases, the varying duration, but are generally 10 to 12 weeks and allows focus on the commitments and the critical path items to be accomplished in that phase. It also includes a common set of metrics and processes that provide feedback on progress and performance. I expect continued improvement of our operating system to drive our shipbuilding margin expansion opportunities and to take advantage of our significant backlog. The operating system also provides transparency to our customer, a progress towards delivery of these important assets. Moving to our mission technologies segment, we successfully demonstrated the prototype platform, the Pharos system, which has capabilities for launching, operating with and retrieving unmanned underwater vehicles from an amphibious ship. This achievement, which leveraged expertise across HII segments, reflects our commitment to delivering advanced technologies and multi-domain capability to support our national security customers. We also were awarded the Mobility Air Forces Distributed Mission Operations prime contract. This award is a key win in our strategy to expand our live virtual constructive customer base beyond the Navy to the air force and other services. Turning to Slide 5, we have provided a snapshot of the mission technologies pipeline. Among recent contract awards, we were just awarded a task order, decisive mission actions and technology services or DMATS to integrate new technology and capabilities and identify and characterize threats in support of the Department of Defense for the purpose of countering and deterring current and emerging global threats. This contract has a total ceiling value of over $800 million. And this win is particularly important for further validating our investment thesis, which is bringing together the innovation and technical expertise of legacy alliance with the depth and infrastructure breadth of HII. This will create opportunity and value for our customers, shareholders and employees, more than either company could have achieved on its own. While these strategic synergy wins are very positive. We continue to see contract award delays, pressuring timing of current year revenues. However, we continue to have a very large pipeline that creates significant opportunity for bookings and sales growth. In that regard, heading into the third quarter, our mission technologies pipeline stands at $61 billion with $26 billion of qualified pipeline. The DMATS award another expected award will drive up our book-to-bill ratio, which was 0.8 for the second quarter. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with the direction of mission technologies segment. And I'm excited about the growth opportunities in areas that support our customersâ critical needs. Turning to activities in Washington. The President submitted his fiscal year 2023 budget request in March, which is now under consideration by Congress. As bill progressed through both chambers, we continue to see bipartisan support for our programs reflected into defense appropriations and authorization bills in the House and the Senate. We are very pleased to see the strong support of our ship building programs in the draft Senate appropriations bill released last week. This bill includes an additional Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, $250 million for LPD 33 advanced procurement and $289 million for LHA-10. And continues the serial production of submarines, destroyers and amphibious warships that leverages production lines and supply chains to efficiently produce the ships our nation requires. The two authorization committees have also shown strong support for ship building to include adding LPD 33 advanced procurement funding authority and requiring 31 amphibious warfare ships in the Naval combat force. Both appropriations bills and both authorization bills include language in support of a DDG-51 multi-year procurement contract in FY 2023 and provide additional support and funding for the submarine industrial base. We are pleased with the legislative support our programs have received thus far and final outcomes will depend on eventual respective conference negotiations between the appropriations and authorization committees. And now I will turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financial results. Tom?
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our second quarter results. For more detail on the segment results please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 6 of the presentation, our second quarter revenues of $2.7 billion increased approximately 19% compared to the same period last year. This increased revenue was attributable to the acquisition of Alion in the third quarter of 2021, as well as the growth in aircraft carrier revenue in Newport News Shipbuilding. Operating income for the quarter of $191 million increased by $63 million or 49% from the second quarter of 2021. And operating margin of 7.2% increased 144 basis points. These increases were largely due to a higher segment operating income driven by higher risk retirement and favorable changes in contract estimates, both at Ingalls and Newport News Shipbuilding. As well as a higher non-recurring equity income at Mission Technologies related to our investment in a ship repair and specialty fabrication joint venture. Results were additionally supported by more favorable non-current state income taxes and operating FAS/CAS adjustment compared to the prior period. Other net expense was $10 million in the quarter, which was primarily driven by losses on investments in marketable securities, given negative asset returns in the quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 19.8% compared to 19.9% in the second quarter of last year. Net earnings in the quarter were $178 million compared to $129 million in the second quarter of 2021, diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $4.44 compared to $3.20 in the second quarter of the previous year. Moving onto Slide 7, Ingalls revenues of $658 million in the quarter decreased $12 million or 1.8% from the same period last year, driven primarily by lower revenues on the DDG program, partially offset by high amphibious ship revenues. Ingalls operating income of $106 million and margin of 16.1% in the quarter were up significantly from last year due to favorable changes in contract estimates as well as higher risk retirement on the LPD program, partially offset by lower DDG risk retirement. At Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion increased by $70 million or 5.1% from the same period last year due to higher aircraft carrier revenues, partially offset by lower naval nuclear support services. Newport News operating income of $94 million and margin of 6.6% were up from last year, primarily due to favorable changes in contract estimates, partially offset by lower risk retirement on VCS program. At Mission Technologies revenues of $600 million increased $363 million compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the acquisition of Alion in the third quarter of last year. Mission Technologies operating income up $25 million compared to operating income of $13 million in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter 2022 results included a non-recurring gain of approximately $15 million related to higher equity income from our ship repair and specialty fabrication joint venture of which we are a minority owner. Additionally results included approximately $24 million of amortization of Alion-related purchase of intangible assets. Mission Technologies, EBITDA margin in the second quarter was a robust 10.7%. Turning to Slide 8, cash provided by operations was $267 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $59 million or 2.2% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of $208 million. This compares to cash from operations of $96 million, net capital expenditures of $73 million or 3.3% of revenues and free cash flow of $23 million in the second quarter of 2021. Cash contributions to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans were $11 million in the quarter of which less than $1 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans. During the second quarter, we paid dividends of $1.18 per share of $47 million. We also repurchased approximately 80,000 shares during the quarter at an aggregate cost of approximately $17 million. Turning to Slide 9, we are reaffirming our 2022 ship building sales and margin guidance, as well as our Mission Technologies, margin guidance and overall free cash flow expectations, while modestly revising our Mission Technologies revenue outlook, given a slower start to the year. For Mission Technologies, we are revising our revenue expectation to a range of between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion. This revision is a function of a slower award in contracting environment than we had initially expected and precipitated by the continuing resolution to start the year. That said we remain very confident and excited by the growth opportunity we see ahead for Mission Technologies. Regarding our near-term outlook, our second quarter results were positively impacted by higher risk retirement and favorable changes in contract estimates, particularly for LPD-30, as reflected in the Ingalls operating margin. The remaining ship building milestones we expect to achieve in 2022 are waited towards the fourth quarter. Given that backdrop, we expect the third quarter ship building revenue to be relatively flat sequentially and ship building operating margin to be approximately 7%. Regarding Mission Technologies, we expect results will begin to ramp more meaningfully as the pace of awards increases and expect third quarter sequential sales growth in the 7% to 9% range and operating margin in-line with our full-year guidance of approximately 2.5%. Regarding our longer-term targets, we remain confident in our free cash flow target of $3.2 billion from 2020 through 2024. This outlook does assume the continued expensing of research and development costs for tax purposes. As a reminder, we believe the impact to 2022 free cash flow would be approximately $100 million if the current R&D amortization treatment remains in place. On Slide 10, we have provided a walk from our 2022 to 2024 free cash flow outlook, which is consistent with the chart we began providing earlier this year. Our strong free cash flow performance in the quarter was partially due to the pull forward from the third quarter, given this dynamic and the lack of milestones in the third quarter, we expect free cash flow to be minimal. As a result, we do expect robust free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter and do see positive tailwinds on our overall 2022 free cash flow guidance. As we are in the midst of our annual long-term plan update, our reserve and update to our free cash flow guidance until that is completed and we'll have more details on our third quarter call. Lastly, we are reaffirming our capital allocation priorities and we are committing today to return substantially all free cash flow after planned debt repayment to shareholders through 2024. This is a significant commitment, which should result in increased share repurchases, particularly in 2024, after we reached our desired debt level. To summarize, this was a strong quarter and we are pleased with our progress as we continue to navigate a challenging operating environment. With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris for some final remarks before we take your questions.
Chris Kastner: Thanks Tom. In conclusion, I will wrap up on Slide 11 with the key tenants of our investment thesis. First we're focused on execution of our significant backlog, which provides meaningful earnings and cash flow. This coupled with our consistent long-term ship building growth profile and high growth opportunities in Mission Technologies positions us to deliver significant free cash flow and generate value for our employees, customers, and shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Christie for Q&A.
Christie Thomas: Thanks, Chris.  Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Robert Springer from Melius Research. Robert, please go ahead.
Robert Springer: Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning, Rob.
Robert Springer: Chris or Tom, because you both talked about it, the strong Ingalls margin sounds like that was LPD-30 primarily, but you didn't change the ship building margin guide. So I assume that was expected from the outset or does this reflect maybe some increased costs from labor and such in the back half of the year?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, that's a good question. This is Chris I'll start and then Tom can finish here. That was a bit of an acceleration in that milestone so we got some benefit in Q2, but labor, as I indicated previously is our greatest risk, what we're watching across the portfolio, in ship building, we've hired 2,000 to over to 5,000 commitment. Now, luckily we have leased labor and we have overtime and the good news there is people are actually working overtime now. Back in 2021 and after the pandemic started, it was really hard to get people to work overtime. So they started to come back and work overtime, which helps to offset it, but labor remains our large risk. So I'll kick it over to Tom.
Tom Stiehle: Sure. Just additional comment on that front is we had a milestone that LPD-30 milestone that we referenced that was planned for Q3 that accelerated to Q2. So that's the timing event, Q2 was a good quarter for Ingalls overall. They had some DDG 121 post-delivery, clean up LPD-28 and LPD-29s, some additional risk retirements. And then on the large deck, we saw like a couple of dollars that popped into Q2 there. I still think on the back end, the reason why we haven't raised guidance is we don't have as many milestones. We do have DDG 123 in Q4 and there is the back half of the year to play out as Chris has, we're watching higher and how that impacts the portfolio here right now. And as the year unfolds and we continue to retire risk we'll provide additional guidance in that front.
Robert Springer: So just on the back of that, I mean, it sounds like you'd have upside otherwise, but how do we quantify what this leased labor and just labor inflation in general over time you talked about how does that structurally change the cost of labor in the business, if it lingers for a while?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, that's a great question. Obvious we're fortunate in that we have labor agreements for our own employees, but leased labor can be bit more expensive now they don't have the benefits. So you have to trade that off a bit. So what you do is you put estimates for what you think you're going to do in leased labor overtime in your EACs and that's been reflected in our margin profile. So I think it's a great question. You have to be mindful of that.
Robert Springer: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibiski from Alembic Global. Pete, please go ahead.
Pete Skibiski: Hey, good morning guys. Tom, I guess on, on the expectation that share repurchase will ramp in 2024, I think you mentioned we should â when we're trying to figure that out the level of that, we should assume that you're going to pay off all the debt that's maturing essentially, you're not going to refinance?
Tom Stiehle: That's correct. You can see we're on a cadence here about $100 million, a quarter for 100 year. We'll continue to go do that in 2022, 2023 we pay down the two-year bond, 2023, the term loan gets paid off in completion in Q3 and you can see that. So we'll follow our capital allocation policy that we have. We'll continue to keep the yard up and running. We don't see any holes in the portfolio from an M&A perspective and barring that there's nothing ultra attractive in that timeframe. We'll continue to provide all excess free cash flow back to the shareholders. And basically that desk slug that I've talked about will just kind of transition into repos if we don't have anything better to do with cash.
Pete Skibiski: Okay. Thank you for that. And last one for me. Chris, are we â how are you feeling in terms of extending the amphibious kind of life cycle at Ingalls? I know there were some, some concerns there on the LPD line, on the LHA line and it seems like you're making some progress. Do you feel like you're kind of out of the woods there as long as the kind of momentum you're seeing in Congress continues?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So definitely some positive momentum, we're about halfway through. We like to say that it's a long process, positive momentum on LHA-10, acceleration LPD-33 and some really positive developments by the navy and the Marine Corps on establishing 31 amphibious, which provides some clarity from a planning standpoint. So yeah, positive momentum but we need to get through the process to completion. It solidifies the revenue profile thatâs coupled with DDG 51, the 2023 multi-year that we're working on. All of that, all that activity within the 2023 budget really solidifies the Ingalls revenue profile moving forward.
Pete Skibiski: Great, thanks guys.
Chris Kastner: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research Partners. Robert, please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning/
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Chris, I'll start with you following up on the labor issue. I wonder if you could also comment, not just on the numbers but the experience and skillset of the folks you've been able to get through the door how that compares to your target?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So it's over the last couple years, we do have a newer and greener workforce and we work very hard to train and get that workforce ready to be productive. So it's not new or unexpected for us. We've done it before. But it definitely is a greener workforce. That's why I mentioned the operating system in my script. It's very important that you kind of get into the fundamentals and make sure that all our ship builders are very productive. So, but you are correct. We do have a greener workforce today, but it's not unexpected. We've seen that for the last couple of years.
Robert Stallard: Okay. And then quick follow-up for Tom, I was wondering if you could give us the latest prognosis on the pension, given that all the markets moves we see and also because base rates going higher?
Tom Stiehle: Yeah. Sure. So appreciate the question. It is volatile out there, both on the capital front, interest rates on the market front. Right now, there's a favorability for the higher discount rates, which is partially offset by the unfavorable returns on the assets. And it's hard to predict right now how that play-out by year end, but we do the re-measurement at the end of the year. But consistent with the prior years, we still will provide an update on our Q3 call for 2022 and then the outlook for 2023.
Robert Stallard: Okay. That's great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan, Seth, please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hey thanks very much. Good morning. Just real quick, apologize if I missed it, but if you could quantify the EACs and roughly how they were allocated between the yards?
Tom Stiehle: Sure. Great, Seth. Yeah it's net of $68 million, it was 106 favorable, 38 unfavorable and on the net for $68 million, it was split between Ingalls, Newport News and Mission Technologies a ratio of 80:15:5, so 68 net 80:15:5.
Seth Seifman: Cool, very good and just as a quick follow-up appreciate the some of the pace of contracting activity in Mission Technologies and we've seen it in other companies in IT Services space. But I guess, if you could speak to the level of quarterly visibility that you have in that business, just given that the â not only did the guidance come down a little bit for the year, but the quarter itself fell a little bit short and so how you â what gives you confidence in sort of the remainder of the year there?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, So I'll start and I'll let Tom. In the pipeline within our presentation because we wanted to make sure everybody understood that there was a lot of opportunity in this space. It has started slow for the beginning of the year, but the wind of DMATS which will help backlog and then book-to-bill in Q3 and the win of the LVC contract with the air force, which really transition to legacy established program from the Navy established that over that end of the air force, which will allow us to sell to other services as well. It is a really good indicator that things are hopefully starting to break loose and really validates our strategy for the Alion acquisition. So we are seeing some things break loose. We're going to have to see how that translates into revenue. But I'll let Tom talk about how it's distributed by quarter.
Tom Stiehle: Yeah, sure. So just from a baseline perspective on this question, it was $590 million in the first quarter we had gotten about 5% on $620 million, we did stop in light here at $600 million, so we finished the year off just at under $1.2 million with a run rate at like $23.80 million against initial guidance of $2.6 billion, so that's background. Going forward we do think that we'll see for Q3 a run rate here of what we said the growth would be, which would be 7% to 9%. I don't know if you noticed enough, but in the PowerPoint briefing up front, we added Mission Technology slide and how we look at that business. Alion has a legacy process there, very robust on their pipeline and how they handle their work. Exploratory, $61 billion down to $27 billion on the Exploratory side, they break that down to which opportunities that they can qualify and capture. And then that goes into the evaluations it did. So we see that pipeline actually growing from the time that we picked them up last year. So that's a positive sign right now. As Chris said, we were impacted at the beginning of the year with the CRA and then just the general outflow of contracting and acquisitions have been a little bit slower than we thought. We have seen some awards that popped on here in the end of Q2 timeframe. And there's still additional opportunity that will happen on the back half of the year. So I'm still optimistic on the awards front. The other piece that holds us up there is, we do have more seats than we have heads right now. So like the shipyard, there's a hiring crunch there. The job market is tight, finding people with that type of background and tickets, so there's seats there we have unfilled and that brings in some variability on the sales outcome of the year. But we still have the $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. We haven't let go of the top end, depending on a couple of awards, which the awards will really affect next year sales and this, and filling the seats that are unoccupied. We believe that we're still in the range there between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thanks for the detailed responses. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Gautam, please go ahead.
Gautam Khanna: Hey, good morning guys.
Chris Kastner: Good morning Gautam.
Gautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the VCS program. There's been a lot of press and GAO, and industry scuttle about the program being well behind schedule. And obviously you guys took a big charge in Q2 of 2020. It looks like there was another negative EAC in this quarter. Just where are we on the program relative to your expectations? And if you could just maybe give us some color on what your accrual rate might be so that we should either beâ¦
Chris Kastner: Yes. So thanks. Itâs â I'm sorry. I'll let you finish. Did you have anything else?
Gautam Khanna: No, please. No, that's great. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Okay, great. Yes, so the VCS program, I would characterize that as stable from a scheduling standpoint and over the last few quarters, pretty stable from a EAC standpoint actually. There's always minor adjustments from quarter-to-quarter but I think some of the data you may be referencing is a bit dated as you know, we do quarterly EACs. We incorporate the risk in all of the ships and boats on a quarterly basis. So I'm pretty comfortable with where we are from an EAC standpoint on the VCS. I don't think anything is â any of us are comfortable relative to the how we performed historically on the program, we need to improve, right. I think the Newport News team is very motivated and dedicated to getting it right. They're making progress. There's some potential momentum within Block 4 which we ought to translate into Block 5. I think there's some upside in Block 5. So I think the team is very focused. I think they're working the operating system very well. We need to get back to two per year. We need to get these assets back to our customer because they need them. So I would consider it stable from a schedule standpoint and we need to continue to improve from a cost standpoint. And any details I'll send over to Tom here.
Tom Stiehle: Sure. Yes. I think when we took that charge back in Q2 of 2020, the preface of that was we had a list already with Columbia coming online, we saw that ramping up. And then getting to full two cadences launch and sell off a ship a year. There was already a list and a risk and a hiring ramp right there, obviously in 2020 after two quarters of that, it kind of midyear we saw with COVID impacting us. And then obviously, that continued without a prime into 2021. So there's been pressure on the program from what was the baseline of already being able to do two plus one between those two programs, hiring ramp with more junior people on board. And then that line that we've talked about in the past calls is very serial in nature, more than any of our other lines, each boat goes exactly through crew to crew. So if one boat in front of us gets impacted, it affects the line behind it, both the crews being able to cycle and then the schedule aspect of each boat. So I think when we took that look, see where we were in Q2 of 2020. We had a perspective of what was in the order was possible and how we could recover or we'll finish off the back end of Block 4 as that translates into Block 5. So I think as Chris says, we're relying on operating system, we're trying to stay to our manning plan that we have. We're doing lessons learned from boat to boat. We are seeing incremental improvement from operational where we were a quarter ago to now. So that's a positive sign right now. And as Chris says, we run a very rigorous EAC process and we look at our labor and material and overhead, a run-out, reevaluating our booking rates, the changes on that large. So you don't see them on the downside there, but we do have incremental changes from quarter-to-quarter here. So possible with where we're booking these ships right now.
Gautam Khanna: Thank you very much, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. George, please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Good morning,
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Tom Stiehle: Good morning.
George Shapiro: My question is if you take your EACs, it would imply the underlying margin that Ingalls is like 7.9%, which is generally higher than what you've seen in the past around 7%. So I was just wondering, is that just unique to this quarter? Or is this more of an ongoing underlying margin rate?
Chris Kastner: Yes, it is a little bit of unique for this quarter. That's a high number. The run range from Ingalls is usually lower than upper 6s and low 7s. I think just how all the map kind of like played out with the performance list. We talked about the economic adjustments that were allowed because of the clauses that we have in the contract. So you may just be a little high there, but generally speaking, we've talked about the maturity, the portfolio data at Ingalls, more our serial production and follow on ships down there. So their run rate is out in front of Newport News. And we generally say it's between 6% and 7%. So I'd leave you with that, George.
George Shapiro: Yes, no, that's really the question. If I did the numbers this quarter, it looks like it would come out to seven, nine. And like you suggest it's normally like closer to seven. So I'm just wondering if there's something unique that made this quarter out of line or is it at new run rate?
Chris Kastner: It's not a new run rate. It's just how the match plays out to the quarter.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, George.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. David, please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
David Strauss: Tom, wanted to ask about the free cash flow of cadence. I know you mentioned Q3 close to, I guess zero break-even but I think you're still calling for a pretty meaningful working capital tailwind in the second half of the year, it looks like CapEx might be trending towards the lower end of your range. What keeps you from coming in a decent amount above kind of the 300 to 350, assuming R&D, it doesn't happen?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So astute question and you're putting pieces together out there, as we highlighted in the opening comments, we did say 300 to 350, we're holding that, that right now. I do feel comfortable that with the risk we've seen behind us and in front of us, we still have like five months of the year to play out. But right now, we do see although Q3 will be light just the way that year is playing out, Q2 and Q4 are going to be the cash flow quarters. But I do see we've been â the COVID repay is pushed to the back half of the year. And as I come through our planning process and I have the complete visibility in how the year is going to play out is the COVID repay either happening this year or next year, that's more of a timing play, the R&D amortization. You reference we'll see how that plays, but that could be the $100 million that we talk about as a down take this year could go away. And if the law changes, this seems like there's some traction and momentum to get attached to a bill at the back half of the year. That changes over. We could see the 100 million go away as we force out on a downside, and then it would validate the 3.2 billion over the five years. Cash from operations was very strong in Q2. We saw some nice pickups as far as older contracts, some service contracts we're able to get COVID costs that we had on our books included in our billing rates. So that was a pickup. And that's how Q2 kind of played out. When you think about Q4 on the back half of the year, I have 123 delivery. On the DDG side, I have a couple of supply capital incentives that play out LHA 8 billings, LHA 9 with the construction award helped clean up the long-lead contract that I have on there for cash. And then CVN 81 is going to be able to have progress payment billings as they work through kind of getting into Q4. We have some incentives on BCF and then Laurie Knowles kind of kick in that I'll use at the end of the year, too. So a good upside potential there, but I'm not ready to call that ball until I can get through our planning process.
David Strauss: Okay. Thanks. And I mean, is any of this borrowing from kind of the upside, you've talked about for 2023 going up to 750 to 800, or you think maybe there's a little bit upside, but the plans full unpack to get to those kind of numbers in 2023?
Chris Kastner: So just to be clear, the majority of what I talked about is in the plan and the forecast right now, those things could kick out, $25 million, $50 million, $75 million upside, the tiny aspect would be the COVID repay. So if I do not have to pay it at the end of this year that would be a pull forward from 2023 to now. But I believe by the time we have our Q3 call in November, I have complete clarity into that and I give you more visibility to that.
David Strauss: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Ron, please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning guys. Maybe why donât you just walk through a couple different programs and how things are going? In the unmanned underwater vehicle business, I mean, how's Excel UUV coming for you guys with Boeing?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So Excel is progressing, right. We've delivered our first unit to Boeing really kind of a test unit. We're progressing through the other units, so it's going okay. I think normal, first of class issues that you have on a new program, on a development sort of program. So it's going okay.
Ron Epstein: Okay, great. And then maybe just another program, if we can, on the next-generation destroyer, where does that stand and when do you think, there'd be competition for that and what's going on there, if you could give us an update on the DDG(X)?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So I think you may have seen in the press, we got the next contract for development there, kind of concept development working. I think the Navy's done some really smart things in this regard and with Bath and Ingalls working on the development of that program. I think the important thing on the DDG programs is to ensure we don't stop building DDG 51s prior to transitioning, getting the design correct on the next-generation destroyer. And I think that's a smart move. I think they're continuing with the design effort in both shipyards and we're continuing to build DDG 51. So I think it makes great sense right now.
Ron Epstein: Okay. Okay. Okay. And then I might have missed this, but maybe not. Where did we stand on the Coast Guard offshore patrol cutter? Was that formally awarded yet or where did we stay on that program?
Chris Kastner: Yes, it was awarded, it was not awarded to us. It was disappointing. We know how to build those ships. Coast Guard is a great customer. But we were not awarded that.
Ron Epstein: Is there another opportunity for that poll in another competition?
Chris Kastner: Not sure. I mean, they're just coming through this competition for the next block of those boats. So not sure at this point.
Ron Epstein: Got it. Got it. And maybe just one last one, what â when we look down the road at maybe in future things you potentially could be bidding for, what can we be looking out for?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So interesting. Newport News is full, right. They've got a lot of the work to do. They're executing on it. And their legacy programs will continue over the medium to long-term actually, Ingalls is based on the pace of LHAs and LPDs, they're going to be in a very good place, but they have other opportunities. They have a DDG 1000 is down there now, and they're doing some combat system upgrades for that. And there's potential other DDG 1000 work that might be available. And then other repair sort of activity, but Ingalls is a pretty scrappy group. I wouldn't count them out and with the pace of LHAs and LPDs we've got a lot of time to figure that out.
Ron Epstein: Okay, great. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. So Iâd now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Kastner for any closing remarks.
Chris Kastner: Okay. Thank you for your interest in HII. We welcome your continued engagement and feedback. Please have a safe and great rest of summer. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the First Quarter 2022 HII Earnings Conference Call.  I'd now like to hand over the call to Christie Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Thomas, you may begin.

We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at hii.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris Kastner. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Christy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call. Earlier this morning we reported solid performance across each of our operating divisions. With our focus on execution and growth positioning us to reaffirm our previous revenue, margin, and free cash flow guidance. Our Shipbuilding emission technologies teams continue to execute well despite basically some headwinds in the areas of human capital and supply chain disruption. Like the economy broadly we are facing challenges created by the lingering effects of COVID and its impact on the labor market, making it challenging to hire and retain employees. Moreover, our suppliers are being impacted by the same shortage of labor as well as inflation issues, which creates risk of delays in delivery of key materials for our shipbuilding programs. We are aggressively working these challenges with our suppliers and our customers. In light of both of these challenges, I'm extremely proud of the resilience and the dedication of each of our 44,000 employees to continue to focus on our mission of delivering on their customer commitments. Now, shifting to our results. Sales of $2.6 billion for the quarter were 30% higher than 2021and diluted EPS of 350 for the quarter was down from 368 in 2021. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $2 billion, driven by the award for DDG 139. This results in backlog of $47.9 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $24.8 billion is currently funded. At Ingalls LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale completed sea trials and was delivered to the Navy. LPD 29 Richard M McCool Jr was launched and we laid keel for LPD 30 Harrisburg. On LHA program, LHA 8 Bougainville is progressing well and long-lead material procurement has begun for LHA 9. On the DDG program, DDG 123 Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee achieved main engine light off and DDG 125 Jack H Lucas was christened this quarter. And finally on the NSC program serial production continues on NSC 10 Calhoun launched in April. At Newport News, SSN 794 Montana completed sea trials and was delivered to the Navy and SSN 796 New Jersey floated off in April. Also, as discussed in our fourth quarter call SSN 725 USS Helena was redelivered in January, which demonstrated the successful reconstitution of our submarine maintenance capability in support of the Navy. On the carrier front, Newport News in the Navy celebrated a centennial of US Navy aircraft carriers and CVN 78 USS Gerald R Ford was redelivered to the Navy in the first quarter, after completion of its inaugural maintenance and modernization period. Progress continued on CVN 79 Kennedy, which is 83% complete and CVN 80 enterprise has begun erecting steel on the dry-dock. On the RCOH program CVN 73 USS George Washington is progressing in the testing phase and is 95% complete and CVN 74 USS John T Stennis is approximately 25% complete. A few weeks ago we renamed our Technical Solutions division mission technologies to better reflect our portfolio of capabilities and our commitment to delivering advanced technologies in multi-domain expertise to our support of our national security customers. Contract towards emission technologies have had a slow start to the year, but this was largely due to the continuing resolution and the resulting lack of adjudication of awards. Looking ahead, we are very excited about our pipeline of new business Mission technologies and are confident it will support our growth objectives. We currently have almost $6 billion of proposals in evaluation with $3 billion in proposal development and a total qualified pipeline of more than $25 billion. We had a significant win in unmanned with the selection of our REMUS 300 vehicle as the US Navy's next generation small UUV program of record. We also recently released Odyssey a suite of advanced autonomy solutions that offer salable autonomy, across the variety of platforms and is aligned with the industry open architecture standards. Regarding our Shipbuilding workforce, I'm glad to report that we finalized the collective bargaining agreements at both shipyards. Our annual apprentice school graduation at Newport News Shipbuilding saw 170 graduates and over 200 individuals will complete their apprenticeship program in May at Ingalls Shipbuilding and we continue to work with local high schools and community colleges on our core hiring and development needs. Through the end of the quarter we had hired over 1,000 craft personnel, towards our plan of over 5,000 for the year, we remain focused on hiring and retaining a strong workforce, as we continue to face the headwinds of a tight labor market. Turning to activities in Washington, Congress finalized appropriations for fiscal year 2022 in March. We saw continued bipartisan support for our programs reflected in the Final Defense Appropriations Act including funding for two Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers and two Virginia-class attack submarines. Additionally, the appropriations measures provided $250 million for advance procurement funding for LPD 32, advance procurement for DDGs as well as funding for our other programs. Also in March, the President submitted his fiscal year 2023 budget request, now under consideration by Congress. The proposed budget reflects continued investment in our shipbuilding programs funding two amphibious ships LPD 32 and LHA 9, two DDG-51 surface combatants and two Block 5 Virginia-class submarines. The budget request continues funding for class nuclear aircraft carriers and aircraft carrier refueling programs and construction of Columbia class submarines, as well as investment in the submarine industrial base. Beyond Shipbuilding the fiscal year 2023 request reflects an emphasis on research and development with the increased investments in capability enablers such as AI, Cyber, Electronic Warfare, C5, ISR and autonomous systems. The line well with our advanced technology capabilities of our mission technologies division. In conclusion, we remain well positioned to execute on our shipbuilding backlog and leverage it to generate significant free cash flow while continuing to capture anticipated work and growth within our mission technologies division. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financial results. Tom.
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I'll briefly review our first quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation our first quarter revenues of $2.6 billion increased approximately 13% compared to the same period last year. This was largely due to revenue attributable to the acquisition of a line in the third quarter of 2021. Operating income for the quarter of $130 million decreased by $9 million from the first quarter of 2021 and operating margin of 5.4% decreased 110 basis points. These decreases were largely due to lower segment operating income driven by lower risk retirement at Newport News Shipbuilding, partially offset by more favorable non-current state income taxes and operating fast cash adjustment compared to the prior year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 20.5% compared to approximately 40.5% in the first quarter of 2021. The lower rate in the first quarter of 2021 was primarily due to divestitures during that quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $140 million compared to $148 million in the first quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.50 compared to $3.68 in the first quarter of 2021. Turning to Slide 5. Cash used by operations was $83 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $43 million or 1.7% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of negative $126 million. This compares to cash from operations of $43 million and net capital expenditures of $59 million and free cash flow of negative $16 million in the first quarter of 2021. Cash contributions to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans were $10 million in the quarter, of which, less than $1 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans. During the first quarter, we paid dividend of $1.18 per share of $47 million. We also repurchased 51,000 shares during the quarter, an aggregate cost of $10 million. Moving on to Slide 6, Ingalls revenues of $631 million in the quarter decreased $18 million or 2.8% from the same period last year, driven primarily by lower on the DDG program, partially offset by high amphibious assault ship revenues. Ingalls operating income of $86 million and margin of 13.6% in the quarter were down slightly from last year due to lower risk retirement on the LHA and DDG programs, which was largely offset by increased risk retirement on the LPD program, following the delivery of LPD28. At Newport News, revenues of $1.4 billion, decreased by $17 million or 1.2% from the same period last year due to lower aircraft carrier and naval nuclear support service revenues largely offset by higher submarine revenue. Newport News operating income of $81 million and margin of 5.8%, we're down from last year, primarily due to lower risk retirement on the VCS program partially offset by higher risk retirement on CVN 78. At Mission technologies revenues of $590 million increased $331 million compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the acquisition of Alion in the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by the divestiture of our oil and gas business and the contribution of the San Diego Shipyard to a joint venture in the first quarter of 2021. Mission technologies operating income of $9 million compared to an operating income of $7 million in the first quarter of 2021 first quarter 2022 results included approximately $24 million of amortization of Alion-related purchase intangible assets. Mission Technologies' EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 7.3%. Turning to Slide 7, we are reaffirming our 2022 sales margin and free cash flow expectations and have slightly revise our pension expectations. During the quarter, we reached a labor agreement with the United Steel workers at Newport News Shipbuilding. The contract includes increases in pension benefits triggering a pension remeasurement which also takes into account discount rate changes and asset returns through late February. Regarding our near-term outlook, our first quarter results were positively impacted by a very high quality, delivery for LPD 28, which allowed us to retire a significant amount of risk for that ship in the first quarter as reflected in the Ingalls operating margin. The remaining Shipbuilding milestones, we expect to achieve in 2022 our back-end weighted. Given that backdrop we expect the second quarter shipbuilding revenue to be relatively flat sequentially and shipbuilding operating margin to be approximately 7%. Regarding mission technologies, we expect results will ramp through the year with second quarter sales, up approximately 5% sequentially, and operating margin in line with our full year guidance of approximately 2.5%. Regarding our longer-term targets, we remain confident in our free cash flow of $3.2 billion from 2020 through 2024. This outlook does assume that continue to expensing of research and development costs for tax purposes. As a reminder, we believe the impact to 2022 free cash flow would be approximately $100 million if the current R&D amortization treatment remains in place. On Slide 8, we provided a walk from our 2022 to 2024 free cash flow outlook. This is consistent with the chart we began providing last quarter. Additionally, we are reaffirming our capital allocation priorities, which include significant deleveraging in the near term, along with continued modest dividend growth and balance share repurchases. We will continue to evaluate M&A, but we know significant capability gaps today. In closing, we are pleased with the operational milestones achieved in the first quarter along with the financial results. Notwithstanding the challenges of the current environment, we remain enthusiastic regarding our long-term outlook, with nearly $50 billion in backlog, strong budgetary and customer support for our shipbuilding programs and emission technology business that we believe is poised for very strong growth. We are laser focused on consistent execution and generating sustainable long-term value. Now I'll turn the call back over to Kristie for Q&A.
Christie Thomas: Thanks, Tom. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator:  Our first question goes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Robert. Please go ahead with your question.
Robert Stallard: Chris. I'll start off with you a bigger picture question on the FY22 request. It looks like the year maybe is changing as planned for amphibious vessels proposed into this, how do you think this could play out and what's potentially the risk to HIIs. And then secondly, numbers question perhaps for Tom you mentioned on Slide 8, the potential for margin growth in mission. I was wondering what the sort of better long-term margin could be for this division because 0.25 pretty low compared to other companies in the industry. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Yes, okay. Robert, I'll start with the budget, the '23 budget request and then Tom can talk about Mission Technologies margins. One thing we should always remember with the budgetary process, this is the first step of the process. So we all work through that throughout the year, all our major ship building programs were supported the one line we do have to work on is the NCIB line as you identified. We need to get LPD 32 under contracts. We need to get LHA 9 under contract. We need to work on LPD 33 and ensure that we support the Marines and the Navy and the Congress really in analyzing that program going forward. So you're right, we do need to work on the NCIB line but I'm positive as we work through this process that will get to a solution that that makes a lot of sense. From a long-term big picture perspective, I think that the budget really does support our long-term growth rate, and I'm comfortable with the 3%.
Tom Stiehle: Sure, Rob, and I'll pick up the question on MT from a margin perspective, 1.5%. So we got guided 1%. So it's higher than the guidance that's coming up 2.7% last year, 2.7% last year for Q1 and 2.9% for a quarter ago in Q4. I would tell you that because of the purchase intangibles both with empty about $30 million in line specifically for 24 net return on sales metric is not, probably a good lead indicator as far as where we want to land that's why we kind of give you the EBITDA perspective from 8% to 8.5%. The quarter herewith was 7.3%, not unexpected, because we guided you from a gross perspective only at 1%. We take with the CRM or sales light and obviously the margin will follow the sales, so we're comfortable with where we stand and from a perspective of where we could go, we've told you for the year is 8% to 8.5% from an EBITDA perspective as a percent of revenue and from now going through 2024 we've highlighted that it's more appropriate to think about 8% to 10%is is a range at where MT can land. All right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global Advisors. Pete, your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question.
Pete Skibitski: Chris also a question on the fit-up, one thing that's always a little bit hard to tell, timing-wise is just maintenance trend, ship building maintenance trend. Can you give us a sense of if you see, if you look at the fit-up, you know, should mean is be a tailwind for you guys are starting to flatten out. I just wonder what your thoughts were.
Chris Kastner: Yes, I think it's pretty flat. They're coming through the submarine kind of maintenance schedule and how they're going to proceed with LA class and Virginia-class submarines from maintenance standpoint, but we think it's pretty, pretty flat from our perspective. Lots going to go into how they execute the sign up, but we think it's pretty flat.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. And then one last question kind of off-the-beaten-path, there was an export notification back in December forum for emails and Advanced Arresting Gear to France in both you guys and General Atomics were excited. Is that any kind of a meaningful or a real revenue opportunity for you guys. And I'm just curious about the timing as well on that.
Chris Kastner: Yes, not for us now, remember we don't, GA provides those system, so not for us now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Seth, your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question.
Seth Seifman: I think you mentioned on the last call you mentioned Chris that you guys had a lot of confidence in the hiring your ability to hire this year and you started off this call focusing especially on the tight labor market. So maybe if you could just give a little bit of color on how things are tracking there any metrics we can think about kind of, what you need to do and then kind of where the risk would be in the financial plan if to the extent that that the hiring situation gets tougher.
Chris Kastner: Sure Seth. Thanks. January and February were tough on really impacted our attendance. But in March attendance recovered and we're back to tenants levels that we're used to seeing within both of our shipyards. We've hired over 1,000 people through the end of March. We need to hire over 5,000, so a bit behind, but we're really focused on our relationships with our apprentice schools and high schools, community colleges and we expect that to ramp over the summer months graduations happened. So it's definitely a watch item. We need to, we need to hire, we need to train and we need to be productive. So still comfortable with our guidance but labor is a watch item for us as we move through the year.
Seth Seifman: All right. And just a follow-up, is it more about, I mean I would think people come in in the summer there. There's probably only so much contribution they can make in a couple of months. And so, is this, is this really more about of setting up for 2023 and then to the extent you have an idea of how you are set up for 2023 that would affect you're the risk tolerance that you have in your, in your estimates completion.
Chris Kastner: Yes, when they come out of the apprentice schools they're ready to go and if they can come out of the community colleges and the high schools where we have programs in place where there, they're learning. They're going to fill a critical role within the shipyard. Now they're not going to be first-class shipbuilders right away, but they're going to be learning, they're going to be making progress on executing, its all incumbent on our shipbuilding teams to make sure they're trained up and they've got the right mentorship and we did have very well. So yes, they're not going to be first class the shipbuilders coming out of the out of the gate, but we expect them to contribute.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Doug, your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question.
Doug Harned: I'd like to just spend a little bit of time on Virginia class. I mean it was identified as a margin headwind in this quarter and the Newport News. If I go back to when you had the issues back in 2020, it was the Montana, the New Jersey, the Massachusetts those I mean the Montana is deliver in New Jersey float off. Then one of the big issues then was this question of lots of new people in a complex environment needing to train them and so some of the issues you had then were attributed to that. If you look at the situation on Virginia class today where does it stand because it seems that you might run into some of these similar issues as you try and bring a lot of new people in it. So how are you looking at the Virginia class performance right now.
Chris Kastner: Yes, Doug. It's a good question and I appreciate it. Remember the issues we had previously we were in the heart of COVID right and we had a significant outs and significant labor issues with the Newport News, which drove, which drove a lot of that but what we're seeing now is it's interesting we talk about serial production line, but the VCS program is really a production line. And when you miss you miss schedule, there's a knock-on effect. So, as you know, we missed a couple of schedules at the end of the year that drifted into Q1. We've accomplished those and it's really had an impact on the future shifts and so we had to deal with that in the quarter, we reassessed our risk and you see the results in Q1. That being said, there is some stability in that workforce. Now the tendency has recovered. We're a bit short of our hiring plans, but it's not like what happened during COVID. The team is very focused on meeting their interim milestones working that offers operating system very diligently. I got a lot of confidence that there is actually some upside as we move through the next couple of years on the VCS program.
Doug Harned: So if you look at and if going forward you're finishing the Massachusetts your own, your own boats in the Arkansas. And then you will go into block five. How do you, how do you, how should we think about kind of performance and margin trajectory as you move through those as well as the work that you're doing for the electric boat the modules for electric boat but I mean how has this risk retirement likely to move in in your thinking.
Chris Kastner: Yes. So we've, we've assessed RACs in the risk on not only block four but block five boats and reset the GACS based upon how we, how we project them to perform over the life of both of those block. So we don't necessarily give margin guidance at a program level, but I do see after resetting that risk on block five going forward there is potential for upside if we're able to meet our milestones.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Myles Walton from UBS. Myles, your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about carriers for a second and in particular the 79 and the 73. So on the 79, I think the progress the completion metric you guys provide in the press release every quarter, it really hasn't moved in the last several quarters. And I know one of the adjustments, which were the single phase delivery but I don't think that would have played out here in the first quarter. So any reason why there wasn't progress there. And then just a comment on the 73 and if the slip to 2023 made any difference for your financials. Thanks.
Tom Stiehle: So I'll take the 73one on the back of that. So right now we're still bringing that ship and trying to target for yearend completion through the EAC process. We are evaluating some risks to the schedule on that, that wasn't incorporate into the Q1 EAC share.
Chris Kastner: Yes, 79 were absolutely making progress on that ship from we're heavily into the volume part of that ship, completing compartments. If you walk through the, you walk through the base and that ship right now, you see a lot of installation of paint, which is a good place to be. When you think about an aircraft carrier attacking that volume and then starting to test program. I don't know specifically about the math around the, around the progress Christy yield fill you in, in that after the call. But they're very dedicated and making progress, really on a weekly basis on the aircraft carrier.
Myles Walton: So no movement to the expected delivery on that vessel.
Chris Kastner: No, absolutely not.
Myles Walton: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Gotham Khanna from Cowen. Gautam your line is now open. Please ask your question.
Gautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could refresh us on how your contracts adjust for higher input costs. So whether it be steel, whether it what have you everything like you mentioned at the outset, is moving up in price. How do you recover those, what does that do to margins, is just a pass-through where it actually dampens margins, just if you could walk through the mechanics there. Thanks.
Tom Stiehle: Sure. It's Tom here. Good morning. Yes. So from an inflation perspective break, I know your question is focused on the existing contracts and how that it, I'll hit that but also now we're watching inflation as it applies to our new bids so it's like a two-part answer here but, from the mechanics that we have on how that fits as we spoke about this other earnings calls. And it really starts with our understanding of what we're buying, and how we contract for with these contracts being anywhere from 48 years long. Long-lead contracts upfront with an understanding of the material and the bill of materials. We have a very disciplined and dedicated process to make sure that we have live quotes and bids. And we go hand in glove making sure the quotes have the procurement side and ourselves locked into the contract value from a starting standpoint. So while we have a clear understanding of what we buy and at the onset of these contracts. We have a good bid from our suppliers. We do run into, from time to time as we move forward, we have the contracts awarded things purchased after that and on up commodity buys and we did see increases from time to time on raw materials and commodities. I will tell you that when we have a long lead phase of the contract, it operates almost like a cost-type contract and rolling those actions into the construction. The eventuality of the construction awarded that bit, so that's helpful. Another piece of that is when you look at, you'll see in queue, we have braked out across the three divisions. The percentage of cost type versus fixed-price contracts but from an high from entirely perspective, it's about 50-48 fixed price and cost. So this recruitment there are in the contract type. Mission Technologies has got the 90% cost price and Newport needed 50, 50. So that helps that. Several of our contracts do have EPA policies, which had a, recognizes things that we don't put on contract immediately. We have that risk covered with our bids within the estimated cost from bids that we see at the time of award. And the actual cost that we pay it can get adjusted depending on a inflationary industry. So that helps us on that side as well. Even our flexibly FX, flexibly price contracts there is a share on that. So we work ourselves through that as well. So I think the toolset that we have on how we manage our existing contracts as well as the change management process when we take on new orders to make sure that we maintain the equity of those contracts, keeps us in a relatively safe space. The last one I'd add to you too is a large majority of the cost of our existing contracts is on the labor side and we come through our union agreements, a four year down at Ingalls and a five year here at Newport News. So we understand those costs and there is a schedule of increases and we use that when we put things on contract. So I think overall it's a well-founded process and how we handle it and plays well against these inflationary times. On the new bids, I'll tell you that we're very, we are seeing on new bids price increases along the lead times and we're seeing higher costs kind of year-over-year but we ensure that we follow that same dedicated process of getting live quotes. Our customer sets are understanding of that, I mean, there may they're saying inflationary pressures across the industry and we bring that cost and pricing data for evaluation and make sure that we strike a reasonable risk balance here for inflation against the new awards.
Gautam Khanna: And just the mechanics if you would mind on if the fact you have an EPA and together, is that just an increased revenue and cost and therefore, a document to profit margin.
Tom Stiehle: The back-end of your question. So with all that as the backdrop the mechanics of that obviously we go through our disciplined quarterly EAC process, I mean, we're getting a cost weekly a multi-program to do and then obviously our quarterly EAC process, so we can see how the material is trending both against the existing orders that we have and material requirements in any proper requirements. We'll evaluate that whether the EAC is improving or were degrading and-or the associated risks that we thought were going to be retired for the quarter and the rest of the remaining scope on those contracts that will get incorporated into EAC, if there is an increase obviously there'll be an increase in costs will run that for our, profit tables and it all revise the booking rate accordingly. So all that gets factored in by ship by ship across the program and then it kind of rolls up into our adjustments that you see here. I guess the portfolio.
Chris Kastner: I'd also add that if there is EPA protection, it's an increase in sales without the resultant impact on margin. So that does provide us additional protection and that's in our EAC process as well every quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Springer from Melius Research. Robert your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question.
Robert Springer: Thank you, Good morning. Chris covering questions sort of higher level. A lot of talk about upside to defense spending from Europe. And while the export opportunity probably great for the shipbuilding side, what kinds of products and services from MT do you think will interest European countries.
Chris Kastner: Yes, that's a really good question, we think about it a lot. Unmanned we've sold internationally, about 30% of our unmanned sales have historically been international to NATO countries in nature. And then you think about ISR surveillance, big data platforms, cyber, Intel, all of that as part of mission technologies get some traction internationally. So we work on that, we're very tactical in how we do that we make sure of the opportunity is valid but all those are opportunities in Europe and actually any NATO country actually.
Robert Springer: Okay. And then on the domestic side, the Navy leadership has been talking about priorities as follows top priorities Columbia class then readiness modernization and lethality improvements and then third capacity. So knowing that the commitment to Colombia is rock solid and capacity is really a function of the budget's, future budgets. How do we think about HII's access to the middle part, the readiness in the modernization part and then again, how does that tie with MT.
Chris Kastner: Yes. So interesting readiness and modernization in MT is very interesting tools related to big data and data analytics that absolutely support that. So it definitely helps provide tools and access for our customer to improve their readiness. So I actually, thank you for that question. It's very interesting thing we're working on with our customer. It's all upside. Right, but it will just give our customer additional capabilities. So, thanks for that.
Robert Springer: Chris, do you see any timing or any visibility on when these things start to come through.
Chris Kastner: No, I think unmanned can happen very quickly, the award of small is very important provides us additional opportunity to sell that internationally. The other stuff, we'll just have to see, but I don't see a short-term sort of upside related to it.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. David, your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question.
David Strauss: Good morning. Hey Chris. So I think it was on the last call you talked about the discussions with the Navy in terms of additional investment in the shipyards, and how that was potentially going to be split and what it meant potentially for the expected CapEx drawdown. Can you just update us on where things stand there.
Chris Kastner: Yes, we're still working on it. I think you saw in the three budget additional funding allocated to capital and support of infrastructure in the supply base, we're in discussions with the Navy on that now. And we'll just, we'll just continue to discuss that with them in order to make the investments to support their critical the critical program.
David Strauss: Okay. And Tom, on the, on the working capital side, I think networking capital represents sales that you guys calculate was around 10% this quarter. I think that's the highest we've seen in a while even kind of adjusting for typical seasonality. Can you just talk about the working capital trend through the course of this year and again kind of what you're baking into that free cash flow forecast for '23 and '24 from a working capital perspective. Thanks.
Tom Stiehle: Sure, David. Yes. So it was 10%. So, and that's just upfront is just the timing on the, on the working capital that we have. It's both the timing on the receipts for the accounts receivable and the collections, the payments for the accounts payable. We anticipated it would be high on the front end here right now, a little bit of a draw, as we talked about these milestones of kind of just stretch a little bit on the VCS program. And as we work through the back half of the year, I see that that coming down. We will finish the 2020 year at higher than we were in 2021, but then it's to come back and break our way into 2023.
David Strauss: Okay. What are you targeting from a net working capital as a percent of sales in '23 and '24 specifically.
Tom Stiehle: So we don't give guidance specifically on that, but we are talking about a normal range, our expectations is that 6% to 8%. This 10% is heart of deliberate higher on that range, but not unexpected. We saw in the quarter playing out and then the impact that that we've discussed here. I would tell you that would get back more into that range and into '23. 2023 is a help on cash. And then for '24 about neutral. 2023 and 2024, we've talked about more ship milestones and deliveries in the out years and that's helps to facilitate that working capital coming down from 10% and be more to that 6% to 8% range.
Operator: Thank you very much. And our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. George, your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question.
George Shapiro: Yes, Tom I was wondering if you could just provide what the EA's net EACs were in the quarter by division.
Tom Stiehle: Sure. Yes, on the net EAC George was were $45 million and the split of that was 90% Ingalls and 10% Mission Technologies.
George Shapiro: Say that again. I missed the last sentence.
Tom Stiehle: Yes, it was 107 favorable, 62 unfavorable for net of 45.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then, you had said that the LPD 28 was a major help in the quarter. Is that a singled out number in the queue or no.
Tom Stiehle: You will see that for a $17 million adjustment. Yes. And also, it was a clean DDG-50 or delivery that we had in Q1 we usually get after both deliveries in the following quarter. We'll do a hot wash. The remaining work and this sometimes some profitability. It will happen in the next quarter. So that's been pulled into this quarter too, that kind of factored in in somewhat opening remarks of the 7% shipbuilding expectation in Q2 as we pull that margin into the Q1 time frame.
George Shapiro: Yes. And then if the second quarter is 7%, it would imply that the third and the fourth quarter has got to average at least as good as the first quarter, if not a little better. So if you had this one-time major benefit in the first quarter, what is the benefits you get in the Q3 or Q4 to get that margin better than 8.3% to have the year at 8% to 8.1%.
Tom Stiehle: All right. So we have several milestones on the back half of the year as we continue through the construction process on the LPD program. Milestones that we have know shifts and as we bring people back on board sales will rise with a margin perspective in this some efficiency gains on that. So we still feel comfortable with the 8.1%. We kind of highlighted at the beginning on the February call that it would be right upfront and both the sales and the margin will come in on the back half of the year.
George Shapiro: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you very much. I'm not showing any further questions at this time, I'd now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Kastner for any closing remarks.
Chris Kastner: Thank you again for joining us on today's call and your interest in HII is appreciated. We welcome your continued engagement and feedback. We'll see you out there.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-10 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the call over to Christie Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Thomas, you may begin.
Christie Thomas: Thanks. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Steely, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in their remarks today, Mike, Chris and Tom will refer to certain non-GAAP measures.

We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Christie. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. Before getting into the results for the quarter and the full year, I want to personally thank each of our 44,000 employees for continuing to execute their daily activities with an unwavering commitment to our operational pillars of safety, quality, cost of schedule. 2021 was a year of solid performance and resiliency during the COVID pandemic. At HII, we are committed to promoting and protecting the health and safety of our employees, their families and their communities and continuing to serve our customers in a vital national security interest of our country without disruption as an essential contributor to the nation's critical infrastructure. Most recently faced with uncertainty around the Omicron variant, our employees remain focused on execution, while driving continuous improvement, innovation and creativity. While HII has not become subject to a vaccine mandate through any of our shipbuilding contracts at this time, we continue to be committed to promoting the benefits of a vaccinated workforce. Our Technical Solutions division does have the vaccine requirement in a number of contracts. And currently, we estimate that approximately 81% of our HII full-time employees are fully vaccinated. Earlier this morning, we released our 2021 results which we believe reflect consistent shipbuilding program execution, with year-over-year margin expansion and a transformational year for our Technical Solutions division. During the year, we captured major contract awards resulting in maintaining record backlog levels and we expanded our portfolio by acquiring Alion in our Technical Solutions division. With these actions, HII persevered to diligently pursue the business outcomes of driving growth, managing risk and generating strong returns. Some highlights from the quarter start on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.7 billion for the fourth quarter are down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and sales of $9.5 billion for the full year are up 2% from the full year of 2020. Given the numerous challenges in 2021, we were pleased to finish the year with shipbuilding revenues at the low end of our guidance and we remain confident in the 3% shipbuilding average growth rate over time. We also saw strong growth as anticipated in our Technical Solutions division. Diluted EPS was $2.99 for the quarter and $13.50 for the full year, down from $6.15 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $17.14 for the full year in 2020. Full year segment operating income of $683 million is an increase of $128 million or 23% over 2020. These returns in line with our expectations as a result of continued performance improvement in shipbuilding margins and strong performance in our Technical Solutions division. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $1 billion, resulting in our backlog of approximately $48 billion at the end of the quarter, of which approximately $23 billion is currently funded. Now entering 2022, our shipbuilding programs backlog provides, we believe, unmatched stability and visibility and we are laser focused on methodically executing our contracts, while the Technical Solutions business is positioned to capture growth opportunities. We remain extremely pleased with the technology, capability, talent and solutions that Alion has brought to the HII family. Now shifting the activities in Washington for a moment. We are pleased with the passage and enactment of the fiscal year 2022 Defense Authorization Bill and its strong support for shipbuilding. However, more than one quarter into the fiscal year, congressional appropriations have yet to be finalized and the federal government continues to operate under a continuing resolution through February 18. It remains uncertain at this point when annual funding measures will be finalized and we continue to urge Congress to proceed expeditiously. We do remain optimistic that the appropriations process will be completed in the weeks ahead. Now before I close, let me take a moment to address the recent announcement that, at my recommendation, our Board of Directors elected Chris Kastner to the role of President and CEO effective March 1. This is consistent with the company's succession plan and I fully endorse this transition. I truly believe this is a fantastic development for HII. As the Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, I will remain an HII employee through the rest of the year and will be able to support Chris and the Board. As the first CEO of this great company, I can tell you confidently that there is no better choice than Chris to lead HII into this bright new chapter, where I believe we are positioned better than ever before to successfully leverage our substantial backlog to generate strong free cash flow, demonstrate growth in our Technical Solutions division and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. And now, I will turn the call over to Chris for his remarks on the operations. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. Let me first congratulate Mike on his transition to Executive Vice Chairman of the Board and thank him on behalf of myself and our 44,000 employees for his extraordinary leadership. I also want to thank the Board of Directors for electing me to succeed Mike as HII's next CEO. Thanks to Mike's vision, HII is positioned well today and the value creation opportunity in front of us is as strong as ever. I'm honored to lead HII in its next chapter. Now shifting to our results. I'm very pleased to report another solid operational quarter. Let me share a few highlights. At Ingalls, the Navy continues to fund advanced procurement for amphibious patrol ship. LHA 9 and LHA 8 Bougainville is achieving cost and schedule performance in line with our expectations. On the DDG program, the team delivered guided missile destroyer DDG 121, Frank E. Petersen Jr. to the Navy and began fabrication of DDG 131, George M. Neil. This seal production line continues to positive momentum in 2022, with planned delivery of DDG 123 Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee. On the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale, has completed sea trials and is on track for delivery to the Navy in the first quarter of this year. In addition, LPD 29, Richard M. McCool, Jr, was launched in early January. We continue to watch the upcoming budget release for advanced procurement funding for LTD 32 to maintain the benefits of the serial production on LPDs. At Newport News, the Ford-class aircraft carriers are progressing well. CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 83% complete and the team is focused on compartment completion and key propulsion plant milestones. Later this year, Kennedy will begin testing of EMOLS, the electromagnetic launch system. CVN 80 Enterprise and CVN 81 Doris Miller continue material procurement and early unit construction and TVN 80 plans to lay Teal this year. On the RCOH program, CVN 73 USS George Washington reached 94% complete and is focused on propulsion plant testing and is planned for redelivery later this year. Regarding CVN 78 USS Gerald R. Ford, the planned incremental availability is on track to complete this year to support the Navy's first deployment of this critical asset. On the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana completed work as planned in Q4 2021 and will complete sea trials and delivery in Q1 2022. SSN 796 New Jersey was christened last year and is expected to achieve its float-off milestone early this year. While we did not achieve our projected end-of-year milestones, the VCS program continues to improve its progress towards a consistent 2 per year cadence. And finally, on a submarine fleet support program, SSN 725 Helena recently completed sea trials and was redelivered to the Navy last month. This Los Angeles class submarine maintenance completion marks the first redelivery from Newport News of a submarine following a major availability since 2009 and demonstrates the successful reconstitution of our submarine maintenance capability in support of the Navy. At Technical Solutions, the Alion integration is progressing on plan. Our organizations are already operating as a consolidated business. Back-office systems integration is in full swing and should be largely complete by the end of the year. Book-to-bill for 2021 was healthy at $1.1 million and the new business qualified pipeline is very robust at over $20 billion, a level strong enough to support our growth expectations for this business. Moreover, the velocity of the pipeline has already increased significantly entering 2022, with nearly $5 billion currently in evaluation or in proposal development. This includes multiple opportunities over $1 billion in total contract value that are expected to move to award this year. Before I close, I want to provide some remarks regarding our labor and material availability. We continue to keep COVID-19 impacts as watch items and are focused on ensuring our supply chain and labor supply will be able to continue to support our performance. Given the nation's overall labor pressures, we have increased attention with regard to hiring and attrition rates and we have detailed plans in place to accelerate hiring for 2022. We are leveraging targeted hiring events and actively utilizing our world-class apprentice schools as well as relationships with community colleges and high schools to increase the pace of talent acquisition and development. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on the financials. Tom?
Tom Steely: Thanks, Chris and good morning. Today, I'll briefly review our fourth quarter and full year results and also provide our outlook for 2022. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated fourth quarter results on Slide 5 of the presentation. Our fourth quarter revenues of $2.7 billion decreased approximately 3% compared to the same period last year. This was due to a decline at Newport News and Ingalls shipbuilding which was largely driven by very high level of material volume in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by the growth at Technical Solutions from the acquisition of Alion in the third quarter of this year. Operating income for the quarter of $120 million decreased by $185 million from the fourth quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 4.5% decreased 658 basis points. These decreases were largely due to a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment compared to the prior year as well as lower segment operating income driven by lower risk retirement on the DDG and NSC programs at Ingalls as well as lower risk retirement on submarine fleet support at Newport News. Moving to our consolidated results for the full year on Slide 6. Revenues were $9.5 billion for the year, an increase of 1.7% from 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Alion in the third quarter as well as growth at Newport News shipbuilding in the Virginia class and Columbia class submarine programs and carrier construction and overhaul. This was partially offset by a decline in revenue at Ingalls due to lower volumes on NSE and amphibious assault ships programs as well as the divestiture of our oil and gas business and the contribution of the San Diego shipyard to a joint venture early in 2021. On an organic basis, revenue for Technical Solutions was essentially flat year-over-year. Operating income for the year was $513 million and operating margin was 5.4%. This compares to operating income of $799 million and operating margin of 8.5% in 2020. The decreases were due to a less sale operating FAS/CAS adjustment compared to 2020, partially offset by stronger segment operating results. Segment operating income for the year was $683 million and segment operating margin was 7.2%. This compares to segment operating income of $555 million and segment operating margin of 5.9% in 2020. Our effective income tax rate was 18.4% for the quarter and 12.5% for the full year. This compares to 17.8% and 14.1% for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, respectively. The decrease in the annual tax rate was primarily due to additional research and development tax credit for tax years 2016 through 2020 recorded in the third quarter of 2021. Net earnings in 2021 were $544 million compared to $696 million in 2020. Diluted earnings per share in 2021 was $13.50 compared to $17.14 in the prior year. Pension adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2021 were $13.03, an increase of 30% from 2020 results due to stronger segment operating performance. 2021 results included approximately $20 million of pretax transaction and financing expenses related to the acquisition of Alion. Additionally, 2021 results include amortization of purchased intangible assets totaling approximately $86 million, of which approximately $33 million was related to Alion. Turning to cash flow on Slide 7 of the presentation. We ended 2021 with a cash balance of $627 million, up from $512 million at the end of 2020. Cash from operations was $271 million in the fourth quarter and free cash flow was $165 million. For the full year, cash from operations was $760 million and free cash flow was $449 million. Net capital expenditures in 2021 were $311 million or 3.3% of revenues. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $106 million in 2021. During the fourth quarter, we paid dividends of $1.18 per share or $48 million, bringing total dividends paid for the year to $186 million. We also repurchased approximately 75,000 shares during the quarter at an aggregate cost of approximately $14 million. In 2021, we repurchased approximately 544,000 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $101 million. On Slide 8, we have provided our updated 5-year pension outlook. The notable change from our prior outlook is the increase in the FAS benefit. This was largely driven by asset returns in 2021 of 12.7% and, to a lesser extent, the modest change in the discount rate. Moving on to Slide 9. We have provided details on our outlook for 2022. While we continue to expect shipbuilding growth of approximately 3% over time, our 2022 outlook range of $8.2 billion to $8.5 billion acknowledges uncertainties around the current environment. We finished 2021 with shipbuilding operating margins at 7.7%, the high end of our initial guidance range and at the midpoint of our revised guidance range. This was a marked improvement from the shipbuilding margin of 6.2% in 2020. We expect shipbuilding operating margin to be between 8% and 8.1% for 2022 and we expect 2023 shipbuilding operating margin will continue to improve beyond 2022 results. For Technical Solutions, we expect revenue of approximately $2.6 billion in 2022, operating margins of approximately 2.5% and EBITDA margin between 8% and 8.5%. These are all consistent with our guidance and messaging at the time of the Alion announcement and current run rate in 2021 results firmly support our expectations. In 2022, amortization of purchased intangible assets is expected to total approximately $142 million, of which $121 million is attributable to Technical Solutions. Given the timing of the shipbuilding program milestones and the normal seasonality for Technical Solutions, we expect the first quarter segment operating results to be the weakest of the year, with shipbuilding operating margin near 7% and Technical Solutions operating margin near 1%. Additionally, we expect that the first quarter 2022 shipbuilding revenue will be the lightest of the year given Omicron and the challenging labor market driving to a slow start of the year. Our expectation is for shipbuilding revenue to be approximately $100 million lower than results in the first quarter of 2021, with that equally split between the shipyards. Moving on, we expect 2022 capital expenditures to be between 2.5% and 3% of sales. This guidance does include modest incremental capital expenditures above our prior guidance related to investments in infrastructure and tooling to support the submarine industrial base. We are working with our Navy partner regarding the shared investment and capital incentive structure and believe these critical investments will have minimal impact on our overall free cash flow generation. We expect 2022 free cash flow to be between $300 million and $350 million which includes a number of nonrecurring items. First, as we noted on the third quarter call, we now expect the repayment of the advanced progress payments we received in 2020 to occur in 2022 which totals approximately $160 million. Additionally, we have a repayment of approximately $70 million in 2022 due to the 2020 payroll tax holiday. Our 2021 free cash flow results were also about $125 million better than the midpoint of our latest guidance, simply due to timing of collections and distributions. The outlook we are providing today is based on the best information we have now and assumes no further degradation in our supply chain. It also assumes that we're able to continue to hire employees at a pace that supports our staffing and that we continue to see limited impacts from inflation given the nature of our contracts and the long-term arrangements that we have in place with our labor unions and suppliers. Additionally, on Slide 9, we've provided our updated outlook for a number of other discrete items to assist you with your modeling. Regarding our longer-term targets, we remain confident in our free cash flow target of $3.2 billion from 2020 through 2024. This outlook does assume the continued expensing of research and development costs for tax purposes. For context, we now believe the impact to 2022 free cash flow would be approximately $100 million if the current R&D amortization treatment remains in place. On Slide 10, we have provided a walk up from our 2022 to 2024 free cash flow outlook. First, 2023 free cash flow is enhanced by the lack of discrete headwinds I just mentioned for 2022, the advance to progress and payroll tax holiday repayments. Secondly, we do expect a working capital tailwind in 2023 that, along with continued top line growth in shipbuilding, is expected to drive approximately $200 million of incremental cash flow. Finally, the growth in margin expansion of Technical Solutions is expected to contribute meaningful incremental free cash flow in 2023 and beyond. As a reminder, working capital can be quite lumpy as we saw at the end of 2021 and we have provided ranges to help account for that variability. For 2023, we are expecting free cash flow to be between $750 million and $800 million and between $800 million and $900 million for 2024 which is all consistent with the target of $3.2 billion between 2020 and 2024. In closing, given the persistent challenges presented in 2021, we are pleased that we were able to complete the year with the results generally consistent with our guidance, including shipbuilding margin at the high end of our initial range and free cash flow well above our guidance. Notwithstanding the current environment, we remain enthusiastic regarding our long-term outlook as we begin 2022, with nearly $50 billion in backlog and Technical Solutions business that we believe is poised with very strong growth. We are laser-focused on consistent execution and generating sustainable long-term value. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Christie for Q&A.
Christie Thomas: Thanks, Tom. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator:  And the first question will be from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Hi, good morning. So I was wondering if we can focus on cash flow for just a second and beyond '23, '24, just the algorithm and the conversion ratios that you think about as being sustainable. Obviously, in '23, '24, you're converting well above, I think, what's implied non -- after you adjust for pension, noncash pension income, you're converting well above 100%. So maybe just tell us about what the conversion structure or equation should be after '24.
Tom Steely: Sure. Thanks, Myles. I'll take that. Tom here. Sure. So as we've been kind of guiding and as we get into the out year this year, the portfolio is maturing. The ships are getting deeper into their build cycles. We're getting deeper into prime. We're seeing -- and we're getting more ships as we've highlighted in the past in deliveries into '22, '23, '24 time frame from where we've come from. So we're seeing additional progressing and improvement in working capital in the out years and then a higher conversion rate as we released retentions and run through the deliveries of those ships. So, I'm with you that there's a couple of years that we're playing catch-up actually and the bridge I've given here in half of Page 10 actually kind of shows that there's some headwinds that we have in working capital exiting '21 going into '22. The working capital actually gets a little bit worse. And on the top end of our range, almost 8% in the high 7s. But then as we get into '23 and out, we actually see that turn back and become favorable for cash and cash contribution as we work off the progress of the ships and we deliver the ships there.
Myles Walton: But we shouldn't assume any substantive drop off post '24 from working capital materials on the opposite direction.
Tom Steely: No. No, I think what we've highlighted, long term, I mean, as we work the ships off, have the collections and then deliver, the margin and free cash flow will gravitate into a one-off. You'll see years where there's some pressure on that as the maturity of the enterprise as a whole is on the front end of the cycle. And then as we kind of move a little bit more on the back end of the cycle, we've accumulated this backlog of $48 billion. And now that we're kind of heavy in the ramp-up of pushing that work through the state here, hiring up and then achieving the progress, you'll see that swing backwards to favorability both in 2023 and 2024.
Chris Kastner: Myles, it's Chris. I think you're getting into a new normal from a free cash flow generation standpoint up at those elevated levels. So it just naturally gets there.
Myles Walton: Okay. And congratulations, Chris and Mike. Thanks, again.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Myles.
Operator: And the next question will be from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Good morning, thank you. First, Mike, I just want to wish you all the best in this transition. It's been great working with you even from before there was an HII, so it's been a pretty exciting road, I think.
Mike Petters: Thanks, Doug.
Doug Harned: The question I've got is, you all talked a lot about a 3% top line growth rate which is pretty consistent when we model out where the ship by ship things should go. But if I look at the 2022 guidance, there's really negligible growth versus your shipbuilding revenues in 2020. And so is this consistent with your expectations? And can you break it down between Ingalls, Newport News and also the impact of services?
Mike Petters: Sure. I'll take that. I appreciate that. Thanks, Doug. So yes, we gave some color on how 2020 finished out against 2019. And when you look at each year, specifically depending on how that material and labor hits at the quarter close of each year, it can sway how the trend line looks. If you think about the shipbuilding we finished off 2019, just on the $7.8 billion, we had thought 2020 would be about $8 billion but we had a strong, strong fourth quarter in 2020. We actually closed out in shipbuilding at $8.250 billion, $8.25 billion in that. So that was almost a 6% year increase on that. So that material kind of slid in a little bit earlier than we thought it was going to be in '21 to '20. So the trend line that we have here is at $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion. And then last year, although we highlight a 3% medium to long term, with the movement just kind of accelerating into the 2020 time frame that have shrunk a couple of hundred million dollars out of 2021. We did see pressures because of both Delta and Omicron at the end of 2021 which kind of pushed down. We saw -- although Newport News was a slight growth outlook, about $50 million in air sales. Ingalls was up about $150 million under and that was primarily driven either from a planning perspective, things were accelerated on the material side and some pressures on the labor on the back end. So it is true that if you look at 2020 and 2021, you're looking at $8.250 billion and then at $8.191 billion. We actually backed up $50 million in shipbuilding itself for 2021. Now relative to the range and your question of $8.2 billion to $8.5 billion, we're seeing right now problems with the virus and Omicron lightening right now. The case rates are going down at a quick pace at the beginning of this year. And if that sustains itself and we have a normal run rate year in 2020 and then '21 were both impacted with the virus in case rates. But if we see a normal year right here, we still think that $8.5 billion for shipbuilding which is a clean over 3.5%. -- clean 3% on the actual would be about at $8.436 billion. So that's why we've given you a range of $8.2 billion to $8.5 billion. I think $8.5 billion is a clean year. And for some reason COVID runs through the entire year or there's another variant, we could still see another flat year. The pressure would manifest itself on the labor side, right? So we do see some disruption at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. On the labor side, we have hiring plans. We know how to go do that. Our human capital is the most important resource that we have. So we've been successful over the years in being able to establish our labor plan, hire, train, retain. And we just got to put our head down and that could happen this year. I do believe that the pressures that we see in my opening notes in Q1 that we see at the beginning of the first quarter, Q1 was going to be a low quarter anyway and then a little bit light because of the labor are recoverable this year as well in both perspective. If you're concerned about that, if you strike the line and we always say, it's lumpy, whether it's cash or even on the revenue side. So you can kind of look at it from quarter-to-quarter EBIT from 1 year to another year stuff. But if you look at from 2017 using that as the base of shipbuilding at $6.6 billion, the CAGR on that over 4 years is 5.5%. If you use 2018 as the base, the CAGR on that is 3.7%. And even using these 2 years where we had an acceleration in 2020 and then a little flatness in 2021 because of COVID is a 2.4% CAGR. So I mean, we're being transparent in the notes that although we believe that shipbuilding is still 3%. And as I said, over the last 4 years, it's 5.5%, the last 3 years, it's 3.7%. But we believe it's sustainable that we can get 3% long term. We moderated just slightly and did guide to a range of $8.2 billion to $8.5 billion.
Doug Harned: And just related to this on timing. So you talked about 2021 and one of the things that helped you -- that you reported helping you in margins in Newport News was performance on Virginia class. Now you're going through this Block 4 to Block 5 transition. General Dynamics reported that they were seeing delays in modules and some supply chain issues right now. I mean when you're looking at 2022, are you seeing any issues there in terms of this overall program and how you do the transition from Block 4 to Block 5?
Chris Kastner: Yes. No. Doug, this is Chris. Actually, it's pretty encouraging from a module standpoint in Newport News last year. They met their commitment on module, so they're getting some stability in the manufacturing organization in Newport News. So it's pretty stable. Missed the milestones at the end of the year related to Montana and New Jersey but those will happen here momentarily. But they're pressing towards getting back to a 2-tier cadence; the team is very focused on it.
Doug Harned: Okay. Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will be from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Could you walk through the growth in Technical Services? Because it looks like if you look at the guide that you guys are implying, it implies organic growth in the core. If you pick out a line, it was actually pretty darn good. I mean it seems like we had organic growth that might have been mid-teens or higher in the business without Alion. And how do we think about that? And what are the growth drivers for that business as we go into '22?
Tom Steely: So Ron, it's Tom here. And consistent with the notes I gave you, actually, if you pull a line out, the organic growth year-over-year was flat. So we can walk you through that on the side if, for some reason, you see something that's driving a different way on that. We did have some pressures unmanned, although we feel positive about that business and we've highlighted that we think that's going help. Although the budget is smaller right now. We think that's going to be a high-growth area on the Navy side of the budget, probably fast-growing if there's any account that they have there. We did see that the appropriations and the awards were delayed and we've been foreshadowing that, that's going to be pushed out to the summer into the full time frame in 2022. So that actually stymied the organic side of TSD. From Alion perspective, though and you can work yourself through the -- in the K through the pro forma information that we gave, they actually had a stellar year last year from a growth perspective. They were up 23% from 2020 to 2021. And consistent with what we've highlighted at '18, '19, '20, they were in the teens from a growth perspective. We've incorporated that into our TSD $1 billion business. And within the $2.6 billion, we feel comfortable about the growth rates that we've been highlighting there from 7% to 9% for at least 2024. So also, as I noted in my opening comments, whether it was in Q3 for the first 9 weeks or through Q4 and Q3, Q4, the run rates have been consistent. They've been slightly kind of moving out there where we thought they would be to date. And as I've highlighted with the actuals at $507 million, with that run rate itself, it needs about 11% growth to kind of make the $1.6 billion of the $2.6 billion that we're highlighting for TSD division for 2022. So very comfortable with Alion to date, although you're always good at your next bid and win, so they have to go do that. And then from the other side, Andy Green has restructured his business over there. He's got his leaders aligned. He's getting some synergy of combining the leadership and resources with the organic TSD. And we're watching closely how unmanned unfolds to see the growth in that area.
Chris Kastner: Ron, from a market standpoint, I mentioned some significant opportunities that we have bid on and will bid on in the first part of the year. I don't want to comment on the specific items because they're competitive but there -- it's broadly across ISR, advanced training, cyber-intel. And then we have unmanned opportunities that were delayed from last year that will come out this year. So it's pretty broad within growth markets that Alion and the legacy TSD are engaged in.
Ron Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then maybe just as a follow-on. Can you speak a little bit to the CapEx investment you're making? Is that prepped for maybe more Virginia class? Or I mean, how do we think about that?
Tom Steely: Yes. So from the previous quarters, we were kind of highlighting that, that was a possibility there, much as we've seen the CapEx come down from 3.6% in 2020. And last year, it finished up at 3.3%. We're guiding to about 2.5%. More recently, because of our taking a look at -- we're evaluating both the current submarine requirements as well as future anticipated awards that are coming down on Block VI -- Block V, Block VI, the Columbia class follow-on, we're in discussions with our Navy customer on these requirements. And there is a need for additional investments for the submarine industrial rates, specifically infrastructure and some tooling. We would partner with the Navy on that investment. And with capital incentives, we would be moderately increasing our CapEx to now the forecasted range of 2.5% to 3% and that would run out over the next several years. Again, we would only go forward with the customer assistance. And to be clear, we'd only move forward if the investment made sense and we just had an appropriate return against it. This is a minor change that we've incorporated into the business plan but it is considered in the forecast of the $3.2 billion free cash flow, the generation through 2024 that we've reconfirmed.
Mike Petters: Yes. Ron, it's also consistent with the 2 per year, plus the next phase of the Columbia class. If they were to accelerate to 3, then there'd be initial investment that would be required.
Ron Epstein: And my congratulations on the transition. For Doug's remark, it's been nice working with you over the years.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Hi, good morning. Mike and Chris, congrats. It has been an excellent run working with you, Mike. I'd Like to ask Chris if you could talk a little bit about labor. What do you expect net headcount to be or growth to be in '22, the pieces of that, so departures, additions and how we think about cost within that and how the new collective bargaining agreement with might affect that.
Chris Kastner: Yes, that's a good question. There's some -- some really -- some positive indicators related to Omicron where we're cautiously optimistic. We only had 20 outs in Newport News or 20 folks that had the virus earlier this week and attendance is improving and that's half the battle. So getting the attendance back to stability, we have a predictable labor force to execute on the program. So it was really nirvana for a shipbuilder. So that's half the battle. The other half is we need to hire north of 5,000 people. So I don't want to get into attrition and splitting it by the shipyards. But we're pretty good at building a workforce relationships with our apprentice schools, community college, high schools. We think we can meet that commitment. It's going to be a challenge but we think we can build that workforce in order to achieve our sales guidance.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then just a quick one for Tom. If you could run through the details on EACs in the quarter.
Tom Steely: Sure. So for Q4, we saw a net of $10 million favorability, $45 million favorable and $35 million unfavorable. And the net debt of the $10 million was basically attributable to a split between Ingalls and TSD.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Mike Maugeri: Hey, good morning. Thank you, guys. And Mike and Chris, congratulations to both of you. Chris, following on Doug's question, can you add a little bit more color around the transition between Virginia Class Block IV and Block V as you close out the year, risk items you're keeping an eye on that happened to Block IV, where you're sort of expecting for Block V and whether there could be upside there?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So remember, we did take a charge on Block IV. So there could potentially be some upside in Block V. The team is very focused on early module fabrication. We met our commitments this year in that regard. And the best thing about kind of the rhythm we're getting there on the VCS program is you're training a team, right? And you're training a team to deliver one afloat off one every year. That team is going to roll right on to Block V. So if we can get predictable performance, that's really the place you want to be in shipbuilding with -- in serial production. So we just need to keep the positive momentum going.
Mike Maugeri: Got it. And then a related follow-up. How does the mix between Block IV and Block V trend over the next 3, 4 years, 3 years, probably?
Chris Kastner: We don't have that specific information for you. We don't really provide guidance at that level. But deliveries on Block IV happen 1 a year for the next 3 years after we get through Montana and then we'll transition. So it will slowly evolve into more Block V revenue.
Mike Maugeri: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning, and congratulations to Mike and Chris. Just wanted to start off asking a little bit about the cash flow bridge and just kind of understanding the piece that's in '23, I think, the $200 million of shipbuilding growth at working capital. Just when we think about shipbuilding growth and we think about a 3% top line with a shipbuilding margin type drop-through after tax, that would imply that the vast, vast majority of that $200 million is working capital. So, I just want to confirm that that's kind of the right thing about it. And then when we think about what drives the growth from '23 to '24, is it a similar dynamic where there's that level of underlying EBITDA growth from the shipyards on that kind of 3% and then anything else is kind of working capital as you go to '24?
Tom Steely: So yes, thanks. I appreciate the question. It's Tom here. So yes, from the working capital perspective, you are right. The bar there shows $200 million, so there is a lift there both in the volume and then the expected returns from the $7.7 billion drop that we gave you for shipbuilding. It's now the range that we have here. So you can do the quick math of that and it's about 1/4 of that, although -- for that. The rest is either in working capital which is the preponderance of it. And there is a piece, even though the CapEx is not at the 2.5% but 2.5% to 3% on the low end of the range, there is a little bit of a push there. We did put it on the chart kind of going forward. The CapEx could be $10 million to $20 million on a run rate cheaper going forward on that. The working capital itself, the way I kind of look at that, as I mentioned, is we see a drag from the working capital leaving '21 going into '22 by about $100 million in additional working capital. And then that reverses itself to over $300 million. I mean it's both the bar there as well as what's kind of sitting in the advanced progress and the FICA repayments, that's a give back there, too. And that comes about through both contracts -- working capital that we have as well as the trade working capital. So, you can work yourself through that. It does improve, as I said, significantly from '22 to '23 and we find the sums going from the top end of the range in '22 of the 6% to 8%. So actually, with cap incentives, it actually kind of gets us even below the bottom end of that 6% range in '23 with a slight improvement going forward in '24.
Seth Seifman: Okay. And then just wanted to follow up quickly on the hiring. The 5,000 people, how does that compare to other years recently in terms of -- I guess that's the number of gross adds. Because just looking at it as a percentage of the shipbuilding workforce, it seems like it's pretty high. It's probably about 14% of the shipbuilding workforce.
Mike Petters: Seth, we're pretty good at hiring people. We hired that -- almost that much last year; we'll actually hire north of that this year. So yes, we're pretty good at this; it's -- we -- my boss considers it a core competency and so do I.
Seth Seifman: Great. Okay. Thanks very much, guys.
Operator: The next question will come from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Great, thanks. And let me echo my congratulations to you both as well.
Mike Petters: Thanks, David.
David Strauss: Just want to ask about the shipbuilding margin profile. So you're calling for a couple, I guess, 40 bps -- 40, 50 bps of improvement. Can you talk or give some color how that might break out amongst the shipyards? I mean we've been on a trend here where Newport News has been coming up. Ingalls has been trending down. So how does that look, I guess, in '22 and then for the additional progress you're expecting beyond '22?
Tom Steely: Yes. So to date, we give our outlook against the enterprises, so we don't kind of break that up between both Ingalls or Newport News. As I kind of mentioned earlier a little bit, it is the ships that we have in the contract, working them through the EAP processes, the registers burning down risk. As we get deeper into the build cycle, the additional progress, payments clause allows us to have more collections. And with the bringing down on risk, we'll have high booking rates as we get into more deliveries in the out years. So I mean, that's the essence of it.
Mike Petters: Yes. I will say, David, just I agree with Tom that it's really the maturity of the ships that Newport news are going to drive a lot of that earnings growth.
David Strauss: Okay, got it. And Chris, maybe if you could touch on the unmanned portfolio. I think you highlighted it as a bit of a risk item last quarter. And I guess, you also highlighted in the release today, the dragged on TS margin, just an update on what you're seeing there.
Chris Kastner: Yes. Yes. Some progress there, small and medium, we think will both be awarded late Q1, early Q2, really after the budget is agreed upon. So we'll know a lot more after small and medium size are awarded. We're making good progress on XL. We shipped our first modules to Boeing, so it's critically important we get that ship -- or that boat -- or Boeing gets that boat in the water to start demonstrating its capability. So, reasonable progress in unmanned and we'll know a lot more this year.
David Strauss: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: And the next question is from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Yes, good morning, guys. And I'll reiterate, Mike, best of luck, and Chris, congrats. I want to talk about aircraft carriers. It looks like work on the Ford elevators is finally finished up and ships getting closer to deployment. And I just saw on your slides the statement of work, I think, on the Kennedy is now done. Can you talk about maybe what you've learned about the technical risk on the Ford class and how that's going to apply to the Kennedy? And do you have that contract mod yet on the Kennedy? That's it.
Mike Petters: Yes. We do have the mod on the Kennedy. I got an old aircraft carrier program manager here that hasn't answered a question, so I'm curious if he wants to jump in here on the aircraft carriers, then I'll jump in after.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks. It's Chris . So I think the first part of your question is what do we learn from Ford that's going to go through the rest of the class. And I think, over the time we've talked about it, we've pointed out that the first ship in our production run is also a prototype where we have to test out the manning plans, the design, the supply chains, the construction plans, all those things get tested. We then came off of that, just to kind of set you, on how we did this. We came off of that with a plan to invest capital. We invested about $250 million in capital. We reduced the price of the Kennedy by about $1 billion based on that and that was really driven by learning curves. We went to the government and said, okay. We have now figured out how to efficiently build this ship, understanding the supply chains and understanding the manning and the technology and all that sort of stuff and the learning curves. The next thing we need to do is we need to buy these things smarter. And so the government worked with us and we came up with a 2-ship buy for 80 and 81. I think that where we are right now is the weapons elevators on Ford are behind us. The ship is accelerating towards delivery from its last availability with us post-shock trials and it's accelerating towards its first deployment. I think you're going to see the ship out there carrying the flag and doing great things. In the meantime, we've got the modification for Kennedy to go forward. We've taken all of the lessons that we've learned from Ford. We've invested against those lessons to drive success on Kennedy. And as I think Chris pointed out, the fabrication and work that we're already doing on the Enterprise after that and then Dory Miller after that, I mean, you're talking about a 4-ship program here that's going to be very mature and hot and running really well. And I think it's going to put the -- put our customer in a place where they can think seriously about how do we extend this program and move forward. And my focus would be at this point is how do we take all of this in a package and start talking about 82 and 83. I think that's where we need to be going with the program. I think it's positioned very well to do that. We're through the growing pains now and we're ready to accelerate into efficient production. I'm excited about the future of the program and it is a tremendous ship.
Pete Skibitski: That's great. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question will be from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Gautam Khanna: Hey, good morning, guys. And congratulations, Mike and Chris.
Mike Petters: Thanks, Gautam.
Gautam Khanna: By the way it's sad now we are . Anyways, I just wanted to…
Mike Petters: You'll be okay. I'm sure. .
Gautam Khanna: No, no insult meant there. I just -- it's been a long time. I was going to ask about the guidance on shipbuilding margin, first of all, I mean, it seems extraordinarily precise, 8% to 8.1%. It's a tighter range than you've given in the past. And I was curious what informs that conviction around a 10 basis point swing? And given the soft Q1 start, I mean, is there any waiting you could tell us? Like Q4 has got a ton of human catch-ups or risk retirement opportunities or what have you. Like just if you could kind of give us a sense for why the precision. And when do we get those lumpy human catch-up opportunities later in the year?
Tom Steely: Sure. Yes, it is a more precise range than we gave last year. Last year, we started out at 7% to 8% and then we narrowed that in Q3 to 7.5% to 8% and it came in at 7.7%. And although that range was probably a safe -- a conservative range, we went up on the top end of that range. We did see -- foresee that, that could happen but we wanted to see that the play out with COVID. So that was why we did that. I think going into 2022, we didn't want to give a really wide range. We felt we'd be a little bit more transparent where we think the year is going to land. We feel comfortable that from where we exited at 7.7% for shipbuilding, we know the work we're doing, the backlog that's coming on board which isn't really going to influence 2022 that much. But the work we're doing, the serial production, the lessons learned that Mike and Chris have talked about, we feel strong about that kind of going forward. The -- COVID could have an impact on the revenue but the cost efficiency and how we're operating right now, we feel good about and we think that this is going to be a lift. We've been guiding that we're going to march our way back up and we think that's still in sight here right now. The portfolio mix, as we've said on, what we take it behind us on DCS in the mix, so that's going to slow the march back but it's still the march back up for high of -- from where we thought we'd be. So we feel good about it right now. As we work -- as we get into the year and work down the risk, we'll see that we'll realize that, right? Now specifically, what we see happening here is with more deliveries in '22, '23 and '24 than where we came from in '18, '19, '20, with the ships as we're building them with the lessons learned in serial production and there are a couple of ships in the next year or so uniquely contracted and higher incentives, I think of like DDG-125, for example, that was a modified plateau. We incorporated in ECP a unique -- uniquely how we contracted that with incentives on the schedule side of it. So there's a couple of nuances in the ships that we believe are going to be -- provide additional margin, say, than a normal ship. But we have line of sight of that right now and we feel comfortable on that outlook of 8% to 8.1%.
Gautam Khanna: And your point is it sequentially builds through the year. So Q4 is greater than Q3, greater than Q2, etcetera, in terms of margin.
Tom Steely: We didn't provide that guidance. I would tell you, it's pretty flat. I mean, I think, obviously, Q1 is going to be light. And then from there, we'll see how it plays out. But after we get out of Q1, it's not a significant driver from quarter-to-quarter there.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And then just a follow up on...
Tom Steely: Margins is like -- it's not a quarter-to-quarter gain, right?
Gautam Khanna: Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then with Alion, I'm just curious. We've seen a lot of the government services contractors not have great results of late for whatever reason, whether it be COVID, whether it be bookings are soft because the government's not getting stuff awarded on time due to COVID or continuing resolution and the like. I'm just curious, like, what can you say about sort of the Alion book-to-bill in Q4? And you mentioned there were some contracts you're bidding on in the first half. How do you -- what do you expect for book-to-bill in Alion in '22?
Chris Kastner: So, we think -- this is Chris, Gautam. I think the book-to-bill will be north of 1 based on the significant opportunities we have there. If the CR extends too far into the year, there could be some pressure on the top line. But we're pretty comfortable. With our pipeline and the significant opportunities we're bidding on and the markets that we're in, we're pretty comfortable with Alion in Technical Solutions.
Gautam Khanna: And Q4 book-to-bill?
Chris Kastner: Yes. With south of that, I don't have that specific information in front of me. So Tom, if you have it, go ahead.
Tom Steely: So I know for the year, it's 1, 1.
Chris Kastner: 1, 1. Right.
Gautam Khanna: Thank you, guys.
Operator: The next question will be from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Could you comment on where the learning curve has been on the Kennedy that you're 89% done? I remember in the beginning, there was this big issue that you were going to have twice the learning curve that they may be is suggesting.
Mike Petters: Yes. So we don't have a specific learning curve on Kennedy at this point. We just figured -- extended the schedule for the single-phase delivery. They're heavily into the volume work on the ship. They're miles ahead in some systems and making really good progress. So I'm comfortable with where they're at financially but I don't have a specific learning curve for you right now, George.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then maybe one quick one for Tom. Given that New Jersey and Montana didn't meet the milestones in Q4, are they expected to meet them in Q1? And if so, why wouldn't the margin be a little better than the 7%?
Tom Steely: So they were planned happening last year. I will tell you, though, that just as we go over the goal line, some of the milestones don't specifically bring margin immediately. Depending on where we finished in the quarter, there's an EAC and hot wash that we do and it could be both a subsequent fourth quarter. Even though they will bring a couple of dollars that goes into the mix against the portfolio. So when you really -- out of all the math, you're not going to see a big drive in one specific quarter like that. But it is a slight lift and that's probably at more accretive. So the 7.7% last year without them coming into this year bolsters our outlook and our perspective on what 8% to 8.1% looks good.
Chris Kastner: Remember, George, those are Block IV boats and we did take a charge on those. So the opportunity for risk retirement is reduced.
George Shapiro: Okay, thanks. And congratulations, Chris. And lots of luck to you, Mike.
Mike Petters: Thanks, George.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, George.
Operator: Thank you. I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Petters for any closing remarks.
Mike Petters: This is my last earning call. I just want to take the opportunity to say thank you, again, to all of the folks that I've had the opportunity to work alongside with the last 35 years. It's been a privilege for me to serve as CEO of this company for so many years and I frankly have enjoyed working with each and every one of you in the financial community, in the business, in our customer set. And I do appreciate your research and thoughtful questions, even if I didn't say so at the time. I've learned a lot. I would hope that maybe you've learned a little along the way. But as we look forward and as you can tell by today's call, our company is in very good hands with Chris and the senior leadership team. And I am confident that HII has a very bright, bright future. Thanks for joining us on today's call. I hope that you and your families continue to stay safe and healthy. We appreciate your time and your continuing interest in our company. Thank you very much.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike.
Mike Petters: Thanks Dwayne. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, we released third quarter 2021 financial results that included another quarter of consistent shipbuilding program execution. Let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.3 billion were up 1% from the third quarter of 2020 and diluted EPS was $3.65 down from $5.45 in the third quarter of 2020. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $600 million, resulting in backlog of approximately $50 billion at the end of the quarter, of which approximately $24 billion is funded. Shipping to activities in Washington, the federal government began the new fiscal year under a continuing resolution, which funds government operations through December 3.  And we continue to urge Congress to proceed expeditiously and remain optimistic that the defense appropriations and authorization processes will be completed in the months ahead. As bill's progress through both chambers of Congress, we continue to see bipartisan support for our programs reflected in the defense appropriations and authorization bills in the House and the Senate. We're pleased that the 4 defense oversight committees have shown strong support for shipbuilding to include adding a second, Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, which is a navy -- a top navy priority for fiscal year 2022.  The appropriations bill also include language in support of a DDG 51 follow-on multi-year procurement contract in FY23. So, as I prepare to close, let me give a quick update on COVID-19. We continue to work with our customers to satisfy the requirement for federal contractors to have their workforce vaccinated against COVID-19 by December the 8 2021. At HII we remain committed to promoting and protecting the health and safety of our employees, their families, and their communities, and continuing to serve our customers and the vital national security interest of our country without disruption as an essential contributor to the nation's critical infrastructure.  We view our workforce of approximately 44,000 employees as critical partners in this effort and continue to help our unvaccinated employees meet this requirement as safely and efficiently as possible. We will continue to evaluate how the vaccine mandate and Delta variant impact our workforce as well as material availability from our supply chain and we expect to have more to share during the fourth quarter earnings call in February. And finally, let me recap what HII has done from a portfolio shaping perspective over the past 20 months. In short, we have done exactly what we said we would do during our February 2020 Investor Day.  First, we have positioned the Technical Solutions business in growth markets that support the constantly evolving requirements of our customers. And second, we have demonstrated the financial flexibility to pursue these critical growth opportunities while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings and continuing to return capital to shareholders.  And following the closing of the aligned transaction during the quarter, our team is laser-focused on a successfully integration in order to produce the financial returns we expect, we're also ensuring that our core ship building programs are achieving key production milestones in order to generate strong free cash flow, which will enable deleveraging of the balance sheet while continuing to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We firmly believe that these are the appropriate steps to generate significant long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. And now I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the operations. Chris.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report another solid operational quarter. With that, let me share a few highlights. At Ingalls, let me first provide a brief update on the pending contract awards LHA 9, LPD 32, and 33. We still believe that a bundled acquisition of these critically important shifts is the most cost-effective method of procurement and are pleased that the Navy and Congress have protected the shift schedules with a contract for long lead material on LHA 9 coupled with continued support for LPD 32 and 33, Shifting the program status, LHA 8 Bonneville (ph) continues to achieve cost and schedule performance in line with our expectations.  We're making steady progress through the structural erection and initial outfitting phases of construction. On the DDG program, the team successfully completed acceptance trials for guided missile destroyer DDG 121, Frank E Peterson Junior, and expects to deliver the shift to the Navy by the end of this year. In addition, DDGs 123 and 125 remain on track to complete sea trials next year as planned. On the LPD program, LPD 28, Fort Lauderdale was christened in August. This ship remains on track to complete sea trials during the fourth quarter with delivery to the Navy planned in the first quarter of next year. Our Newport News CVN-79, Kennedy is approximately 84% complete.  And the focus remains on compartment completion and key initial propulsion plant milestones. Regarding the sensitization of a single-phase delivery contract modification, we have reached agreement on a cost and schedule impacts with the Navy and expect to execute the contract modification late this year, or early next year. On the RCOH programs, CVN-73, USS George Washington continues to achieve key propulsion plant milestones and is approximately 92% complete. And CVN 78, USS Gerald Ford, returned to Newport News in August to begin a planned incremental availability. On the VCS program SSN 794, Montana remains on track for delivery to the Navy later this year.  And the SSN 796 New Jersey float up milestone has moved to early next year to ensure that we achieve the optimum build sequence from float off to delivery plan in 2022. And finally, on the submarine fleet support program, SSN 725, Helena remains on track for redelivery to the Navy later this year. At technical solutions to the Alion transaction closed in that August and the team announced new business groups and executive appointments that directly aligned with our strategic focus that we have previously articulated.  We expect this very talented team to execute a successful integration of Alion and deliver unparalleled national security solutions to our customers while growing the business and producing returns in line with our expectations. Delays in contract awards in our unmanned business for critical new programs remains a watch item. We're expecting this to be resolved by the end of the year but as a tier that these awards are not likely until early to mid-2022. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on the financials. Tom?
Tom Steely: Thanks, Chris and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our third quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for 2021. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website beginning with our consolidated results on Slide four of the presentation. Our third quarter revenues of 2.3 billion increased approximately 1% compared to the same period last year. This is due to growth at Technical Solutions driven by the Allied acquisition, which was largely offset by a decline in revenue at Ingalls primarily due to lower volumes on the NSC, DDG and HLA programs.  Segment operating income for the quarter of a $163 million increased $1 million comparison the third quarter of 2020 and segment operating margin of 7% was in line with the results from the prior-year period. Operating income for the quarter of a $118 million decreased by a $104 million from the third quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 5% decreased 455 basis points. These decreases were almost entirely due to a less favorable operating FAS CAS adjustment compared to the prior year period. The tax rate in the quarter was a negative 4.3% compared to 1.8% in the third quarter of 2020 to decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to additional research and development tax credits for tax years 2016 through 2020 recorded in the third quarter of 2021.  Net earnings in the quarter were 147 million compared to 222 million in the third quarter of 2020, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.65 compared to $5.45 in the prior-year period. Third quarter 2021 results include approximately $15 million of non-recurring pre -tax transaction expenses related to the acquisition of Alion. Excluding the impact of pension diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.50. compared to $3.73 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Turning to slide 5, cash from operations was 350 million in the quarter, and net capital expenditures were 73 million or 3.1% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of 277 million. This can pass to cash from operations of 222 million and 62 million of net capital expenditures or free cash flow of a 160 million in the prior-year period.  Cash contributions to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans were 10 million in the quarter principally related to post-retirement benefits. During the third quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or 46 million. Our Board of Directors recently approved a 3.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.18 per share. And this will take effect in the fourth quarter of this year. We also repurchased approximately 83,000 shares during the quarter at an aggregate cost of approximately $17 million. Moving onto Slide 6, Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $628 million decreased $47 million or 7% from the same period last year, driven primarily by lower revenues on the NSC, DDG, and LHA programs.  Ingalls operating income of $62 million and margin of 9.9% in the quarter, compared to operating income of $62 million and margin of 9.2% in the third quarter of 2020. The operating margin improvement was driven by an incentive on the DDG program and higher risk retirement for the LPD program, partially offset by lower risk retirement on the NSC program. Turning to Slide 7, Newport News revenues of approximately $1.4 billion in the quarter decreased $4 million or less than 1% from the same period last year, driven by lower revenues enabled Nucleus support services partially offset by higher revenues in submarines and aircraft carriers.  Naval Nucleus support services revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes in submarine fleet support services and facility maintenance services, partially offset by higher volumes in carrier fleet support services. Summering revenues increased due to higher volumes in block 5 boats of the Virginia class submarine program and submarine support services and Columbia class submarine program, partially offset by lower volumes on block 4 boats of the Virginia class submarine program. Aircraft carrier revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes on the RCOH of USS , CVN 74 and the construction of Doris Mellow CVN 81 and enterprise CVN 80, partially offset by lower volumes on RCOH of USS George Washington, CVN-73 and the construction of John F. Kennedy, CVN-79, Newport News operating income of $88 million and margin of 6.5% in the quarter compares to operating income of $79 million and margin of 5.8% in the third quarter of 2020.  The improvement was primarily due to higher risk retirement on the RCOH of the USS George Washington, CVN-73 and block 4 boats of the VCS program. Partially offset by lower risk retirement on the Naval Nuclear support services. Now the Technical Solutions on slide 8 of the presentation, Technical Solutions, revenues of $394 million in the quarter increased 23% from the same period last year, mainly due to revenue attributable to the acquisition of Alion in mid-August partially offset by the divestiture of our oil and gas business and contribution of the San Diego shipyard to a joint venture in the first quarter of this year.  The acquisition of Alion closed on August 19, and third-quarter results included approximately a $163 million of revenue attributable to align. Technical Solution's operating income of $13 million and operating margin of 3.3% in the quarter compares to an operating income of $21 million and operating margin of 6.6% in the third quarter of 2020 decreases were primarily driven by the inclusion of approximately $8 million of Alion related purchase in tangible amortization, as well as lower performance in Defense and federal solutions to divestiture of our oil and gas business.  And the contribution in the San Diego shipyards to a joint venture I previously mentioned. Third quarter of 2021 results included approximately $4 million of operating income attributable to Alion. Third quarter Technical Solution's EBITDA was approximate $30.3 million or an EBITDA margin of 7.7%. Moving onto slide 9 of the presentation, was updated our outlook for 2021 and 2022, pension and post-retirement benefits. For 2022, FAS is now projected to be a benefit rather than expense, primarily due to higher asset returns. Consequently, the FAS CAS adjustment has increased from the prior outlook and is now projected to total 52 million in 2022.  Please remember that pension-related numbers are subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria. We will provide a multiyear update of pension estimates on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. Finally, on Slide 10, a perspective on the outlook for the remainder of the year for both shipbuilding and technical solutions, inclusive of Alion. Regarding shipbuilding, we now expect 2021 revenue to be approximately $8.2 billion, at the low end but within our initial guidance range. Third quarter shipbuilding's revenue was modestly impacted by material timing, which may persist in the near-term.  Additionally, we continue to navigate through a challenging labor market, as well as the potential impacts of COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Given all of that, we think it's best to be prudent and  near-term expectations. We continue to expect that ship building operating margin will finish the year in the 7.5 to 8% range. We expect that the fourth quarter shipbuilding operating margin will be roughly consistent with the third quarter results as we were able to recognize some key retirement events in the third quarter, including the completion of sea trials for DDG 121.  Regarding Technical Solutions, I've noted that Alion acquisition closed in mid-August and our updated expectations for 2021 now include Alion from the date of acquisition, inclusive of incremental purchase intangible amortization that impacts our segment operating margin expectation. Turning to free cash flow, we now expect. 2021 free cash flow to be between three $300 million and $350 million as the repayment of the accelerated progress payments, which was initially expected in 2021, has now moved out to 2022.  Additionally, on Slide 10, we have provided an updated outlook for a number of other discrete items to assist with your modeling. Regarding our longer-term targets, we continue to believe that the 3% CAGR for shipbuilding revenue is appropriate. Additionally, we remain comfortable with our free cash flow target of $3.2 billion from 2020 through 2024. We plan to provide a more detailed view of 2022 on our fourth quarter call in February. Now I will turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Tom. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to 1 initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys.  At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. You may go ahead.
Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning, Myles.
Myles Walton : Was hoping I could just start with the shipbuilding revenue outlook and maybe less specific to the revenue outlook, more specific to what you're seeing in the labor workforce and moving to the low-end of this range. Is that anticipating things that you haven't seen yet as it relates to the covered mandate and what it could do to attendance, and workforce, or is it more of what you saw in the third quarter? If you get where I'm going.
Tom Steely: Hey, good morning, Myles, it's Tom. I'll start with that one. So, from an outlook perspective, we did go to the bottom end of the range. As you recall, we gave you 2 to 8 for the beginning of the year. As we see how the quarter played out right now, what's left in front of us right now. We -- when I move to shipbuilding revenue expectation that $8.2 billion. A couple of points on that right now, we're a little light on material specifically at Ingalls. If you look from a Newport News perspective, net revenues were flat.  Obviously, a little look back from a PTC perspective, but when we're talking about shipbuilding, the material lag behind roughly about $40 million in the quarter. And as we look forward into Q4. All right. That could persist. You don't see significant labor oppression at this time that's going to impact our revenue. We have a keen on right now with the EO and the mandate and how that's changing very dynamic situation there, as well as keeping an eye on our supply chain to see how the material flows here. But it's just timing right now as we see the outlook. And as I say, it's still in the range that we gave you at the beginning of the year.
Myles Walton : Okay. And what is the percent of the workforce that's currently vaccinated and if there were perturbations, is it covered in your contracts because it's a new requirement being placed upon you.
Mike Petters: Right. Miles, this is Mike. Right now, we're, I'd say, roughly around 75%. We've seen a tremendous uptick in the last 30 days and folks getting the vaccine. I think the breaking news right now, it looks like the executive orders being moved out into January and the -- and they're talking about having your shot by January, not completely through the quarantine. So, we're going to have to interpret it how all that plays out. We're working very closely with our customers on how do you implement the executive order.  I mean, the executive order is -- we've been -- we have been, from a policy standpoint, we have been directly aligned with what the white house put out. But as you hinted at there, the executive order is not contractual. And so, working with our customers on all of our contracts to figure out how best to implement that executive order is what we're doing, and we're doing that across the board. So, we're continuing to move ahead. Our ambition is to get as many of our employees vaccinated as we possibly can because we are committed to a safe workplace and we think that's the best way to do it.
Myles Walton : Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. You may go ahead.
Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Morning,
Tom Steely: .
Doug Harned : Right now, you are in the transition on Virginia-class for Block-4 to Block-5, could you comment on how block 5 looks in terms of the amount of content you have on that, and how would you describe any risks in the transition relative to the one you did when you move to block 4.
Mike Petters: Well, I'll start and then let Chris pick it up. When we kicked off block 4 the contract took quite a while to negotiate that contract and as a result, there was some late material procurement, material that kind of helped, helped us get off to a rocky start relative to that program as well as the ramp up in production. So, we had a lot of things moving, a lot of parts moving on the beginning of block 4. But we don't have any of those partners moving at the building of block 5. And so, we're -- the transition for us is moving basically, seamlessly from block 4 into block 5, pretty excited about that and pretty optimistic about where that's going to go.
Chris Kastner: No, I think that's right. And when you think through VCS and block 4 getting back to a cadence where we're floating off 1 vote a year and delivering 1 vote a year and then transitioning that workforce right into block 5 makes great sense. So, we have high hopes for performance on block 5 because of the lessons we're learning through block 4 when you get to a 2 per year cadence.
Doug Harned : And then, also in submarines, you commented this time that your services revenues were down a little bit. Can you comment on where the 3 Los Angeles class ships stand in their process and how you see services, revenues at Newport News trending over the next couple of years here?
Chris Kastner: Sure. Helena will -- this is Chris, Doug. Helena will deliver this year. Columbus is in process and moving through the cycle in their contract and Boise is really in their prompts start period. We're going to get into a place here. And I think in communication with our customer where it makes great sense to have sort of a consistent stream of work and revenue. It probably will not be as high as it's been going forward and we need to create that plan with our customer. That's the status of the three that are in Newport News now. And as I said, we're working with a customer to ensure we had a steady cadence of repair activity going forward.
Doug Harned : Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. You may go ahead.
Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. And good morning, everyone.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Seth Seifman : I wanted to start off. I think you mentioned a bit earlier that you were looking to finalize the single pay delivery agreement for the carrier with the Navy either late this year or early in 1Q. Again, can you tell us is there any margin or cash impact we should think about once that is finalized?
Chris Kastner: Yes. This is Chris. We will definitize that, if not this year, it would be beginning of next. Don't anticipate significant or margin cash impact. It's obviously an increase in the top-line for that shift, but it also extends the risk retirement events out a couple of years because it extends the test program. So, nothing significant from a material from a sales margin or cash impact at this point.
Seth Seifman : Okay. And then it seems like it's mostly a timing issue, but just wanted to ask about the cash flow guidance increase this year. Should we think about that increasing your kind of 5-year expectation or is it mainly having to do with the timing of when those progress payments go back to the government?
Tom Steely: Good morning. It's Tom. Yes, it is. The progress payments are the predominance of the change that we have right now. Obviously, another quarter with rich retirement, and we have actual -- through Q3 and we have a line of sight for the end of the year, but predominantly the change there was because of the progress payments not getting kicked into the 2022-time frame. Keep in mind to that year-end,  we have to get back half of the payroll bike attacks that we did not pay in 2020. So that's baked into the numbers. So, it's timing and within the 32, it still holds.
Seth Seifman : Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may go ahead.
Ron Epstein : Yeah. Good morning, guy.
Tom Steely: Good morning.
Ron Epstein : I was wondering if you could give us just some more color and maybe just following up on Miles’s question about what's going on in your supply chain, where you're seeing some material shortages and is it just being driven by delays in transportation or what are good.
Tom Steely: Sure. Yeah, it's Tom here. I will take that one. So, we've had this conversation on the last couple of calls and we're watching that and intently, regularly to touch base with the supply chain offices out Cabot, each of the yard, some of speed exactly on where the stand right now, as we've given in the past, because of the nature of our long-term contracts, long-term material orders that start ahead of the construction of these contracts. And then obviously with the backlog that we have this spin-off contracting, you have line of sight of the work that's going to be performed in the yards.  A significant amount of those requirements has already been put on order and we're managing them aggressively over the next  material flows in hits the end-year need dates. Preponderance of the material is coming in on time and meeting the contractual needs that we have within the art. I would tell you that recently, less 3 to 6 months that as we have spot orders, what we're seeing is a little bit of volatility in pricing and the validity days of shrinking a little bit on things that we have spots high.  But from a perspective of Execution of the existing contracts we have we don't see a significant impact at this time. Obviously, we're watching how the EO mandate impacts a supply chain. And the precious that we do, we do here are our second and fifth third tier were dependent on the raw materials. So copper cabling, things of that nature. But again, as we stand here today, the supply chain that we need because of how we've contracted at work in advance, has us maintaining schedule at this time.
Ron Epstein : Okay. Got it. All right. Thanks for that. And then on the Technical Services business, if we just open up the aperture a little bit and think about when we walk out 2, 3, 4 years from now, where do you see the margin in that business? I mean, presumably it's going to be much better than where it is today. And I'm just curious, I mean, if you can just give us -- I know you're not giving forward guidance, most companies don't do it. So, I'm not asking for that but just -- if you can put a little framework around how we should think about the margin in that business as we think longer term.
Tom Steely: Yes. So, because of how we put that division together with the acquisitions, purchase, intangibles, and things of that nature. If you noticed, we've been guiding and driving towards an EBITDA relationship against the performance and where we see. You've noticed from the announcement we had on the July time frame and then with July, close in August, we've got  on how that was going to cause a lift there. From a rough perspective, we were at 45%. We dialed in from an EBITDA perspective to be in the 8% to 10% range by 2024. Both the initial guidance we gave you in the July time frame of Alion supported that. As we sit today after the close in August and that close to the quarter with Alion cranked into our financials.  They're hovering on the low end of the range right now so that's good news because that's more than 50% of that portfolio. I think going forward as we see those purchase intangibles get burnt off for the next 3, 4, 5 years going forward, obviously that's going to be an improvement. I would tell you that PI is baked into the rocks, although the rocks, even for this quarter TSD is 2.6% with $8 million of purchase intangibles when you roll that out at the 5.3% last quarter and the EBITDA is at 7% right now. So that's a near-term perspective and how I see it evolving in the out years.
Ron Epstein : Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes, you had mentioned that the margin and Shipbuilding in Q4 of the similar to Q3 because some. Items moved to Q3. Can you just list what moved to Q3? And I thought you'd mentioned some might have moved to Q1 were so Next year. What do we expect in Q2 -- in Q4 for incentives versus what we had thought before?
Tom Steely: Hey, George. It's Tom here. Good morning. Yes. I'll take that. Just a couple of moving parts there. We guided Q2 going into Q3 would be licensed for it would be a little bit heavier than that. We have pulled a couple of incentives at Newport News on the RCOH fund from 73 to the left, as well as before? Ingalls taken DDG 121 to trials was a risk retirement evaluation on a bad so just a couple of moving parts there from Q3 to Q4. But we're still in the lane there of the 7.5% to 8% that we gave you for shipbuilding, for year-end. I didn't mention anything moving into next year. In my remarks, we do have LPD 28 moving or staying on contracting in the beginning of 2022.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then just a separate one, probably more for Mike. I noticed that Newport News you got like -- they're a union contract with perfecting 50% of the workers up to November here now, so if you could give us what you think about the status here. I mean, I guess it's more in the news given the contract results at the end of the year.
Chris Kastner: Yes. George Oliver. George, I'll start. This is Chris. We're in process with the Newport News union working through that contract with a very good relationship with them and I fully expect we can come to a reasonable agreement on a contract. I know Mike ran Newport News for a while, so he probably has for a long time actually, probably has better comments on that, but we're working with them every day to try to get to a resolution.
George Shapiro: Okay, thanks.
Mike Petters: We pride ourselves on having very constructive relationships with our labor partners and I don't think this will be any different than that.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Mike Petters:  George.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Shapiro Research. You may go ahead.
Richard Safran: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Richard Safran: So, it's -- on the Navy's new destroyer crews or class, the ship doesn't appear to be slated to arrive until very late in the decade. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that represents a bit of a slide to the right in terms of schedule. Could you discuss a timeline for a competition and following up on your opening remarks, I'm wondering how you think that the Navy strategy with the new ship now impacts to buy the new flight of DDG 51 since the new ship isn't arriving. Now for close to ten years down the line. I'm thinking that really reinforces the idea of a new flight of DDG, but that's my view is I was wondering what you think of that.
Mike Petters: This is Mike. I don't think you're too far off there, just in general. I think general principles are -- it's really hard to pin down the development, path, and timeline for a new program like this, this early in the process. They are trying to work through -- how do they fund the design, how they fund the project? When are they going to have it, where the requirement is going to be? That's a pretty dynamic thing and so trying to pin that down precisely. It is a bit of a challenge. And our general view is that you don't really want to stop production of a line until you're ready to move to a mature design product going forward.  So as that product matures, it will interact. The construction work that's going on So, DDGs today, the flight 3 ships will -- my -- we certainly will advocate and believe that the best prudent course ahead will be to continue to build flight threes until that designer is maturing. We're ready to go into production on that. And if that happens to be 20 something else, then it's 20 something else, and then we will be ready. As far as the competition for that goes, it'll -- that will just lay in as that program matures, we'll get more visibility into what the competition -- when it might be, what it would look like, and that sort of thing.  I think it would be a mistake though for there to be any sort of curtailment in the destroyer program. Anticipating some kind of maturation path. We kind of went down that path in a couple of programs during my career, we've done that with submarines. We did that, actually, with DDGs and we tried to transition over to the 1,000s and then transitioned back. So, we had a gap and then short program. Our industry is full of people who have seen gaps in production become tremendous problems for restarts of production. So, let's keep the production line moving. And when the production line, when the design to churn off to transition, we will transition it.
Richard Safran: Okay. Thanks for that. And, you know, more general, I thought you could talk a little bit about efficiency initiatives while back we had things like digital transformation, but I thought you might discuss efforts to reduce costs and then in your answer, maybe you could talk about how much that might contribute to margin improvement. Any objective eventually, getting to 9% margins.
Chris Kastner: This is Chris, I won't discuss the contribution to the margin rate. And when we expect to get to 9%, we'll talk a lot more about that on the year-end call. But the capital investments we've made in technology investments we've made both Ingalls and Newport News are going very well. And the simplest form at Ingalls getting all the work on undercover really drives efficiency if you've ever been in Mississippi in August and then the digital shipbuilding products are becoming more mature and help on the manufacturing and CVN 80 and the Columbia class. so, we're very encouraged by the technology investments in the capital investments we've made and we hope to continue to drive costs out of our products.
Richard Safran: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. You may go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Good morning, guys.
Dwayne Blake: Go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Just a follow-on to Seth's question on the Kennedy. Chris, I think you say you're going to get the contract defeminization that's going to maybe move the risk registers to the right a little bit. I just want to make sure I'm in line with. I think I've been assuming that the Kennedy retirement opportunities, those retirement opportunities who will be 2022 2023. Is that still the case or are they shifted to the right at 24 or 25. I just want to level set that.
Chris Kastner: No, no. 23 and 24 make a lot of sense. We're really in volume when it comes to 79 right now getting through compartments and work packages, starting localized testing. But it's 23, 24-time frame.
Pete Skibitski: I appreciate that and maybe one for you, Mike. I always like to ask any hope left on with NFC 12, it seems like all the committees have reported I wasn't sure if anyone stuck in any language or funding at all with regard to that?
Mike Petters: Well, I think, you're reading that right. We are -- we have a great product line there and we're very excited about what we've done. But right now, there's just this -- in the contest for resources it's not fairing very well. So, we'll probably just leave it at that.
Pete Skibitski: Yeah. Those always seems to come up short and I know, too bad. All right, thanks, guys.
Operator: Next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. You may now go ahead.
David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about Alion. I think when you announced the deal, you talked about $1.6 billion in annualized revenue. Based when you do in the quarter and when you're applying for the year and it would seem like either it's running well below that or you're expecting big growth in ' 22. Can you just comment on that?
Tom Steely: Sure. Yeah. Good morning. So, for the court, I think in my remarks, you'll see a $163 million Q3 from the line perspective. You kind of run that out for another quarter as Q4, that's the run rate. A little over $300 million there. so collectively it's about $450 million. On an annualized basis, that's like $1.4 and change. And then you get to the 1/6 growth rate of a little bit higher than 11.5%, 12%, so that's the math of it right now. We still stand by the guidance that we. And revenue and the 135 adjusted EBITDA.
Chris Kastner: David, this is Chris. I'd also add that the integration of the front end of that business has gone very well in business development and capture. We have a $60 billion total pipeline that we're working through and prioritizing a number of significant competitions over the next . and a book-to-bill at 1.8 in the quarter. So, all indications are positive for that business.
David Strauss : Okay. Thanks for that. As a follow-up, I want to ask about the, Tom, the long-term free cash flow profile. Obviously, you're sticking with the 3.2. I think previously you had said that '22, '23, '24, that time frame would be fairly -- free cash flow over that period will be fairly ratable across those years. Is that still the view or is there -- is it going to ramp during that period? Thanks.
Tom Steely: Yeah. So, as you said, the Q2 is still good. We have 757 behind us. I've given you the outlook for this year, so it's about 1-1 and that leads to what last over the last three years. So strict to pick map would be about $700 million. We do have a next year, as I mentioned, we have to pay back the fica payments, so that's $66 million. We have progress payments that have to be paid back, that's $100 -- around $160, so you can do some math on that, but there is a ramp to it. So, between those 2 payments and just a slight ramp, I mean, you can just model those 3 years out, but we still feel comfortable and it's appropriate to guide to $3.2 billion over these 5 years.
David Strauss : All right, perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Again,  Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.
Noah Poponak : Good morning, everyone.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Noah Poponak : Tom. With these outsides of the normal course of business items, supply-chain, with just their material labor. And then also combining that with the, with how the growth compares shakeout. Should we be seeing thinking of next year? the shipbuilding growth rate being fairly back-end loaded versus the first-half? And then just following up on that Alion discussion there, are you seeing -- we've seen those headwinds across hardware and outside of hardware. Are you seeing some of those same challenges outside of the business in Alion or not as much?
Tom Steely: Sure. For the first part, from a shipbuilding perspective, I highlighted a little bit earlier, I didn't hit the backlog piece of the outlook, right? So, unlike say, requiring needed new awards or funding, we have a line of sight of the work that we have in-house. So, I look at, from an outlook perspective, from shipbuilding. Still the 3% CAGR is good. I would tell you that although it looks like we're at the same point we were through the first 3 quarters of this year compared to last year, last year was an exceptional year, '18 to '19 with the 6% growth and then '19 to '20 with another 6% growth. And even specifically Q4 last year was a 19% growth over the quarter previously there.  So, some material as I highlighted -- as actually Chris has moved into the end of Q4 of 2020, it made that year look big, which now makes 2021 look flat. So, I'm not concerned right now because we have the backlog, we have the work, we have the labor force right now. We are watching materials as I said and we're watching if the EO mandate impacts our workforce, but I don't -- I'm not concerned with how 2021 was shaking out from a revenue perspective. And I would think going forward that it's pretty linearly in 2022 for ship building.  Relative to your lying question, I don't see obviously, their contracts are different, more service oriented. We're excited with them on board. Andy has put his leadership team in play, as Chris had mentioned earlier, the initial assessments that we had going into the purchase and now the close we've had a good 6 weeks run rate in the financials and look under the hood there. We're comfortable with what's in front of them. The items that they're bidding, and how they're executing on the existing contracts for evaluating the revenue synergies between Alion making us better, the DFS and MDIF and vice versa.  So, I feel comfortable with that going forward there. I don't see today, again, the EL mandate significantly impacting our revenue expectations from an Alion perspective. We have highlighted from a  perspective. When you get to watch the funding come about and the unmanned portfolio evolve and grow going forward. Special watch on for us.
Noah Poponak : Okay. Thank you.
Operator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Petters with any closing remarks?
Mike Petters: Well, thank you. And I want to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. Before I close, I wanted to pass on to you that Dwayne Blake has informed me that he wishes to retire.
Dwayne Blake: Deny that request, Mike.
Mike Petters: Yeah. I've already turn it down a couple of times. But Dwayne and his family, they've been parts of our family here for 37 years. His personal support for all of us here at Huntington, it -- throughout his career, but especially in his last position here had just been extraordinary. So, when you call today to harass Dwayne about the filing or the call, just remember, he's a short timer now and so he might have some leverage in that call. With that, we wish Dwayne and his family well, and we wish them all the best as they move forward with the next chapter of their lives. And with that, we appreciate your interest in HII and we welcome your continued engagement and your feedback. Thank you very much.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2021 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the call over to Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Blake, you may now begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal Securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in the remarks today, Mike, Chris and Tom will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning we released strong second quarter 2021 financial results driven by another quarter of solid operational performance. So let me share some highlights from the quarter, starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.2 billion were up from $2.0 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Diluted EPS of $3.20 was up significantly from a $1.30 in the second quarter of last year and pension adjusted EPS for the quarter was $3.05. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion, resulting in a backlog of approximately $48 billion, of which approximately $24 billion is funded. And Chris will provide some color on a few of the key awards for the quarter during his remarks. Shifting to activities in Washington, we're pleased with a congressional markup process for fiscal year 2022 has begun an earnest following release of the president's budget request in May. Of note, the budget request continued recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic missile submarine fleet, and supported funding for CVN 80 and CVN 81 Ford-class aircraft carriers, two Virginia-Class submarines, one DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and LHA 9. We were also pleased that a second DDG 51 class destroyer was included as the number one priority on the Navy's unfunded requirements list for fiscal year 2022. And we look forward to working closely with the Congress during the FY 2022 markup process to urge support for the second DDG and other critical priorities, including the efficient production of amphibious warships. In closing Slide 4 provides some key takeaways from the recently announced agreement to acquire Alion Science and Technology. The team is preparing for closing of the transaction, and we are very excited about the addition of Alion to the HII family. Alion is a perfect complement to our existing capabilities in the technology driven defense and federal solution space. The solutions and products they provide are directly in line with the strategic focus that we have articulated for our technical solutions business and it enhances our technical capabilities and customer access in high growth national security markets, including C5ISR, Military Training & Simulation, and Next Generation Technologies & Solutions. We firmly believe that Alion offers significant growth potential and represents an investment in capabilities that support the evolving DoD national security requirements, which in turn are expected to generate significant long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers, and our employees. Now, I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the operations. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. This was another solid operational quarter and I'm very pleased with the consistent progress being achieved across our shipbuilding and technical solutions programs. With that, let me share a few key contract awards and programmatic highlights from the business segments for the quarter. At Ingalls, the team received a contract modification from the U.S. Navy for $107 million to provide additional long lead time material and advanced procurement activities for amphibious assault ship LHA 9, which increases current funding on this ship to approximately $490 million. Regarding the potential bundled acquisition of LHA 9 with LPD 32 and LPD 33, discussions are ongoing with the customer. We believe that a bundled acquisition continues to be the most cost effective method of procurement of these critically important ships. In addition, Ingalls was awarded a contract with a potential total value of $724 million over seven years for planning yard services and supportive of a variety of in-service amphibious class ships, including the LPD 17 San Antonio class and LHA 6 America class. Shifting to program status, LHA 8 Bougainville is making steady progress through the structural erection and initial outfitting phases of construction with costs and schedule performance in line with our expectations. On the DDG program, the team successfully launched the first Flight III Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer DDG 125 Jack H. Lucas in June and DDG 121 Frank E. Peterson, Jr. is expected to conduct sea trials later this year. On the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale is on track to conduct sea trials during the fourth quarter and LPD 29 Richard M. McCool Jr. continues to achieve production milestones in supportive launch early next year. A Newport News there were no significant contract awards to highlight for the quarter. So I will go right onto program status CVN 79, Kennedy is approximately 83% complete, and the team remains focused on compartment completion and key propulsion plant milestones. CVN 73, USS George Washington is approximately 90% complete and the team remains focused on achieving key test program milestones to support redelivery to the Navy, which is planned for next year. On the VCS program, the team completed shipment of the final module of SSN 797 Iowa during the quarter. In addition, SSN 794 Montana remains on track for delivery to the Navy later this year and SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float off milestone as planned in the second half of this year. And finally on the submarine fleet support program, SSN 725, Helena is on track for redelivery to the Navy later this year. At technical solutions, contract awards are bringing this 300 unmanned underwater vehicles during the quarter to the U.S. Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy affirm the flexibility and modularity of these units. TS was also recently awarded a 273 million cost plus fixed fee indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract to support maintenance and planning for the overhaul and repair of equipment and systems associated with the Navy aircraft carriers and West Coast Navy surfer ships. In addition, TS was awarded a contract with a one-year base period in four one-year options with a total potential value of $346 million to provide a variety of aircraft and operational support services for U.S., Afrikaan included planning, management, maintenance, logistics, and airlift, airdrop services and emergency medical care. Execution within technical solutions remains consistent with expectations except for delays in awards and our unmanned business for critical new programs, which we expect to be resolved by the end of the year. As I close, note that we have included upcoming key program milestones on Slide 5. There are no changes from what we have previously provided other than designated those milestones that have been completed with the check mark. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for his remarks on the financials. Tom?
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I'll briefly review our second quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 6 of the presentation, our second quarter revenues of $2.2 billion increased approximately 10% capacity at the same period last year. This was primarily due to the growth of Newport News and Ingalls and was partially offset by decline at technical solutions due to the portfolio of shaping actions we have taken. Segment operating income for the quarter of $169 million increased $174 million compared to the second quarter of 2020, and segment operating margin of 7.6% compares to a segment operating margin of negative 0.2% of the second quarter of 2020. The prior year results were negatively impacted by the Virginia-Class submarine program performance as well as impacts related to COVID-19. Operating income for the quarter of $128 million increased by $71 million from the second quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 5.7% increased 293 basis points. These increases were primarily driven by the segments, I just mentioned partially offset by a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment. The tax rate in the quarter was approximately 19.9% compared to 18.5% in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in the tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to research and development tax credits recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Net earnings in the quarter were $129 million compared to $53 million in the second quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.20 compared to $1.30 in the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the impacts of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.05 compared to a loss of $0.49 per share in the second quarter of 2020. Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation; cash from operations was $96 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $73 million or 3.3% of revenues resulting in free cash flow of $23 million. This compassed to cash from operations of $201 million and $75 million of net capital expenditures or free cash flow of $126 million in the second quarter of 2020. Cash contribution to our pension and other postretirement benefit plan were $12 million in the quarter, principally related to postretirement benefits. During the second quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million. And we purchased approximately 95,000 shares at a cost of $20 million. Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation, Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $670 million increased $48 million or 7.7% from the same period last year. Driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program and amphibious assault ships partially offset by low revenues on the NSC program. Ingalls operating income of $80 million and margin of 11.9% in the quarter were up from the second quarter of 2020, driven by the recognition of a capital investment related incentive for the DDG program that was recognized in DDG 125, as well as higher risk retirement on LHA 8, LP 28 and LP 29 ships. Turning to Slide 9 of the presentation, Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased $241 million or 21.5% from the same period last year due to high revenues in both the submarine and aircraft carrier construction. Newport News operating income of $76 million and margin of 5.6% in the quarter were up year-over-year primarily due to the impacts related to the Virginia-Class performance and COVID in the prior year period. Now at the Technical Solutions on Slide 10. Technical solutions, revenues of $237 million in the quarter decreased 25.9% from the same period last year, mainly due to the divestiture of the oil and gas business and the contribution of the San Diego shipyard to a joint venture in the first quarter of this year, as well as low volumes and unmanned systems partially offset by increases in volumes and the defense in frontal solutions. Technical solutions operating income of $13 million in the quarter compassed to the income of $9 million in the second quarter of 2020. This increase was primarily driven by high equity income related to our ship repair partnership with Titan as well as improved performance at defense and federal solutions and nuclear environmental services, partially offset by lower volumes in the unmanned system. Finally, a perspective on the outlook of the shipbuilding for the remaining part of the year. We continue to see limited opportunities for risk-free tightness in the third quarter, with the remainder of the milestones weighted towards the end of the year. Given the strong performance of the first half of the year, we now expect that the shipbuilding margins for the full year will be in the 7.5% to 8% range. We continue to expect the align acquisition will close in the coming weeks and that we will incur approximately $25 million of one-time pre-tax transaction and financing related expenses in 2021. We completed the syndication of the term-loan component of the acquisition funding earlier this week and more details of the specifics are available in the 10-Q. We will provide a more comprehensive update on our 2021 outlook for technical solutions on our third quarter call following the closing of the acquisition. Now, turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Tom. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Good morning, thank you.
Mike Petters: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Harned: In Q2, you had a big increase in Newport News revenues. And when you look at the back half of the year, you've got several pretty important milestones. So you've got a lot going on there. Can you give us a sense of sort of what took the revenues up so much in Q2? And how we should expect the workflow in revenues to kind of play out over these next few quarters?
Tom Stiehle: Sure. It’s Tom here. Good morning, Doug. I appreciate the question here. Although the growth year-over-year for Q2 was large, capital result took a charge in Q2 last year for the Virginia-Class programs, so that comes on the margin side and the revenue side. So, it has a 21% increase, looking larger than it is. I'll tell you on the back half of the year with COVID understood right now the labor force stable, the contracts that we have no place right now. The run rate that we see is going to play out pretty consistent to the back half of the year. I’d say it's probably a flat to consistent back half of the year. I wouldn't let it run away from you as you try and see the growth from a year-over-year perspective and stick with the guidance that we gave you back at the beginning of the year, I still think that we're running on top of that.
Doug Harned: Okay. And then you got this $926 million service award at Ingalls, you're in the process of working through the Los Angeles classwork as well in services. Can you give us a sense of how you expect services revenues to flow? Because I always think of this as something that we kind of know that trajectory for shipbuilding, but services is less certain. So how do you see that flowing? And do you get a sense on your Navy and budget discussions that – that there is going to be a pretty consistent driver of revenue coming from the services side?
Tom Stiehle: Yes. So, a couple of parts on that answer there. On the Ingalls award down there, it's a long-term services type contract, obviously as the claims in the years get funded in the out years, we'll see that revenue mature down there. The services contract they have is the oversight and then the services aspect for the LPD and LHA program. So that was anticipated as far as our revenue projections that we had for you there. It's not a large portion of the Ingalls portfolio as you see it today. There are potentials going forward depending on how the landscape plays out both from a construction and feature services and our own type work to play out. We'll have to see how that goes forward. From a Newport News perspective, as you mentioned, we took on the LA's overhaul right now. So those were anticipated in our plans also, that was an overflow, right, from where the Navy was. I think medium to long-term we'd like to see ourselves get into a cadence of getting an overhaul on the subside going forward. And as we work with our Navy partner and what that kind of looks like, we'll provide additional guidance on that front.
Doug Harned: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Hi, Mike, I think in your remarks, you talked about stability or more predictability in the emptive purchasing power or purchasing strategy. And I guess you've got to a "handshake agreement" with the Navy. The congressional committees are pushing that to be more formalized into a contract. Can you just give some color aside from the greater visibility of having the ships under contract? What are the financial implications to Huntington Ingalls? I know there is savings for the customer. I'm just curious from a financial perspective to the company, how would it change if they bought it individually or they bought by agreement?
Mike Petters: Yes, so I'll just kind of talk in general, anytime you're in a multi-year program, you're able to sequence the schedule of the platforms super informed to the way you've got your capital and your people and your material lined up. And you get into, as Tom used the work cadence, where cadence matters a lot – yet in this case, getting the LPDs and the LHA on in a cadence that's predictable over the next several years creates a foundation for all the other programs that Ingalls is going to be working, we're chasing, we're trying to capture. So it's a foundational piece of predictability from a cost structure, rate structure perspective. And I guess our view of that is that if you can get that locked in and create that kind of stability it's worth the savings to our customer, customer gets a good price for it, but it's also worth that to us from the standpoint of predictability. So that's kind of the way we think about it. I don't know Thomas do you want to add any more to that or Chris?
Myles Walton: Okay.
Chris Kastner: Yes. So, Myles, its Chris. It really solidifies the next three to four years at Ingalls moving forward and maybe even more important than that, it solidifies the supply base that we keep that that ship class moving on a normal cadence to support Ingalls' readily over the next three to five years.
Mike Petters: Sure. And I would probably just follow-up on the back of that too. As you know these bundles whether it's a bundle like we're doing here or a multi-year that provide flexibility to our customers and our parties down there, so whether they decide to take the bundle that's on the table now, or buy them kind of separately, the financial impact – so that obviously, as Mike said, this rates – this rates that come into play, the schedule of the ships, how we buy the material in a lot quantity or do we buy them individually. So all that factors into an affordability profitability piece of the equation now, but we put that forth to be as flexible to our Navy customer as possible and we'll see how they move forward with appropriate funds and award accordingly.
Myles Walton: Okay. And I think you increased the five-year cash flow to $3.2 billion after Alion acquisition from 2020 to 2024. As we look to 2022 to 2024, I guess it implies the $740 million or so is that – Mike, is that a linear profile? Is it a big step up with a significantly higher backends? Can you just give any color to that as you see it today?
Mike Petters: Yes. So they come online, as you know, we closed on the deal in August. In Q3, you'll get a look – see of the financials when the line rolled in there. We'll give you a little bit more color during the Q3 call for the specifics on how we do see 2021 falling out and then give additional color, as I hold until Q4 in the February timeframe of next year when we give that guidance going forward. I mean there's only so many ways you can spread the $200 million, but I just hold the thought there until we come through the integration and we finish out this year.
Myles Walton: Okay. All right, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.
Mike Petters: Hi.
Robert Spingarn: Tom, the margins at Newport News were a bit below where we were thinking and also below the underlying margins we've seen over the past couple of quarters. So I wanted to just ask what's going on there, driving the fluctuations in the underlying margins XEACs or was this net – negative EACs at work, and while we're at it, maybe you can just give us the EAC splits between the segments. Thank you.
Mike Petters: That's great. I appreciate the questions. Sure. So now from a Newport News perspective, we kind of guided in Q1 if there was not going to be many opportunities for risk retirement and milestone from Q2 and Q3 that was exasperated at Newport News. I'd tell you although 5,000, 6,000 a bit low when you combine it with the first quarter, it's 6.1 for the first half year. So it's right in the runway of 6, 7 even if it's on the long side. It was not impacted by any major setbacks. The – favorably EAC increases was $62 million, the unfavorable was $27 million down for a net $35 million. And the upside is a little bit slated towards the Ingalls and then on the unfavorable assistance, slightly slopped from 50:50 towards Newport News, but there wasn't anything specific to call out there. On the favorable side, you will find in the Q there was – and in my comments upfront that the DDG 125 took an incentive for the CapEx and there was some solid performance and risk reduction at LHA, LPD 28 and LPD 29. But on the downside, there is nothing notable to kind of highlight here. Okay.
Robert Spingarn: Can you quantify the benefit of the capital investment incentive recognized on Jack Lucas?
Mike Petters: Yeah. It's up $14 million, and you will find that in the Q, it's upfront.
Robert Spingarn: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning. It seems like you've raised the shipbuilding margin for the year that this benefit from – this capital investment benefit was something that you weren't anticipating? Or is it raised because you're expecting higher EACs in the second half of the year? Or it's just continued performance versus the first half?
Tom Stiehle: Good morning, George. It’s Tom here. I'll tell you that we're happy in the books. We kind of have a line of sight the year is going to play out. So factoring in actually the two quarters than what we see here. We're still foreshadowing that Q3 is going to be in light in terms of milestones and risk retirements in the backend of the year for traditional opportunities another six months of a run rate to burn down risk. So, I think, we just felt comfortable and we wanted to help The Street understand where we think we're going to land by year's end.
George Shapiro: Okay. But specifically was that capital investment benefit not an expected thing for the year?
Tom Stiehle: So, George, it's a one-time event and it was expected, but it doesn't play out in the run rate for the range that we're giving you at 7.5% to 8%.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then one, the free cash flow is pretty weak in the first half and it looks like working capital was up north of $200 million. The guide of $150 million to $250 million for the year still holds and what would it cause the second quarter to be as weak as it was. Thanks.
Mike Petters: Sure. So, I'll tell you traditionally we use cash up front, so we punched out a minus 16 in the first quarter 2023 up here for net of plus seven through the first half of the year, not unexpected. And then Q2 was – the working capital was 7.9%. So, again, in the range of 6 to 8 what we expect. The back half of the year usually does see some favorability to the working capital, and that will come a little bit that we have to keep our eye on as we have to pay back the couple of progress payments at the end of 2021 and that may gates some of the positives – positiveness that you'd see in the working capital traditionally in the back half of HII. So from where we stand here to get to the $150 million to $250 million, it's just the number of operational run on the revenues and the payments flow to the book.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hi, thanks. Thanks very much and good morning. A question, I guess, about profitability and whether I guess – if you look at the margin side and you talk about the opportunities for risk retirement later in the year and sort of the correlation between those two things, I guess, the new margin guide implies a down margin in the second half versus the first half, but you look at all the opportunities to check off at Newport News and even at Ingalls where margins have been very strong still more risk retirements ahead than have been checked off. So, I guess, the first part is kind of given this list for the second half, but why wouldn't we expect a stronger shipbuilding margin than we saw in first half. And then second, I guess, when we look at 2022 and we see sort of fewer milestones for Newport News, how do we think about – what that means for profitability there, and then Ingalls kind of coming off a high base, but obviously it looks like there's a lot to do there. So, I guess, looking at the correlation between these upcoming milestones and the ship building margins?
Mike Petters: Sure. Yes, I can give you some color on both of those questions. So when you look at Q1, Q2, this was quite a few one-time events. Other than that, the incentives we're talking about here, on DDG 125 in Q2, Q1 there was a couple of incentives in there too, that we've highlighted. But I've been asked, can Ingalls keep this up at 14% and now 11.9%. And I keep providing the guidance down that that's not a run rate that's sustainable, I think between the one-time events and the incentives that we talked that – we'll see that come down. So I wouldn't really read that because we're giving you the 7.5% to 8% that somehow the margins are dropping off from a performance or operational standpoint at Ingalls. It's just that we won't see those one-time events in Q3 and Q4. From the question on the Newport News perspective, right now, if you look at it, they have a lot of new ships in their portfolio, right. So CVN 80, CVN 81 is coming online. There is a CVN 74 that just popped in here. And CVN 73 is nearing the end from a revenue perspective, and they have less weight on the portfolio there. So it's the mix of the ships that are in at Newport News. So when you talk about 2022 timeframe, those ships as they run through another three, four, five quarters, that'd be burning down risk, and there'll be a potential to increase booking rates.
Seth Seifman: Okay, great. I will take the one . Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Good morning guys.
Mike Petters: Good morning, Ron.
Ron Epstein: Just quickly, could you give us an update on how things are proceeding with the Virginia-Class? Because that's a program that you ran into some challenges in the last 18 months, and how is it tracking now?
Chris Kastner: Yes, Ron, this is Chris. I'll start, if Mike wants to add on here. We'll do that, but really team performing well and the partnership performing well. Montana is proceeding to delivery this year, and New Jersey is proceeding to launch and then delivering next year, and then the shops are executing on the modules to support assembly for the subsequent votes. So confident and comfortable with how the Block IV and Block V programs are executing right now. Mike you want to... 
Mike Petters: Yes. Having to say that, moving the two per year in Block IV, and then we’ve been adding in the Virginia payload module in Block V. Success is going if it depend on rhythm and what we have established here; Chris's team and Jennifer, as the shipyard is establishing right now is they're establishing a rhythm and a program that's going to make them comfortable. We were working that when COVID hit us last year. And so we kind of hasn't stepped back a little bit and reset, but we're pretty excited right now about what's happening today, but also the rhythm that we're setting up for the rest of this program and the rest of the next programs; so pretty excited about that.
Ron Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then maybe just another with summary and question; this, do you guys, does the industrial have enough manpower labor right now to do the Virginia and the Columbia at the projected rates, where in a given year, if there's two Virginia’s delivered and Columbia, so you get three-subs. Is there enough capacity in terms of a qualified on a pipe fitters to do that?
Mike Petters: Well, Ron, I guess if you took a – if you decided that everything was static and then you had to do all of that with the people that you have in the plant today, the answer is no, we don't have enough people in the plant today to do that. The fact is that we've been, since COVID began last March, we hired 6,000 people and train them and I will be forever remembered for saying that we can build capacity in the industry faster than the government can appropriate funding for it. So if the government wants to move ahead with a higher rate of so many production in a sustained way, not just doing it once in a while, but in a some sort of sustained way they want to go to three submarines a year or three Virginia-Class a year or two Virginia-Class and a Columbia a year, and they're going to sustain that for a period of time. We can absolutely have the workforce and the physical plant and the supply chain set up to go execute that. You set that it's a light switch and starting in the FY 2022 budget we're going to expand the buy from two to four. Well, we probably have some startup paints there, but we don't believe that's the way that's going to go. We believe that this has going to be done in concert, that's the history of it. And so I think I guess my own experience is that when you hear budget, people talking about lack of capacity, what they really mean is if they don't have fund, and that's, that's kind of the way the industry looks at it. So I think we can – we can expand, we can expand capacity if that's the plan, if it's the sustained.
Ron Epstein: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Gautam Khanna: Hey guys, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about integration planning and sort of what early milestones we should be thinking about on the Alion deal to make sure that it's tracking the plan. So could you little – could you outline what you're doing, I know you're planning in terms of integration, sort of what the, what you hope to have accomplished by the end of the year with that deal?
Chris Kastner: Gautam, you've got to be careful here because this is Chris, we're not closed yet, obviously. She doesn’t want to get ahead of that. I will say that we had a very detailed immigration plan in place and then working very well with the Alion and in putting that plan in place. And I'd also I could say that Alion leadership team is going to play a very prominent role in the leadership team, king of the combined company when we do get closed. And we'll be able to report that the status of the integration on the Q3 call, but I don’t want to get in front of closing on that. And Mike, I won't hold up if you want to add anything.
Mike Petters: I mean, I think we – I'll always say that we integrated high board last year. We have a blueprint for how to get into that effective and efficient way. Obviously this is a  but muscles are to same. I'm pretty excited about; I'm excited about the opportunity to do this. There will be a lot of hard work by a lot of folks, but it will be the right time stuff to do. So, and we're certainly going to keep you posted on that.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And just as a follow-up, you talked about the $14 million benefit from the capital incentive this quarter. If I recall last quarter, you guys talked about Q2 and Q3 having fewer shipbuilding milestones. And I know this has been asked on the call, but I just trying to get a sense for; should we have thought about the potential for team catch-ups, maybe last quarter as $35 million minus the $14 million, like when we say not a lot of team catch up are opportunities, is $20 million sort of the not a lot opportunity, or should we think of it as like zero. There isn't a lot of, risk retirement opportunities. Because I guess, that was sort of the upside that certainly relative to my expectations walking in today, but there was an opportunity for a lot of favorable net adjustments.
Mike Petters: Yes, I'll hop in there, we give that guidance. You talk about, hey milestones, hard milestones, so either milestones that if the, if we hit the milestone, we take a step up, as we check the EAC, we sell ship-off, really defined milestones that will bring in additional margin. So, I mean, that's true when we got it in Q1 and it's true right now when I look at punch through via Q2 into Q3. As I mentioned there was $62 million of $27 million out for net $35 million in the $62 million is $14 million of it, right? So as you're doing the math of that, I guess we're asking, hey zero to $20 million and $40 million is a of catch-up, as I mentioned to you 60-40 Ingles versus a Newport News there, but hey, just steady performance down at Ingles LHA, LPD programs. And there wasn't a specific hard milestone, but as we come through our quarterly EAC processes. We check the burn rate and the risk registers and where we stand. And the programs are running smoothly right now. So I don't think out of ordinary performance there and I think our guidance still holds true about Q3 is going to be light on milestones and there's opportunities over the next six months to retire additional risk.
Gautam Khanna: Thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Noah Poponak: Tom, did you say you also had capital investment related incentive in the first quarter?
Tom Stiehle: I may have said that, but now that you bring it up again, we had an ECP that we closed out and I mistakenly put capital incentive. So we had an ECP on a DDG program that cleaned up for us.
Noah Poponak: Okay. Yes, I was going to say I was looking for that and I couldn't find it. Is that, something that has the potential to occur often and it's usually small enough to not call out or is it, or is that pretty unusual?
Mike Petters: We do have ECPs that closed that from time-to-time, they not big adjustments that happened to be a rather larger adjustment that we had; and so that – that kind of weighed into the Q1 timeframe.
Noah Poponak: And the same question on capital incentive?
Mike Petters: Fairly unusual to have a capital incentive that large.
Noah Poponak: Okay.
Mike Petters: So we work, we work ourselves through, as we come through on these ECP that we provide for book proposals. We go to the table and negotiate. There's a balance of affordability and equity on these deals. And as we work ourselves through, sometimes they take time and then as we settled the deal whether it's additional large capital incentive. We'll let the street know when we close the booking.
Noah Poponak: Got it. Is there any other change to the previously provided 2021 guidance items outside of what you've mentioned on the shipbuilding margin?
Mike Petters: No. We're going to give additional guidance that said in Q3 as we close out.
Noah Poponak: So that, that not being in the release or the deck is mainly just a reiteration as opposed to something else.
Mike Petters: That's correct.
Noah Poponak: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
David Strauss: So in terms of performance year-to-date, does it change anything about how you're thinking about the shipbuilding margin progression beyond 2021? I think you've talked about low-80% in 2022 and then going up from there. So anything about the performance year-to-date give you more confidence. Maybe that could be a little bit better than that?
Mike Petters: No. I would say where we got guided and where we expected today, and our outlook right now and next year is still whole.
David Strauss: Okay. And Tom, what has to happen from a working capital perspective over the next couple of years to be able to hit this $3 billion or $3.2 billion, I guess, with Alion included in it that, that free cash flow target. What's that embed for working capital and where specifically could the working capital upside come from?
Tom Stiehle: Well, I think what we've always talked about is the working capital will be between 6% and 8%. So I think we'll continue to run operations accordingly. The Alion portfolio 85% costs that contract. So we don't see that as a claim from a working capital perspective as that gets integrated into the HI portfolio. But the big drivers that we kind of had highlighted how that $3 billion and now $3.2 billion come about, well more from a function of the 3% CAGR from the revenue, the margin rates popping up from shipbuilding, the capital getting back to 2.5%. And then we run through the math of that. The pension we've kind of cleaned up with Safe Harbor, so there's not going to be fluctuations on that front. I think on a couple of calls we've worked that through for $700 million on a run rate was attainable price of Alion purchase.
David Strauss: Okay. And thinking on pension is still, it's kind of a net neutral cash versus your contribution?
Mike Petters: Yes.
David Strauss: All right. Thanks, very much.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Burkett Huey with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Burkett Huey: Hey, thank you so much for taking the question. So I was taking a look at the awards of $1.2 billion, and if you take out the shipbuilding – I'm sorry, the servicing contracts, and I think another $100 million contract to get to about $360 million and six unmanned awards. I'm wondering, is that a good way to think about the pricing point for you've used or may not thinking about that, right?
Mike Petters: Yes. So there's a number of awards across the corporation in that value for awards. We don't get specific values to the price points of our UUVs? So yes, I wouldn't necessarily think about it that way.
Burkett Huey: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Petters for any closing remarks.
Mike Petters: Well, I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We had a good strong quarter. I'm pleased with where the leadership team is and where we're going. I hope that you and your families are able to stay safe and that you're able to encourage everyone out there to go get your shot. That's what we need right now. They are ready to get shots. So thank you all very much. We look forward to seeing you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Blake, you may now begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in the remarks today, Mike, Chris and Tom will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation, as well as our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I trust that everyone is staying healthy and safe. Now, let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.3 billion for the quarter were slightly higher than 2020. Diluted EPS was $3.68 for the quarter and pension adjusted EPS was $3.56, up from $2.43 in 2020. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $5.3 billion resulting in a record backlog of approximately $49 billion of which approximately $25 billion is funded. Chris will provide some color on a few of the key awards for the quarter during his remarks. Shifting to activities in Washington, we were pleased that the recently released summary of the fiscal year 2022 President's budget request affirm that maintaining U.S. Naval Power is critical to reassuring allies and signaling U.S. resolved to potential adversaries. Of note, the budget summary cited continued recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic-missile submarine fleet, investment in remotely operated in autonomous systems, and funding for the next generation of tax submarine program, and we look forward to understanding budget details for these and other national security priorities when that information becomes available, as well as funding levels requested for the Department of Energy and the Department of Homeland Security. We also look forward to working closely with the Congress as the FY '22 President's budget request is considered during the current legislative cycle. Regarding portfolio shaping actions during the quarter, we completed the previously announced sale of our oil and gas business and also completed the contribution of the San Diego shipyard to tighten acquisition Holdings in exchange for a non-controlling interest in this leading provider of ship repair and fleet sustainment services. Completion of these transactions sharpens the focus of our Technical Solutions business into areas where we believe are unique capabilities and close customer relationships will drive strong organic revenue growth and margin expansion. And as I prepare to close, I'm very pleased with the operating rhythm the team is achieving, which led to the third consecutive quarter of solid program execution and financial results. And I'm very confident that our strength, agility and positive momentum resulting from enduring the impacts of COVID-19 will serve as a key catalyst to help us leverage our historic backlog to generate strong free cash flow, and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers and employees. Now before I turn the call over to Chris, let me make a few comments about our recent leadership change. After serving as President of Ingalls since 2014 and with more than 40 years of service, Brian Cuccias retired on April 1. Brian's career at Ingalls has been remarkable, and HII has truly benefited from his leadership. Effective April 1, Kari Wilkinson succeeded Brian as the new President of Ingalls and will report to Chris. Kari has proven ourselves to be a strategic and visionary leader that is focused on operational excellence and I am extremely confident that Ingalls is in very capable hands. And now I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the operations. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. Operationally we had a solid quarter making consistent progress across our shipbuilding and Technical Solutions programs. With that, let me share a few key contract awards and programmatic highlights from the business segments for the quarter. At Ingalls, the team was awarded a lifecycle engineering and support services contract for the LPD program with a cumulative value of approximately $214 million. The scope of work includes engineering change management, supply chain management, training for new shipboard systems, and the execution of post-delivery availabilities. Regarding program status, LHA 8 Bougainville achieved the 25% complete milestone during the quarter. And the team remains focused on maintaining strong cost and schedule performance in support of their planned production milestones. On the DDG program, the team remains focused on preparations for launch of DDG 125 Jack H. Lucas, and sea trials for DDG-121 Frank E. Petersen Junior both planned for the second half of this year. And on the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale remains on track to complete sea trials later this year, and LPD 29, Richard M. McCool Junior remains on schedule for launch early next year. The  Ingalls is also working closely with the Navy to put LPD 32 and 33 along with LHA 9 under contract. This bundled acquisition approach is the most affordable method by the ship and when complete affords predictable savings for the Navy. At Newport News, the team was awarded a $3 billion contract for the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 74 USS John C. Stennis, and also received a contract modification for construction of the 10th Virginia-class Block 5 submarine. These key awards are additional building blocks for our record backlog, which now stands at nearly $49 billion. Shifting the program's data, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 81% complete. The team is finalizing plans to support the single phase delivery requirements, while continuing to focus on compartment completion and key initial test milestones. CVN 73 USS George Washington is approximately 87% complete and continues to make progress with the crew recently beginning to move back board the ship. This is another key milestone in support of re-delivery to the Navy plan for next year. On the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana continues to test program activities in preparation for delivery to the Navy planned for later this year. In addition, SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float off milestone as planned in the second half of this year. Our Technical Solutions that we booked several key awards during the quarter this included a $175 million fleet sustainment recompete and its position on a Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific ISR and cyber security IDIQ contract. Additionally, production of the first Orca XLUUV modules is now underway at our Unmanned Systems Center of Excellence. Approximately 75% of our structural components have been fabricated and assembly has commenced with final unit delivery to Boeing plan later this year. And finally our nuclear and environmental services business continues to perform very well with strong performance across our Department of Energy contracts on Los Alamos, Nevada and Savannah River. Now I will turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on our financials. Tom?
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Chris and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our first quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation, our first quarter revenues of $2.3 billion increase of less than 1% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily due to growth in Newport News and Ingalls that was largely offset by a decline in Technical Solutions due to divestitures associated with our portfolio shaping actions we have taken. Segment operating income for the quarter of $191 million increased $35 million from the first quarter of 2020 and segment operating margin .8.4% increased to 149 basis points. The improvement was driven by higher risk retirement at Ingalls and improved performance at Technical Solutions. Operating income for the quarter of $147 million decreased by $68 million from the first quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 6.5% percent decreased 305 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment, partially offset by the strongest segment operating results compared to the prior year. The tax rate in the quarter was approximately 15% compared to approximately 20% in the first quarter of 2020. The decline in tax rate was primarily due to the divestiture of our oil and gas business, as well as the recognition of R&D tax credit for the current year and prior periods. Net earnings in the quarter were $148 million compared to $172 million in the first quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.68 compared to $4.23 in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the impacts of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.56 compared to $2.43 in the first quarter of 2020. Turning to Slide 5 of the presentation, cash from operations was $43 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $59 million or 2.6% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of negative $16 million. This compares to cash from operations of $68 million and net capital expenditures of $66 million and free cash flow of $2 million in the first quarter of 2020. Cash contributions to our pension and other post retirement benefit plans were $72 million in the quarter, of which $60 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans. During the first quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million. As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we did reinitiate share repurchases earlier this year and continue to view the return of excess free cash flow via share repurchases as a integral part of our capital allocation strategy over the long-term. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 292,000 shares at a cost of approximately $50 million. Moving on to pension with the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we have reviewed the 5-year pension outlook that we provided on our last earnings call and continue to believe that remains the most appropriate deal. Due to the limited nature of our projected contribution and the impact of lower cash activity with Safe Harbor implementation the passage of the legislation does not have any meaningful impact on our outlook. We plan to provide an update to near-term pension expectations on our Q3 call, consistent with our product cadence. Moving on to Slide 6 of the presentation, Ingalls revenues of $649 million in the quarter increased $20 million or 3.2% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program. Ingallsâ operating income of $91 million and margin of 14% in the quarter were up from the first quarter of 2020 mainly due to higher risk retirement on LHA 8, which was related to the 25% completion milestone that Chris mentioned earlier. Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation, Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased to $66 million or 4.9% from the same period last year due to higher revenue in both aircraft carrier and submarine construction as well as fleet support services. Newport News operating income of $93 million and margin of 6.6% in the quarter were down slightly year-over-year primarily due to lower risk retirement on CVN 73 RCOH partially offset by higher risk retirement and VCS Block IV boats. Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation, Technical Solutions revenues of $259 million in the quarter decreased 18.3% from the same period last year, mainly due to the divestitures of both our oil and gas business and the San Diego shipyard on February 1 of this year, partially offset by a full quarter of results from Hydroid which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Technical Solutions operating income of $7 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $7 million in the first quarter of 2020. This was driven primarily by improved performance in defense and federal solutions and nuclear environmental services as well as a gain related to the sale of our oil and gas business. Turning to Slide 9, we continue to expect we will finish the year with shipbuilding operating margin in the 7% to 8% range with the significant remaining risk retirement events weighted towards the end of the year. In addition, we expect shipbuilding margin for the first half of 2021 to be around the midpoint of our annual guidance range. We continue to view the remainder of our 2021 guidance as appropriate with the exception of the effective tax rate which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Now I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Tom. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator:  The first question comes from Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland: Mike, I wondered if you could expand. I mean it's been quite a string of challenges thrown out over the last several quarters. But the comment you made around the operating rhythm and finding I guess more of a better cadence there. I wondered if you could expand on that, and specifically what sort of operating metrics you're looking at that give you conviction that that's a trend you're going to stay on.
Michael Petters: Okay, I think first of all, Carter you're right. We've had a lot of we got a lot of stuff thrown at us in the last 12 months. And we took a pretty good body blow back a year ago with attendance and relative to the pandemic and the impact that had on our ability to retire risk. We recognized that in Q2, but what came out of that was. We've stabilized our employment levels. We've stabilized our scheduling. We've actually created the mechanisms in our risk register so that we know where we are and where we're going and where we need to get. It helps a lot that we have this backlog that we're working off of and where we are now is that - when you come through a crisis like this as a leadership team the connectivity, the tools that you've put in place, the innovation that has happened. You're taking advantage of all of that and as you move forward you start to look at what we actually accomplished. While we started at the beginning of the pandemic thinking that we needed to preserve 25,000 people. We have just hired over the last five years in our workforce. We've done that. We actually have hired between 5,000 and 6,000 people since the pandemic started that's pretty creative and innovative, if you will. And that's, and we still have pretty robust hiring plans going forward. Our case rates today are lower than they have been since last summer that's inside of our yard and the quarantine volume today is lower than it's been, really since this began. We have actually administered vaccines to we've administered vaccines to about a third of our workforce on top of where - they're widely available to the rest of the employees who are getting them not to us. And so, we're seeing a pretty steady rhythm now our folks are at work there engaged. We understand what needs to be done and we're actually getting stuff done. I think the change, where we moved Chris over to be the Chief Operating Officer and really create more management bandwidth on how do we manage that risk going forward and how do we make sure that we're doing what we said we were going to do has really helped. And so I don't know, I guess I've been around for a long time, but I feel really good about where we are right now in terms of doing what we said we're going to do.
Carter Copeland: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up is - obviously a lot of talk macro wise about inflation and inflationary impacts, when you look at, at least in terms of your fixed-price work. Is there any cost exposure that you watch there to be aware of or is it not significant at this point? How should we think about that?
Michael Petters: Yes, I may let Tom take that one. And let him talk to you about what we're seeing there.
Tom Stiehle: Good morning, Carter. Yes, so relative to inflation, our contracts they are much longer term. We have the benefit here with long lead contracts and from a planning horizon and the backlog that we have to plan our work out. So, we have a site as far as the materials that we need additionally, where we put together our proposals and the contracts that we bring home. We generally want to see those POs in place. Theyâre backstopped by proposals and commitments shortly - they are after the award. So what we're seeing, I've talked about yards just this week as matter fact at that point. We're not seeing tremendous amount of inflation across the purchases that we have. And weâre not having a problem feeding yards from a material perspective. We do see going forward as we're getting new quotes that the span of the validity of the quote is short. I think the contractors are staying light on their feet as far as what they are committing to, but relative to our contracts and our performance, we don't see an impact right now.
Operator: We take the next question from the line of Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: I was hoping, Chris you could clarify that LPD bundled contracts you mentioned the size, timing and if that is more to just generate efficiencies or could there actually be increased levels of work versus your medium-term plan as well?
Chris Kastner: Yes, so that's all kind of contained in the 3% guidance that we talked about from a growth standpoint. The benefits of the bundle are pretty clear, when you can order those three ships together and sequence the work in an efficient manner. You're going to absolutely get savings. So it's something we support, it's something we're working very closely with the Navy. If we are not able to get that, we'll get those ships under contract incrementally it just will not be as efficient.
Myles Walton: What would be the size - of a bundle of those three?
Chris Kastner: 5.5 billion potentially.
Myles Walton: Okay. And there is a clarification for Tom. The sequential margin in 2Q given the 1H is expected to be at the midpoint of the range. Can you point to maybe why the step down is so significant to six mid-sixes or so?
Tom Stiehle: Sure, as I related in my comments, opening comments there, there's not a tremendous amount of milestones that we have in Q2, Q3, it's just a pacing year right now. So we're watching the volume come through at the present booking rates that we have right now. We think the first half of the year will come in around the midpoint of the guidance. And then we have milestones in the back half of the year, that - if retired have some potential there, but obviously we have to burn that off as the year kick by.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: We've seen a whole lot of Navy shipbuilding plans at the 500 plus versions and the C&L appears to have gone back to kind of 355 ship goal, but even that goal has been not easy to get to and the mix appears very uncertain. So Mike when you think about planning in this environment. How do you think about long-term investments and where you want to sit given all of the flux around these shipbuilding plans?
Michael Petters: Thanks, Doug. That's a great question when we actually kind of kick around a lot is, are we thinking about this the right way. I think at a macro kind of at the higher level what we see is that the shipbuilding execution plan is on a much longer rhythm then the shipbuilding theoretical plans like a 30-year plan comes out, I don't know every couple of years. But the contracts we have ships right now that are under contract to deliver. I mean Doris Miller deliveries in 2032. So what is that like four 30-year plans between now and then. So we look at those plans, not so much as the precision of the plan, but more about what's the intent of the plan. And what we're seeing in the intent of the plan you've acknowledged that they move around a little bit, but what we see in those movements is maybe wants to move to a Navy that has many ships, faster ships, maybe smaller ships, cheaper ships. So our investments are aimed in that direction. Now that doesn't mean they are not going to build aircraft carriers or submarines, because I think they are, but they're going to want to build aircraft carriers more efficiently. They're going to want to build submarines more efficiently. They want to build more submarines more efficiently. When it comes to the non-nuclear ships amphibs, destroyers, frigates those kinds of platforms go. They either go through class change or block changes and our challenge is to be agile enough to respond to the customers' requirements, and do that as effectively and efficiently as we can. So the investments we make in our facilities are designed to be able to do that. There are multipurpose, multi-product kinds of investments. We'll do a capital investment at Ingalls that will apply to four classes of ships. Weâll do capital investments at Newport News that you can use for carriers or submarines, and so that's kind of the way we think about that as opposed to, we need to go make a big investment for pick your program that three years from now may evaporate. We don't do that. So that's kind of the way we sized and thought about this generational investment we made over the past five years or so, a couple of billion dollars in our shipyards. We think that positions us very, very well for the direction that we think the Navy is going to end up going. And we'll probably have lots of discussion about whether it's one more submarine or one less destroyer all that sort of thing, but it means our investments were still the right thing to do.
Douglas Harned: And do you think, when you look forward as you're saying more you know faster ships, slower ships, in a sense, it can open it up to other competitors rather first you and general dynamics and we saw this with the frigate LCS. I mean, do you foresee a time obviously it's a ways away when the - competitive structure of this industry could change because of the smaller faster different ships?
Michael Petters: I don't know, Doug, I guess maybe, but I would say that I would caution anybody from thinking about that question is a binary question that it's either one or the other. It's going to be - kind of a transformation, that's going to be product line specific. Most of the shipyards in this country build a product. Our shipyards build - several classes. We build four classes of ships at Ingalls. We build carriers and submarines at Newport News and refueling and all that sort of thing. So we do multiple classes of ships in our shipyards. We think that serves us pretty well for whatever direction the future is going to be, and if the environment is going to be more competitive. So be it. We're happy to compete.
Operator: The next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Can we talk a little bit or maybe about the services business, the margins in the quarter were maybe about 2.7% and the target margins were 3% to 5%. What drives the upside there? How are you thinking about that?
Tom Stiehle: Yes, I'll take that hey Ron. It's Tom here. So a couple of things, we have got it from 3%, 5%. You're right, it is 2.7% quarter. Right now, we saw a little bit of volume shortfall there as we're waiting for awards and the sales to come along with those awards for the year. Just with COVID and the announcements of where we are and some recompetes, itâs just a little bit - behind relative to guidance of 3% to 5%, but the year still in front of us, we haven't changed our guidance, we think TS will be at year's end.
Chris Kastner: Ron, I can add to that. There is - in our equity accounting relative to the nuclear space, the timing of some of those are slated towards second and fourth quarter. So you see - you donât generally see that happening in the first quarter. So it's a bit lumpy, and we usually start light.
Ron Epstein: And then a question for Mike. When you're looking out medium term, let's call it, what are the biggest opportunities that you're trying to plan for now. I mean this is a follow-on to Doug's question as you're positioning the business, what's the big fish out there that you want to catch say call it three, four or five years out?
Michael Petters: So in shipbuilding, I think that we'll start with that. I think that if there is an expansion of a product line say and there has been some discussion about what's the industry's ability to support expansion of say, the submarine product line. We certainly want to be able to take full advantage of that. In the same way, if the Navy wants to expand in the frigate space we want to be able to assist that if we need to be able to go and do that. And then I think it's - engagement on the planning and design piece for. So what happens to the future of amphibs probably that's mid to long-term, probably not near to mid-term. And what happens with the carrier is, are there going to be CVN 82 going to have some design for affordability put to it and are we going to engage in that. I mean frankly CVN 82 is a ship that starts to show up here, I mean it's - you got a contract in 27 or 28. So making sure that that stays on track that's come of the way we think about it in shipbuilding. In the Technical Solutions space, we've made a big investment in unmanned and expansion of the unmanned business I think is something that. Now that we made that investment and we have a portfolio, it's up to us to make sure that we capture that expansion. Of all the budget items that I see out there, the unmanned budget item is probably going to have the largest percentage growth over the next five in my view. We've established - as Chris kind of alluded to a minute ago, we've established our position as a department of energy prime and there is a lot of work over there that needs to be done and we are pursuing all of that very aggressively. We think that's a really great spot for us to be in takes advantage of capability that we have in our shipbuilding business, but it gives access to another customer, and we've done very well with that and we look to continue to expand that. And then ISR space, where we've really actually done well and we expect to do well going forward. So we kind of look at that it's kind of capability dependent based on what our customersâ needs for capability are, but that's kind of how we think about it. Where do we think our customers are going to want to be in three to five years and how do we make sure we get there and help them get there.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes - Tom if you could provide the EACâs and is it fair that the pickup on the LHA 8 was probably $35 million or so?
Tom Stiehle: So a little bit, good morning, George a little bit color on that is, 86 was the up - was the favorable 36 is down net 50 across the yards about 9010 at Ingalls. Only significant drivers on the upside there were the LHA 8, we usually don't give guidance or information on the specific ship so 35 kind of heavy there. Ingallsâ had a good quarter on top of the LHA 8 hitting the 25% vessel complete milestone where they reevaluate the risk and they re-strike the EAC. We did have a change proposal that definitize they have been focused our cost management there so overall it was a good quarter for Ingalls. There was no - the significant upsides or downsides that I probably highlight here.
George Shapiro: Tom if 35 is a little bit heavy I mean just on the rough numbers you gave it would imply about $45 million of favorable at Ingalls. So was there anything else you can specify or its all spread across the board for say another $20 million if 30 was the LHA 8?
Tom Stiehle: Yes, the Q has the information on LHA 8. So we're not  you'll see that you're about $10 million heavy. But as I say, the other aspects of it change management. We've definitize the change down there not only significant. And then just a good performance in LPD 28 is coming along and paying attention on cost. 14% high so I wouldn't expect that going forward, but they cleaned up well, and they didnât get bit for the quarter so that's where he landed.
George Shapiro: And one quick one for Mike, can you update us on the Block V submarines I mean that was the one that you've had some problems with this to where we stand right now?
Michael Petters: Actually, the challenge we had in Q2 was on Block IV, George. And we've got a rhythm in Block we're establishing a rhythm in Block IV, that's going to carry through and help us do really well on Block V. So I don't know Chris if you want to add to that.
Chris Kastner: I can add on Block IV we hit some important milestones in the first quarter with Montana floating off and New Jersey getting pressure hull complete through important milestones on the balance of the year there for VCS Block IV getting Montana deliver and getting New Jersey floated off. So we're watching those milestones very closely. Good progress online channel I am getting ready for delivery. So we're optimistic on kind of the rhythm and the momentum on the Block IV contract right now.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Safran from Seaport Global. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: So Iâve just been doing reading about the work. I wanted to ask you about the forward. I've been reading about the work being done there based on that. Newport still doing work on things like the weapons elevators and there are other maintenance items, et cetera? I just want to know if you could discuss how the work on the Ford is progressing relative to your expectations, when you expect completion and if there's been any commentary from the Navy about the level of satisfaction with you efforts so far?
Chris Kastner: Yes, this is Chris. And I'll let our ex-aircraft carrier program manager Mike talked about it after me. But yes, really positive interaction with the Navy on the Ford weekly interaction on the Ford, especially on the weapons elevators got seven of those turned over Ford will be done this summer so really positive interaction that work will go on for a while, but nothing not really material going forward, but yes it's been positive. The Newport News team is performing very well and I think the Navy is very pleased with the performance of that ship right now.
Michael Petters: And I'll just add the Ford at sea as much as probably more than any other ship in the fleet last year. It's the training carrier for the East Coast and the Navy would will say and they have said they can quote you the number of Traps the number of launches. The number - the tons of ordnance that they've moved on the weapons elevators how easy it is to operate, how much power density changes from the Nimitzâs class. I mean it is a centerpiece of the design is a centerpiece of the Navy strategy going forward and the ship is coming together really well. I mean getting ready to go towards their shock trial so all systems at our green and full speed ahead.
Richard Safran: Okay, and now I'd like to go - revisit this comment you talked about your comments you were making about the future, the Navy fleet. It was one program I think that was omitted and maybe it was deliberate and there was talk of a replacement for the Ticonderoga was kind of wondering if you could just comment on the status of that program? I mean if you think that will ever materialize to a real opportunity. Or for example do you think that Flight III was  is what you think is going to replace the Tyco's?
Michael Petters: I'm not sure I know how to handicap that one of the first things I learned at the Academy 40 years ago was that there is countermeasures and then there's counter, countermeasures and there's counter, counter, countermeasures. And what happens is the technology races ahead at a speed that's lot different than the build cycle of a ship. And so the question is what kind of platform. You're going to need to work technology. If you look at the Flight III destroyer and you look at what they're trying to do with it that ship is pretty full. And so is there a - if the technology is going to require that kind of space and weight than it probably need something different to carry it forward. How we get there as an industry to design that and create a platform that has the margin, if you will for future technological upgrades. I think the Navy is - and the industry are having a pretty robust discussion about that right now. And I'm not sure I'm ready to handicap how it's going to turn out.
Operator: The next question comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Just going back to the pace of margin through the year topic and the risk retirement and how they flow through. The shipbuilding margin if I take out the net positive EAC in a lot of your history is in the zone of 6.5% and the different guidance comments you've provided for first half and full-year sort of implies second half 2Q, 3Q and then stepping up in 4Q? So I guess, it implies essentially no risk retirement events 2Q, 3Q actually maybe even embedding something slightly negative. Just want to make sure that's what you're looking for. And I have that correct?
Michael Petters: Yes, I'd tell you, we are in the zone Noah so between 6% and 7% will be the norm, a 6.5% is a good estimate on your part. I tell you that the mix moves around at both yards as far as where the ships are so as ships get either sold off or mature when they take a step up and/or you have new ships that's spotted lower booking rate that mix changes. I wouldn't read too much into that where we need to be from a plan perspective and against our guidance that we gave you there. So yes, I think you got that right.
Noah Poponak: Makes sense, and Tom when you look to next year in 2022, do you have more risk retirement events or less or a similar amount?
Tom Stiehle: So we told you 7%, 8% this year low 8% next year. We had mentioned that I can go forward and then Chris gave the guidance for Q4 in February, had mentioned that hey this is a pacing year and then as we get into 2022 and 2023 we'll see more ship deliveries. So there is the potential there and the plan has this moving upward. And obviously, as the quarters kind of click off or burn down that risk and we'll realize those margin expansion that we discussed.
Noah Poponak: And then just a clarification on the ARPA into pension, cash flow inputs do the contribution and CAS recovery numbers you provided previously literally not change at all or it's just that those had come down enough that the change is going to be small relative to your total cash flows?
Tom Stiehle: Yes, it seems significant as far the change if you do the math - there is something there, but - we really don't want to chase it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Since we strong over to Safe Harbor we really kind of mitigated the CAS variability and already we're at a limited contributions over the projection that Chris gave in February again. The mac contribution was $80 million half of that post retirement benefits. So and then also obviously the projections on pension it's going to be equally a function the discount rate is that changes and the plant performance, between those three variables. We're not going to update as recorded here. We'll give you a look see at Q3, that's the normal cadence for the remainder of the year in 2022. And then as 2021 closes out we will give you a fresh look at a 5-year projection next February.
Operator: The next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Mike, you touched on the unmanned portfolio and the potential growth there and a couple of your comments. Could you size the revenue  in revenue now that sits within TS what a reasonable kind of target for that business could be over the next couple of years. And when you would think about actually breaking it out, so we can see what's going on there?
Michael Petters: Yes, we have a broken that out yet. And so we'll just, we'll let you know when we're ready to break it out.
David Strauss: Okay. I guess in the first quarter. You did, you had 5% growth at Newport, 3% at Ingalls you're forecasting shipbuilding relatively flat top a little bit this year and 3% from here. How should we think about the relative growth rate of new perb versus Ingalls both this year and into the future?
Chris Kastner: Yes, this is Chris. We don't break out the growth rate by the two shipyards. We have historically said that Ingalls is more flattish moving forward and a lot of the growth is coming from Newport News, but we don't give specific growth rates.
David Strauss: Okay, see if I can hit on one here the R&D amortization Tom what potential impact. Could you guys be looking at there, if that holds?
Tom Stiehle: Yes, so the opinion that we have on that is not constructive to - from an investment standpoint and R&D if I have to amortize over five years. So we'll have to see how that legislation flows out. We have run some models on that. It's not a tremendous impact it does obviously affect the cash on it. I mean our model say, it could be in the 50-ish range $50 million to $100 million range, and we'll have to see how that legislation unfolds.
David Strauss: Okay $50 million to $100 million on annualized cash flow in 2020?
Tom Stiehle: Right, you got to amortize it over five years. Those credits and that's an evaluation we do annually against the portfolio that we have so.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Gautam Khanna: I have a question on, good morning, guys. Question on the National Security Cutter program any change in the Biden administration the desire to keep bind these, what should we be looking for 2022 request what's on your contract if you could just refresh us on that?
Michael Petters: Yes, we're pushing hard to get NSC 12 appropriated. I think it's kind of like the Navy side where we're kind of living off of the works done on the FY 2022 budget, before this administration got here. And I think the administration now is doing a kind of a top to bottom review of all of that stuff. That's why frankly for DoD you've just seen the top line number come out with not any details behind it. Our view is there is a lot of strong support for the National Security Cutter. The Coast Guard - is gainfully using that platform around the world and we're proud to be able to partner with them to get it done and we're going to continue to pursue it.
Chris Kastner: Yes, Gautam I could add we've delivered through nine, as you're probably aware 11 kind of 11 on the production there at Ingalls 11 delivers on the 2024 timeframe. As Mike indicated very capable ship and we're working with the Coast Guard for potentially and the Congress to get 12 on the contract.
Gautam Khanna: Okay, understood any discussion of additional Block V resource, this 12 sort of the end of the line on that program?
Michael Petters: I think we'll see. I think we're just a lot of new players are coming to the table to have a discussion around it. We're happy to provide whatever requirement the nation needs in that platform.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And I may have missed it in your opening remarks, but where are we in terms of staffing at the shipyards people showing up like level of absenteeism and/or from COVID where is that?
Michael Petters: Yes, we're at normal levels. Yes, we are at normal levels now. I mean, we have our lowest case rates since last summer. We have the fewest number of people in quarantine since last summer. Our third of our workforce, we've actually vaccinated one-third of the workforce. And the workforce is getting vaccinations in other places as well. And so what that's doing is that's just driving our case rates down pretty dramatically. We hired 6,000 people during the pandemic, our hiring plans continue and. And so, we're moving ahead, we expect that by 1st of June, the people in our shipyards that have - that want to get the vaccine will have had access to get it. And so, we're moving ahead.
Gautam Khanna: And last one from me, just curious, is there any precedent for the bundled purchase that you were talking about which maybe LHA and LPD been put together was a bundle across different ship classes, contracting?
Chris Kastner: We had a competition a few years ago where the competition was around and LHA and a TAO. And we won the LHA, and our friends at NASCO won the TAOs. So we've been building ships in this country for over 200 years. I would say that there is probably precedent for just about everything that's out there.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Chris, this one's for you. I wanted to ask in your new role. I think one of the things that you're tackling is just moving up the best practices from one yard to the other, maybe across all three businesses. And I was hoping you could expand on that a little bit talk about where the opportunities are within that?
Chris Kastner: Yes, no that's a really good question. I do, I have had the opportunity to work at Ingalls as a CFO there. And then my corporate CFO job reviewing all the processes at Newport News. And there are significant things that happen within each of the yards and even internal solutions that can be shared. One example I can give is supply chain, the supply chain teams work very closely with each other. They bundle procurements, they look at capacity across the spectrum and they do a very good job at that, their operating systems are a bit different, but they learn from each other, and we bring best practices in the operating systems as well. So I can talk for days on the things we're working on across shipbuilding and within Technical Solutions to learn from each other. But those are just a few of them.
Robert Spingarn: I think on one of our visits, one of the things we saw at Newport News was the implementation of VR - sort of to replace physical blueprints as an example of where technology can come in. Is there an update on how well that's implemented and if you're actually using that yet or if there are other technologies we're talking about?
Chris Kastner: Yes, so another good question. Digital is absolutely being utilized within Newport News and building a CVN 80 - it's preparing for utilization on the Columbia class. So it's absolutely an investment we're making. It's paying off the craft and the traits like the new product and we're hoping for really great things to come from that.
Robert Spingarn: As anyone quantified the benefit, have you seen at least in testing percentage of man-hours reduced or anything like that?
Chris Kastner: We have definitely seen a percent increase in savings. We haven't published anything to that regard. It's just at the beginning stages on 80. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but we are achieving savings yes.
Operator: The next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joseph DeNardi: Just to clarify Carter's question maybe more specifically when you think about an inflationary environment what protections do you have and then where are the risk - and understand you're not seeing anything right now. But to the extent, we do see that where are you protected and where the risks?
Tom Stiehle: Thanks, Joseph. So I just said early on that. Our contracts are a little bit more long-term and say across other industries. We do have the planning cycle long lead on our contracts. We usually our process here as we want to make sure that we have as much material understood on the quote. So when we go on award, the risk of inflation hitting, our handshake values is low on that. Additionally as contracts run out, there are some contracts here with the carriersâ six to seven or eight years, and we bought the material much further where it's tough to get that quote. We still have EPA, indices and pricing bands with the customer that we share in both the potential on the run or the overrun in that. And then obviously these contracts FBIâs so there is some sharing there. But like more immediate as we post right now for the execution of the contracts that we're working today. We don't see that right. I mean there is pockets here and there a piece of material that may be late. But on the whole material is being flown into the yard at the expected times and expectation of costs that the contracts that send it around. So hope that hit the answer to your question.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay yes, that's helpful. And then Mike, when you look at 80, 81 and 82, can you talk about the degree of commonality you're expecting from those ships, does the Block Buy ensure greater commonality, so that maybe you can benefit more from serial production. When you think about the opportunity to improve margins on carrier construction, how important is maybe more commonality or - is it something very different than that? Thank you.
Michael Petters: Yes, so 80 and 81 are the two ships under contract. 82 is the ship that's out there, Chris alluded to my ancient history as being a program manager. I was actually a program manager for the Stennis and Truman, which was the last time we've built two ships at the same time. I can tell you that the second ship absolutely benefits from the first ship in the way that the teams move from one platform to the next. The learning curves are there. It's kind of hard to think about learning curves on ships that deliver four or five years apart, but they actually it's real. And as you get to the second ship you have well trained crews, who have been through this who are working through it, who are capturing lessons and they are carrying lessons learned with them into that platform. Then the trick will be how do you take what we've learned at 81 and make sure that you do that with 82 and what that means is 82 is got to be on time. If you delay 82, and I've seen this over my whole career, you start spreading these things back out, you start breaking those learning curves. So what 80, 81 means is that you're going to get great efficiency there. I think the Navy advertised $4 billion of efficiency across the enterprise, which that's pretty significant. If you spread that out and you delay 82 and you push it out, you're going to start to cut into that efficiency pretty dramatically. That's what happened after Stennis and Truman of 74 and 75, really came together very nicely. Then we kind of push 76 out to the right a little bit. And then we push 77 out to the right a little bit. And then we push 78 out to the right a little bit. And so all of that we're trying to capture that back. And I would, no surprise, I would argue that the next carrier contract should also be a two-ship by 82 and 83. So but that's just me.
Operator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time, I would now like to hand the call back over to Petters for any closing remarks.
Michael Petters: Well, thanks for that and thanks for joining us today, and we certainly hope that you and your families are all staying safe and our healthy in this environment as we kind of come through the pandemic. But one final thought for you all, as I'd like to direct your attention to our Investor Relations page on our website, and take a look at our corporate sustainability report. We've been doing a lot of work over many years around these kinds of issues related to sustainability. But we've collected all of that and created a virtual report for you to take a look at, and it's only been up there. I don't know over couple of months, and it's a pretty dynamic presentation, but I'm very proud of what this company does relative to our communities, relative for our employees, for their families, for our customers. I'm very proud of what we do and how we do it, and this is a chance for us to kind of brag about a little bit. So if you get a chance take a look at that. And as always, I appreciate your and we appreciate your interest in our company. Your engagement with us and any feedback that you have, and we look forward to seeing you again soon. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-11 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2020 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call.  I would now like to hand the call over to Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Blake, you may begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I trust that everyone is staying healthy and safe. So before getting into the results for the quarter and the full-year, let me take a few moments to reflect on last year. 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging business environments that we've ever had to navigate. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made decisions that are focused on the safety and well-being of our employees and I could not be more proud of the way our team responded to the challenges. While enduring the difficulties and uncertainties of the pandemic, we demonstrated an uncompromising commitment to safety, quality, cost and schedule that allowed us to achieve significant milestones on our programs and continue making meaningful contributions to national security. Specifically during 2020, we delivered three ships, the amphibious assault ship USS Tripoli, the guided missile destroyer USS Delbert Black and the National Security Cutter Stone. We also christened Virginia-class attack submarine Montana and we laid the keel for Massachusetts. Now consistent with the strategy outlined during our Investor Day meeting last February, we continue to invest in unmanned and autonomy capabilities. We acquire hydroid and established a strategic alliance with Kongsberg Maritime. We broke ground on the Unmanned Systems Center of Excellence in Hampton and closed the year by acquiring the autonomy business of Special Integrated Systems, an industry leader in unmanned surface vessels solutions.
Chris Kastner: Thanks Mike and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our fourth quarter and full-year results and also provide some additional information on how we view 2021 and our longer-term outlook. Beginning with our consolidated fourth-quarter results on Slide four of the presentation, our fourth quarter revenues of $2.8 billion increased 14.3% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to growth at Newport News driven by increased material volume for CVN 80 and CVN 81 and higher volumes for the planning effort for the RCOH of CVN 74, as well as higher volumes for the Columbia and Virginia class submarine program. Operating income for the quarter of $305 million increased by $119 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 and operating margin of 11.1% increased 335 basis points. These increases were primarily driven by higher risk retirement across numerous Ingalls programs and improved performance and technical solutions, primarily due to fourth quarter 2019 results that included an asset impairment related to our oil and gas business as well the loss on the fleet support contract. Fourth quarter 2020 results also included a more favorable operating FatCats adjustment. Moving on to consolidated results for the full year on Slide five, revenues were $9.4 billion for the year an increase of 5.2% from 2019. The increase was driven by growth across all segments including higher aircraft carrier submarine and fleet support revenues at Newport News, higher surface combatant and amphibious assault ship revenues at Ingalls and the inclusion of hydroid in technical solutions results.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up. So we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: We’ll now begin our question-and-answer session.  Our first question today will come from Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: Thanks, and good morning.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Jonathan Raviv: And also congrats to Chris and Tom, looking forward to it. Can you clarify Chris, just on the 7% to 8% in 2021, how much net negative is in there from COVID type impacts, I mean you mentioned I think in the slides that you're not expecting much in terms of reimbursement. And then also just thinking about kind of like the improvement thereafter, the low rates, is that assuming no reimbursements? So yes, just the first question on that net COVID impact?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, so we don't expect any reimbursement within our guidance related to the COVID impact. Again, I split that kind of into two buckets. One is material, which is the cleaning sort of expense that will eventually get through and there'll be some upside to that, but I don't think it's material, and then delay and disruption. So there's really no negative performance impact assumed in the 7% to 8%.
Jonathan Raviv: Okay, and then just turning to capital deployment, you’re resuming repo on 1Q, you've done a couple of things in TS over the years, mostly smaller, mostly smaller items. I mean, but also a year ago you talked about expanding TS and the real focus being there, lots of activity in that TS type market. What kind of things you're looking for in terms of capability or size? And to what extent has the pandemic or what your Navy customers saying or quite frankly your stock price changed the math around what option you find more attractive than another when it comes to capital deployment?
Michael Petters: Yes, so first of all, starting with where we think the opportunities are, we continue to see opportunity in the unmanned space whether that's a technology capture or portfolio expansion, we’re just kind of keeping our eyes open on how do we make sure that we've got the right footprint of capabilities and the right portfolio to go support where we think the Navy might be going. We believe that our energy business, our Department of Energy business, and our nuclear operations business is finding its stride very well. And we think that there's great opportunity there especially in environmental management moving forward, so we're kind of watching that very, very closely right now. And the support for the federal government across all the rest of our solutions with Cyber and IT, we've demonstrated now, we know how to run that business. And so we're watching that. That's a pretty dynamic space right now and valuations are kind of challenging. And so we're still going to continue to think about what are the capability sets that we need, as opposed to how big do we need to be? And that's kind of the way we're thinking about it going forward.
Christopher Kastner: Yes, Jonathan, I could add, I consider it really kind of a back to normalcy from a capital deployment standpoint, we're finishing our capital program that we think has been very successful over the last few years. The dividend will be increased but more modestly going forward, and then we're going to be very opportunistic in share buyback, and then evaluate the markets and opportunities as Mike indicated.
Jonathan Raviv: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning gentlemen and congrats on the moves. The promotion, Chris and welcome, Tom.
Christopher Kastner: Thanks, Carter. Good morning.
Carter Copeland: Just a couple, could you tell us the anticipated timing on the delivery of New Jersey? Is that a second half ‘22 event and then just with respect to the various programs outside of Montana and New Jersey, are there any other boats that you would consider significantly below the company average margin at this point?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, so Carter, I really don't want to comment on individual ship margins but New Jersey is mid to late in 2022.
Carter Copeland: Okay. And then Chris, just as a clarification as always, can you give us the EAC’s favorable and unfavorable for the quarter?
Christopher Kastner: Sure, positive was 88, negative 42 for net, 46, over 90% of that net was Ingalls, Ingalls had a very good Q4 with delivery of NSC-9 and then LPD 28 and 29 are performing very well down there at Ingalls.
Carter Copeland: Okay, great. Thank you for the color. I'll let somebody else ask.
Christopher Kastner: Sure, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning, two quick ones. One is on the volume side. Obviously, we baseline them higher since the summer for both ‘20, which achieved in ‘21. And just curious where the upside, you're seeing most pronounced and then secondly, Chris, I know that your challenge you were anticipating was being able to walk people out in ‘21 cash flow and then back up the hill in ‘22. Can you give us a sense, we can add all the other items, but give us a sense of the swing in working capital that's embedded sort of in your expectation over those couple of years? Thanks.
Christopher Kastner: Yes, so let's start with volume, 80 and 81 had some material volume that showed up in 2020, that we’re planning around the end of the year, so we had some upside there. And then ‘21 is just simply a function of our plans getting complete, our labor showing up and being confident in our labor forecast for 2021 and working through the backlog. From a cash standpoint, you're right, we gave you pretty much all the information going from ‘20 to ‘21, and then ‘20 to ‘22 actually. So I'll start with ‘20 to ’21, its pension and the CARES Act working capital. Capital is about the same. And then when you go ‘21 to ‘22, it just simply reverses the pension actually is a bit of a tailwind. And then you get some working capital help, I don't want to cite a specific number. But we've done very well in working capital, we'll continue to do that. Remember, we do have significant deliveries in 2022. We have four ships that are going to deliver, so it'll be helped there. So we think it's a natural lift from ‘21 to ‘22, based on the information that we provided our ship deliveries, which will drive working capital, and then our natural lift in our top and bottom line. So I think that'll get you there from a free cash standpoint, we think it's pretty logical and pretty obvious when you go through the modeling.
Myles Walton: One clarification the footnote on Slide 6 talks about the advances you got from the progress payments, but it talks about the suppliers being accelerated as well. Was that a net push or a net positive to 2020?
Christopher Kastner: It's a net positive.
Myles Walton: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: I'm wondering about if you look out it and the growth, and you talk about the sort of 3% annually over the course of the plan and in shipbuilding. And with the higher 2020 and the midpoint of the 2021 guidance, that's a lower number for 2021. I guess is the implication that it's 3-ish percent in the remaining years of the plan. Is it the implication that the carrier would be sort of 3%, including the sub-3% year in ‘21? How do you think about that kind of growth forecast?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, so remember we did have that material acceleration from ‘21 to ‘20. So, net-net, it doesn't really impact our total outlook. We think long-term next five to seven to 10 years actually were 3% growth business in shipbuilding, it's going to be lumpy from year-to-year, but long-term, it's 3%.
Seth Seifman: Okay, even up to 10 years or so?
Christopher Kastner: Sure. Yes, I mean think about the backlog we have, there were discussions that potentially because of the budget increases, that the Navy had that we would be growing in excess of what we’re now, we've consistently said that 3% is probably the right way to think about the business.
Seth Seifman: Okay. And then following-up on that, I think the headcount for the year seemed like it was about flattish, if we think about that 3% growth rate over kind of the long-term, how do you think about headcount growth over that period?
Michael Petters: Well, I think the first thing to, you almost have to go back to the previous universe, we hired almost 25,000 people before the pandemic in an environment where there was as low as 3% unemployment. So we know how to create workforce it’s frankly, probably the most significant core competency of our shipbuilding enterprises as getting workforce created since the pandemic started, I guess in March, we still hired about 3,000 people. And so we believe and have a lot of confidence in our ability to expand our workforce where we need to, we're pretty good at throttling the pace of that. And we're actually exceptional, I believe at training that workforce. So, I think that there will be workforce expansion that that coincides with the growth in the business. But we think that's well within our capacity to do that. And frankly, we're probably ahead of many folks in the industry right now in terms of having already hired a lot of those folks. So we're on our way.
Seth Seifman: Great, thank you very much.
Michael Petters: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes. Good morning, Chris, you’ve guided to $7.9 billion for shipbuilding revenues in Q3. And obviously, it wound up to a lot higher than that. And the business, that's pretty predictable. Can you tell us what happened to give you that much stronger growth than what you expected?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, thanks, George. As I mentioned previously, CVN 80 and 81 has some material that was due right around the end of the year, and it accelerated into 2020. So unfortunately, we can be a bit lumpy at times, we're pretty good at forecasting our labor and our labor demand, and how we're going to end-up from a labor standpoint, the material can catch you a bit, you got large items that can deliver towards the end of the year. And it just showed up in December, which had higher than our expectations.
George Shapiro: Okay, and then one for you, Mike. The Senate just approved tax for the Deputy Secretary. I mean, she's been kind of outspoken and not being a big fan of carriers. Could you just give us your color. Is it how you think this will shake out and with the new administration?
Michael Petters: Well, I think leading George it’s a great question, and we could probably talk about this all day. But I think, we're starting from a place where the previous administration was looking at what's going on in the world, and had come to the conclusion that the Navy needed some priority in terms of budget allocation, and resources. If anything, I think what's going on in the world probably, since the Election probably just reinforces that view. New players will look at that differently. And they may have a different set of priorities. But at the end of the day, our principal role here is to support the Navy and whatever it is that they need to go to deal and support our National Security. So that's what we'll do, particularly around aircraft carriers, I think the value of the carrier and the capability of the carrier is well understood by everybody in the industry. And we'll see how that all plays out. But we like the work that we're doing. We're very proud of the ships that we're producing. Ford is a tremendous ship right now, where it's been providing training, support and demonstrating all the new technologies. I believe the Navy could tell you that it's been at sea as much as any other ship in the Navy last year. And so I think, I think the carrier is in a good place right now relative to how the Navy is thinking about what they need for our National Security needs going forward. But that doesn't mean anything about the rest of our portfolio. I mean, we really have strong offerings and strong parts of our portfolio that supports the broad range of Navy requirements, whether it's submarines or amphibs, or destroyers. If the Navy is going to be a priority in our National Security posture going forward, then we're going to be right in there with them.
George Shapiro: Okay, thanks very much.
Michael Petters: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning.
Michael Petters: Good morning, Doug.
Douglas Harned: At Ingalls, you're right in the transition to Flight III on the DDGs and Flight IIs on the LPDs. Can you describe the differences with DDG 125, LPD 30. I mean should we expect any pressure on performance as you move to these new ships?
Michael Petters: Yes, I think it's a good question, Doug. But the whole point of the way, the Navy worked with us to make those transitions has been to try to do that as gracefully as possible. Yes, DDG 125 is the first Flight III ship, but they've been actually incrementally inserting Flight III technologies into the ships ahead of that. And so trying to make that as graceful as possible I think will pay big dividends. And as far as the LPDs go and go into Flight II, there's I mean just the fact that we're doing LPD Flight II is that is a punctuation on that statement that they made it graceful, instead of going off and doing a whole new class design and starting all over, you just basically took the LPD Flight I and then you rescoped it, to do Flight II and that's definitely in our wheelhouse. And so we feel pretty good about both of those, we actually think it was very thoughtful on the Navy's part to do it that way, with the LPDs, it was the Navy and the Marine Corps that did that. And we think that's the advantage of that, that's the Navy's understanding of taking advantage of production, as opposed to going back to the blackboard and starting all over and trying to redesign it from the ground up. In both of those cases, you're going to get significantly improved capability at significantly reduced or significantly better affordability in a lot faster timeframe. I think that's the wave of the future. And it's in some ways, it's a throwback to the past, because that's how we used to do it. So I think we're going to be fine there.
Douglas Harned: Well, and then just staying in operations. If you look at Newport News, if we go back early in the year, when you face challenges on the Montana and New Jersey, Massachusetts, you talked a lot about the complexity of the operations at Newport News, you've got a lot going on there. Over the course of the year, can you talk about how you address those issues? And where do things stand right now, as you look forward?
Michael Petters: Well, man, I'm not sure I know where to start, I would just start, maybe I'll start with the pandemic itself really put us in a place in both of our shipyards to rethink the way that we do. Not just crisis management, but management overall. And we started thinking through how do leadership teams rally the team to support priorities, how do we allocate resources to the things that need to be done. And I mean a lot of us have messed around with Soccer. And when the kids are young, everybody, all the kids chase the ball, what the shipyards have really gotten very good at is making sure that folks play their position, stay in their lanes, focus on what's in front of them, meet their milestones, and drive through the gates that we've set up in front of them. And I have to say that the pandemic has brought that to a much clearer focus for us, because we had to do that with people. And so I'm actually, very excited about the way ahead, because of the fact that this team is now well tested over the last year of doing exactly the kinds of things that that we need to get done to support all this, this broad array of programs that we have.
Douglas Harned: So you see, the Virginia-class is pretty on track now after the challenges from last year. I mean just want to make sure how we should think about that?
Michael Petters: Yes, I mean I think we had to reset the risk register in Q2, but now that it's been reset, the milestones that we've set for ourselves, the pace that we have not just on the first ship or the second ship, but all the way through the class, I think we're meeting all those milestones and we're meeting them with some gusto and I'm pretty happy about that.
Douglas Harned: Okay, great, thank you.
Michael Petters: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
Michael Petters: Hi, Pete.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, Mike, on the creation of the CEO role, was there any particular existing programs or future programs that kind of drove the need to create that role. If so, I'd love to understand which ones, you talked about it kind of at the beginning in terms of integration, and I just thought about pie in the sky, if they go towards this kind of light aircraft carrier model for distributed firepower that maybe that would be a key integration project in terms of Newport News with a new and the big deck set at Mississippi. So just want to get your thoughts.
Michael Petters: Yes, it's an interesting question. I'm not sure I could say that it was one particular item, what we were seeing, and what we're hearing from our customers is this capability and this part of your business is something that we could use in this part of your business, whether it was the way we were applying material, or technology that we were looking at additive manufacturing, maybe some artificial intelligence, our information management systems, those kinds of things, it's sort of, it's more like the, there were several of those that when they add it together. It made more sense for us to start thinking about it in terms of an integration and not as a straight-up customer directly facing the particular customers. And I actually kind of been leaning towards this for the past couple of years as we've kind of evolved. So this was not a, I woke up one morning, and we just need to go do this, this has been something that we've been kicking around, because we've had great success with the governance that said push, push and delegate as much authority and accountability as far away from the center of the organization as you can. And that creates business units that are very focused on their particular customers. What we're seeing, though, is that our customers are starting to, they're starting to become a little bit more integrated, and the problems they're facing are becoming more complex. And so as a result, we need to bring a more integrated approach to solving that. And I look forward to having Chris in that role, because I think it's going to be, we were doing some of it, but we were probably missing some of it. And so I think that, I'm looking forward to seeing us capture more of that opportunity.
Pete Skibitski: Great. Thanks, guys.
Michael Petters: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Hi, good morning, everybody.
Michael Petters: Good morning, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Hey, Chris, could you just itemize and quantify everything on the cash flow statement that was non-recurring in nature or a pull-forward in 2020 and then also the reversal of them in ‘21? Just to get level set on that?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, so in my script, I called out the two main things, which was the progress payments, which I think was about 160. And then 130 for the CARES Act payroll tax, those are the two main things on the balance sheet.
Noah Poponak: And do those completely reverse in ’21 or is it partially ‘21 and partially ‘22?
Christopher Kastner: Well, we're estimating that progress payments reverse in ‘21. But obviously, only half reverses for the payroll tax.
Noah Poponak: Half ’21, half ’22?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, yes.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And then in the slides, you itemized continued strong working capital management. Can you give us a sense or quantify how much positive change in working capital, you're looking to extract over the next few years?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, I don't want to give a specific number for that, Noah. But I’ll point you to the deliveries that start to show up in ‘22. And that'll get us around the low-end of our range or potentially even better in some years from a working capital standpoint.
Noah Poponak: And are there deliveries in 2022 front-loaded, back loaded or fairly evenly spread through the year?
Christopher Kastner: Pretty balanced 21 and 28 should happen right at the beginning of ‘22 actually and then 73 is more Q2-ish and 96 is later in the year.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And Mike, just kind of bigger picture in longer-term, what is a realistic percentage of the United States Navy that is unmanned and Autonomous down the road? And how are you thinking through the different competitive landscape in that versus Manned?
Michael Petters: Yes, the first question I don't know how to answer that because we can answer that in terms of numbers of platforms. You could answer that in terms of capability and regions that you can handle from an unmanned. So there's sort of a mission kind of thing. So I'm not exactly sure how to answer that directly. The way we think about it is really about the capability set where the technology is, what are the kinds of things that we think are going to be useful and applicable to the mission of the Navy. And at this point, if you kind of look at the timeline, I think if you go back to, before we acquired The Columbia Group down in Panama City, our presence in the unmanned space, the Huntington Ingalls presence in the unmanned space was zero, we were cold, we were cold ironed in that space. We started with acquiring a little bit of capability, and a little bit of technology, we got to know the customers, we got to understand who they were and what they were trying to get done. And fast forward to where we’re today. We have strong offerings in every size and capacity and capability in the unmanned undersea space today, that includes the work that Hydroid does. That includes the work that we're doing in support of Boeing on the Orca program. And we've done that in say, five or six years, that shows that the business itself is accelerating. And that shows our commitment to it. So we're going to remain committed to it. We think that the unmanned undersea space is conceptually ahead, it's a challenging space. But from a ConOps perspective, I think it's conceptually ahead of the surface, the unmanned surface space, we do have a contract to work with the Navy in that area, as do several other companies. But we're going to continue to invest in the autonomy and build the capability. And frankly, I think this is going to be one of those where it's a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy. As we demonstrate more capability, and capacity in this space, it's going to become as we Huntington Ingalls and as we the industry demonstrate that it’s going to become a bigger and bigger part of the Navy's plan. What's the limit of that? I don't know, where does it go, I don't know. But that's the mission in front of us right now is to mature that.
Christopher Kastner: I'd like also to add that unlike our manned platforms, in unmanned, especially unmanned undersea, it opens up international markets for us. And there's significant international customers that are interested in those products. So that's also very interesting for us.
Noah Poponak: Great, okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Christopher Kastner: Thanks, Noah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Global.
Richard Safran: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thank you.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning.
Richard Safran: Mike, this may be a bit of a question for you, considering you were just, you’re just referencing it, on the chatter about the Navy looking for a smaller, unconventional carrier. I seem to remember reading about this same idea back in the early days of the Nimitz. What I wanted to know from you is, if you could comment, if you think this is a serious proposal by the Navy, or maybe an idea that's possibly been floated in reaction to some early issues that you had with the Ford class?
Michael Petters: Well, I think first of all, I think that let's give the Navy some credit, they're always looking for ways to accomplish their mission. In turn, they're always looking at trying to figure out ways to do that in a more affordable way. And so the question of once we decided 50 years ago, almost 60 years ago now to create a nuclear powered aircraft carrier, you always had to kind of compete that always with in a competition, with the conventional carrier in terms of affordability and on the one hand, the budget folks can look at it and say, well, it's cheaper to build a ship without reactors in it. But on the other hand you look at the set of capabilities that that brings to the carrier. And over the last several decades this analysis has been done. You're right. It was done back when Nimitz happened, it was done frankly, when Enterprise was done. And it's done all the time. But what it comes down to essentially, it kind of began and this is a conversation go on for a week. But what it usually comes down to is that, can you get 80% of the capability for 80% of the cost? And the answer is almost always no because it turns out that we, the cheapest thing that we do in the carrier business is build volume. And so if you want to take, if you want to take a carrier, that's 100,000 tons and you want to drop it to pick a number 60,000 or 70,000 tons and you want to take the reactors off of it, you just completely changed the capability set. And you're still going to spend a lot of money building that 60,000 ton ships. So, I think that it's a serious look, I think every look is serious, we stand ready to support the Navy, and whatever their mission is, and wherever they need to go. We're very proud of the Ford. And I would tell you that as a lead ship for the Ford cost, the Ford cost was too high. We made significant capital investments to drive that cost down inside the shipyard. And we’ve taken 15% of the man hours out of the Kennedy between Ford and Kennedy, and we streamline the supply chain, and so we're taking cost out of that ship. The next two ships were bought on a single contract, and the Navy advertised that not just including our savings, but all of their savings when they bought it Smarter, they save $4 billion. So as the Ford becomes more affordable, that makes that comparison even tougher. Having said that, if the Navy chooses to go down that path. And they think that's the way that they can meet their mission requirements most affordably we’re their partner, and we're going to support them all the way.
Richard Safran: Thanks for that. And just one other strategic question for you. The focus at Huntington is always very large, low production rate, high value added content ships. Unmanned systems, however generally have much lower valuated content, but I'm thinking higher production rates. So just kind of curious if you could comment about what that says about long-term margins at TS versus traditional shipbuilding?
Christopher Kastner: Well, let me start Mike. If you want to add, the long-term margins in TS will float upward. We're 3% to 5% return on sales. Now we'd like to think about it as EBITDA as a percent of sales because we have intangibles floating through the income statement there. But we do think there's opportunity in unmanned from a margin standpoint, especially with international content traditionally, you earn more on international products. So yes, we do think there's opportunity there. But remember, TS is a blended margin story. So we think that 3% to 5% return on sales right now is the right way to think about it, but it could grow from here.
Michael Petters: And I would just make two points. First that you touched on a key issue is that, we’re keeping the unmanned business separate from shipbuilding for exactly almost exactly the reason that you said, that unmanned customers are very different than the shipbuilding customers. And so we want to have customer facing organizations that respond appropriately and so that's been very successful for every business inside of TS, including unmanned. When we created TS, we've seen significant improvement in terms of being able to respond to customers and understand what their capabilities are, by getting that either acquiring that business or getting it out of shipbuilding. The second thing is that I would argue that the TS story is, it is about margin, but it's also about growth, I think the unmanned area for growth is going to be pretty significant. Pick your multiple, but over the next five years, I think that what we're spending in unmanned today as a nation is going to be small compared to what we're spending five years from now. And so that's at least as much relative on to unmanned, that's as much as an important part of the story as it is about the margin.
Richard Safran: Thanks very much for that. That was terrific.
Michael Petters: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Hey, good morning. I want to follow-up on what you just talked about. Just going to Slide 9, a couple of comments here. I don't know Mike, if this is you or Chris but on the unmanned side, if this is going to grow and the spending is going to rise, might we not see CapEx not dropped to 2.5% of sales? I mean, maybe magnitude doesn't compare to the core shipbuilding business, but wanted to ask about that as unmanned grows. And then also your comment about the shipbuilding margin in the low 8% range with steady improvements subsequently. I just wanted to marry that to, what you just talked about with the carrier deal, with these double contracted carriers, should we not see the kind of volatility? I think you were just suggesting this, that we've seen on 79?
Christopher Kastner: Let me try the first one, Mike. Yes, that was, we've already from a capital standpoint, on unmanned we've made a significant investment, we think with the Center of Excellence. So we don't see any additional capital investment at this time in the unmanned space. So if you want to talk about it.
Michael Petters: Yes, I’d just add, and that does depend on the rate of growth in the unmanned space. I mean, we stand ready to make investment if we need to, but there's nothing there that we see right now. Relative to the carrier business, absolutely. The two carrier ship contract was by far the most effective way and most affordable way to buy the ships.  And it does bring a chance for it to be much more predictable going forward. It is a pretty heavy contract to have on the beginning side of your business, which is you know well, how we’re very conservative at the beginning of our programs. And these ships, these two ships, the second one doesn't deliver until 2032. But I think it's going to play out very well for us and could definitely go a lot better, even better, it will certainly be better than what happened on Ford and will be even better, I believe than what we've seen so far on 79.
Robert Spingarn: Thank you, Mike. Thanks, Chris.
Michael Petters: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good morning, Chris now that you've got the 79 contract modification done. Can you just talk a little bit about what that means? Is it lower risk? Or does the risk just get pushed to the right or is it neither? And then does the low 8% margins at Newport assume improvement on carriers that’s just primarily Virginia-class?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, so it absolutely pushes the delivery, excuse me the test program to the right. And when you do that, you're moving your risk registers to the right. And it delays the margin expectations for CVN 79. I don't want to make any specific comments on programs contribution to the low 8%. But you'll see a general lift in Newport News, across all their programs, actually, as they have stabilized this year and into next year.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay. That’s helpful and then Mike, in response to Richard's question, you mentioned that the Navy gets $4 billion in savings from the Block V. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what your shareholders get from that? Why isn't what they get, the potential for higher margins in the future, if you all can execute effectively? And then can you talk about the degree to which that Block V ensures more serial production and less, maybe technology or requirements change ship to ship if at all? Thank you.
Michael Petters: Yes, so I'd say, first of all, the $4 billion is a Navy number. And while it's sometimes hard to remember, we're only a part of the total carrier cost. There's also, there's a significant government furnished equipment set that goes on, on the ships including the reactors, and the radars and all that sort of stuff. And so when the Navy added it all up, it was the savings associated with our contract, which we took from the efficiencies of learning curve in labor, and the efficiencies of economic order quantities in the supply chain. And we believe that those are pretty well understood. And that's what drove our piece of that contract. So and now, what are the shareholders get from that, they get a workforce that's not building the last carrier, they're moving from one to the next and so you're not having to go retrain them and get all of that sort of stuff. So it allows for, over time, better performance on the program and that's where we're headed. It's not better performance in ’19 or in 2020 or 2021 because that's the very beginning of the program. But we see these as they mature, they're going to become very important to us.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay, thank you.
Michael Petters: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Scott on for Gautam.
Michael Petters: Hi, Scott.
Unidentified Analyst: In a similar vein to Robert’s question, just looking at the CapEx, is the 2.5% number, the right way to look at the long-term CapEx number for the business, or is that more of just FY ’22 to ‘24 type number, and is the longer-term CapEx more of a 3% to 4%?
Christopher Kastner: I think we've made significant capital investment over the last few years. That's about $2 billion. We've invested in both shipyards that's about complete. So I think that that 2.5% last for quite a while actually. Now, as Mike indicated, if we see opportunities to invest for future programs, we could potentially do that. But for our current backlog, we're pretty comfortable where we're at for a pretty long time.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, that's the only question I had. Thank you.
Christopher Kastner: All right, thanks.
Operator: At this time, I'm not showing any further questions. And I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Petters for any closing remarks.
Michael Petters: Well, thank you all for joining us today. We really appreciate your interest in what we're doing and appreciate the work that you all do. We hope that everyone out there will continue to stay safe in this dynamic environment. And we look forward to that time when we can all get back together again. Hope everybody has a great day. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call. . I would now like to hand the call over to Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Blake, you may begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.  Also in the remarks today, Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that's posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation along the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release.  With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during these trying times. Let me start by providing a COVID-19 update on Slide 3 of the presentation. The rate of new cases has stabilized in our shipyards, and we are maintaining a sustainable and manageable level of attendance. This has been driven by our ability to start rapid testing of employees and move them out of quarantine and back to work in a prudent way. While this has proven to be successful, the dynamic nature of this virus will require us to continue refining our policies to adapt to changing circumstances.  And regarding COVID relief, we have highlighted 2 decision-makers that the defense industrial base is at the nexus of economic sustainment and national security, and it is uniquely positioned to drive economic recovery in every state through thousands of suppliers. We remain hopeful that directly related COVID-19 labor costs, like quarantining and other paid time off, will be reimbursed, and we will work with the administration to provide the necessary documentation to support this effort. We also continue to encourage the customer to provide funding for cross-program delay and disruption impacts.  Now let me share some highlights from the quarter, starting on Slide 4 of the presentation. Sales were $2.3 billion, and diluted EPS was $5.45 for the quarter. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $1.6 billion, resulting in backlog of approximately $45 billion at the end of the quarter, of which approximately $22 billion is funded.  Turning to capital deployment for a moment. Earlier this week, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend from $1.03 per share to $1.14 per share. And this action demonstrates our continued commitment to grow the dividend and return excess cash to our shareholders.  Now regarding activities in Washington, the federal government began the new fiscal year on October 1 under a continuing resolution, which funds government operations through December 11. During the intervening period, we continue to encourage Congress to complete their work on the fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Bill, adopting the strong support for shipbuilding and other national security priorities reflected in the respective bills of the House and the Senate. We also continue to support completion of the appropriations process as soon as possible to minimize the impact that a long-term continuing resolution could have on current and future programs.  Finally, regarding the defense department's future naval for study and the range of ship quantities it reflected, we are pleased to see our portfolio of ships in the plan and recognize that there is still much work to be done to bring any plan to fruition. We look forward to continuing our work with the Navy, the Coast Guard and the Congress to help them effectively and affordably support America's national security requirements, and we remain confident that we can create additional capacity that may be necessary to support even the most robust shipbuilding plan.  Now let me share a few business segment highlights from the quarter. At Ingalls, NSC-9 Stone successfully completed acceptance trials and remains on track to deliver late this year. On the DDG program, DDG 119 Delbert Black sailed away from the shipyard and was commissioned in late September, while the next ship, DDG 121, Frank E. Petersen, Jr., is focused on system completion and support of trials next year. DDG 125, Jack H. Lucas, the first Flight III destroyer, continues to move through important production milestones and is scheduled to launch in the first half of next year. Structural work on LHA 8 Bougainville is on track, and the ship is nearly 40% erected.  On the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale completed electronic systems light-off at the end of July, and is focused on preparation for additional major system light-off event as the shift comes to life. LPD 29 Richard M. McCool, Jr. is well into production, and the key laying ceremony for LPD 30 Harrisburg is planned for later this year.  At Newport News, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 76% complete, and the team is continuing to focus on compartment completion and key propulsion plant milestones. And we recently reached agreement with the customer on an undefinitized contract action to begin execution of the single-phase delivery work, and we expect to definitize the contract change next year. CVN 73 USS George Washington is continuing to progress through its final outfitting and test phase and is approximately 81% complete. The ship achieved 2 significant milestones during the quarter with commencement of shore steam testing and completion of the potable water system to support the start of moving the crew back aboard to ship later this year.  On the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana achieved a key milestone as the boat was Christened in front of a virtual audience in September and is preparing for launch expected by the end of the year. The submarine is approximately 89% complete and scheduled for delivery to the Navy in late 2021. And finally, SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the pressure hull complete and float-off milestones in 2021 as planned.  In our Technical Solutions business, financial and operational performance was strong across the board. The integration of Hydroid is now largely complete, and we continue to expand our presence in key markets. During the quarter, we were awarded more than $200 million in new business. We also have a number of large captures in progress that are expected to drive further growth while we continue to focus on delivering critical national security mission requirements across our broad customer base.  We also broke ground on a new Unmanned System Center of Excellence in Hampton, Virginia during the quarter. This new campus will complement our current facilities in Massachusetts, Florida and Washington, that have been delivering marine robotics to the Navy for nearly 20 years and gives us the space and infrastructure we need to scale our operations and meet the needs of our customers now and into the future. This includes the manufacturing and support of large and extra-large UUV requirements. I am excited about the alignment of our offerings in this market with the Navy's unmanned strategy, and we look forward to helping the Navy expand their unmanned fleet in an affordable and timely manner.  As I prepare to close, let me first thank each and every 1 of our over 42,000 employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication. Their efforts allowed us to continue meeting key programmatic milestones during these challenging times. I encourage each of our employees to take care of themselves, take care of their families and for them to be safe.  I am very pleased with the progress we have made this year and the focused skill and creativity demonstrated by our entire team since the pandemic started. We are achieving key milestones. Our programs continue to be well supported in Washington, and our Technical Solutions business is well positioned to support the Navy's evolving unmanned strategy.  And finally, I want to highlight the key attributes that create a very solid foundation and a bright future for our business. We have a $45 billion backlog, a strong management team, a well-trained workforce, a significantly recapitalized, more efficient shipyards and a very strong balance sheet. The combination of these attributes positions Huntington Ingalls Industries to generate strong free cash flow and continue creating long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.  And now I will turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Christopher Kastner: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our third quarter results and also provide some comments on our 2020 and long-term outlook. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 5 of the presentation, our third quarter revenues of $2.3 billion increased 4.3% compared to the same period last year, driven by growth at Newport News and Ingalls. Operating income increased by $8 million to $222 million when compared to the third quarter of 2019, and operating margin was flat at 9.6%. The increase in operating income was driven by a more favorable FAS/CAS adjustment, partially offset by lower segment operating income compared to the prior year.  Net earnings in the quarter were $222 million compared to $154 million in the third quarter of 2019. The increase in net earnings was driven by lower income taxes due to higher research and development tax credits for prior years, a more favorable, nonoperating retirement benefit compared to the prior year as well as higher operating income, partially offset by higher interest expense.  From a segment standpoint, Ingalls' revenues in the quarter were $675 million, an increase of 4.3% from the same period last year. Revenue growth was due to higher volume for both the DDG and NSC programs. Ingalls' operating income was $62 million, and operating margin was 9.2%, relatively consistent with results in the prior year.  Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased 6.6% from the same period last year. Revenue growth was due to higher volumes in submarine and aircraft carrier construction as well as growth in fleet support services. Newport News operating income was $79 million and operating margin was 5.8% in the quarter, which compares to $121 million and 9.5%, respectively, in the prior year. These decreases were driven by lower risk retirement on the Virginia-class submarine program. Additionally, results were impacted by lower risk retirement for fleet support services, as the prior year period benefited from contract actions related to work on LA-class submarines.  Technical Solutions revenue in the quarter was $320 million, a decline of $6 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenue at the San Diego shipyard due to the conclusion of several repair contracts, partially offset by the acquisition of Hydroid in early 2020. Technical Solutions operating income was $21 million, and operating margin was 6.6%, which compares to $9 million, 2.8%, respectively, in the prior year. The increases were primarily driven by improved performance in Defense and Federal Solutions following the successful integration of recent acquisitions and expected post-acquisition cost synergies.  Turning to Slide 6 of the presentation. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $744 million and total liquidity of $2.5 billion. As we've noted before, we plan to delever later this month by calling $600 million of our senior note due in 2025. In the third quarter, cash from operations was $222 million, and net capital expenditures were $62 million or 2.7% of revenues compared to cash from operations of $363 million and $113 million of net capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2019. In the quarter, we contributed $150 million to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans, of which $140 million consisted of discretionary contributions to our qualified plans.  During the third quarter, we paid dividends of $1.03 per share or $42 million. As Mike mentioned earlier, our Board of Directors recently approved an 11% increase to our quarterly dividend to $1.14 per share. While we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter, over the long term, we view share repurchases as an integral part of our capital allocation strategy. We plan to resume share repurchases once we see sustained normalization of activity related to the virus.  Turning to Slide 7. We've updated our 2020 and 2021 pension and postretirement benefits outlook. For 2021, projected FAS expense has increased by $50 million from our initial outlook to $111 million, primarily due to lower discount rates. Consequently, the 2021 FAS/CAS adjustment has decreased from the prior outlook and is now projected to be negative $64 million for the year. Please remember that pension-related numbers are subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria. We will provide a multiyear update of our pension estimates on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.  Moving on to Slide 8. We have narrowed some of our expectations for 2020 results and want to provide additional context on our long-term free cash flow target. For 2020, we expect shipbuilding revenue to be approximately $7.9 billion, and we expect Technical Solutions revenue to be approximately $1.25 billion. Inclusive of intersegment eliminations, we expect total revenue of approximately $9 billion. We expect 2020 shipbuilding operating margin to be between 5.5% and 6.5%, and we expect Technical Solutions operating margin and EBITDA margin to be approximately 2.6% and 6.2%, respectively.  Technical Solutions' outlook includes San Diego Shipyard and UniversalPegasus results through December 2020. For your reference, we have also provided a view of our full year expectations for technical solutions that excludes San Diego Shipyard and UniversalPegasus in our outlook table.  Regarding free cash flow, we continue to expect free cash flow in 2020 to exceed $500 million. And together, we expect that 2020 and 2021 will generate cumulative free cash flow of approximately $900 million. There are several significant factors that are impacting the timing of cash flows between the 2 years, including customer payment cost changes and acceleration of payments to subcontractors, the payroll tax holiday and the timing of capital projects. Given these moving pieces, we think it is appropriate to view these years collectively.  Regarding capital expenditures, specifically, a number of the capital projects initially planned for 2020 have experienced delayed starts or extended schedules due to COVID-19 and other factors. While the overall size of our roughly $2 billion generational capital investment program has not changed, some of those expenditures are being pushed into 2021. Given this, we now expect 2020 capital expenditures to be approximately 4.5% of sales and 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of sales, with capital expenditures declining to 2.5% of sales in 2022.  Finally, we'll provide detailed 2021 guidance and other information during our year-end call, but as we are coming through the review of our long-term outlook, we are confident in reiterating our expectation to generate approximately $3 billion in free cash flow cumulatively from 2020 to 2024.  And now I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: . Our first question comes from Jon Raviv of Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: So we're back to the multiyear cash flow. It's negative $3 billion cumulative in 2020, 2024. PAUSE What are you seeing now that you did not see last quarter kind of lets you reinstate those targets? Yes.
Michael Petters: Yes. So last quarter, we were in the middle of a pandemic and coming through resetting all of our program schedules and coming to our financial plan related to that. So it's just a function of being more comfortable with the plan as we move through the year and being more comfortable with our ability to manage through this pandemic.
Christopher Kastner: Yes. I would just add that our weekly kind of active case rate has really stabilized at this point. But back in the summer and when this first started, it was pretty high. In fact, our highest level of active cases was right around the time of the call. And so trying to predict where we were going to go from there, we just felt like it was prudent for us to take a pause on that. We feel pretty good now that the protocols we have are in place and give us a pretty good way to deal with what's going on. We're like everybody else. We're kind of watching to see what this -- the next few months are going to be like, but we think we're well positioned for that.
Jonathan Raviv: And then just a sort of follow-up in terms of margin. Looking at margin performance, obviously, the 4Q that hit your full year target, it has to be some improvement, and then also the past 6% to 8% -- the 2021 target. Just sort of kind of an update now that you reset the schedules, had another quarter under your belt, how much of getting back to 6% to 8% and then eventually more normally beyond that, how much is in your control versus relying on government reimbursements for the cost and some of the updates on the big programs that are driving it, such as the definitization of the carrier contract?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. Jonathan, it's all in our control. We're not relying on any reimbursement from the customer for the COVID reimbursements. We just simply have to execute. Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything there.
Michael Petters: Yes. I mean, we're being pretty conservative relative to cost recovery for COVID, but we're focused right now. Our primary focus is on how do we effectively and efficiently execute that backlog given the -- all the external things that are going on, we control the things that are happening inside our gates. And so we're after that.
Operator: Your next question is from Carter Copeland of Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: So just to clarify that point on the COVID cost reimbursement. So you have no assumption of recoveries or reimbursements from the customers? So if that were to actually come through, that would be all upside, I presume?
Christopher Kastner: Yes.
Carter Copeland: Okay. Okay. And just a follow-up on the -- on this. Center of Excellence, you guys mentioned in the quarter, is that principally going to be set up as an IRAD-focused facility or something different?
Christopher Kastner: Well, I mean, it's a capital investment for an advanced manufacturing facility to support programs that we already know we have. I mean, we're doing manufacturing to support the Navy's extra-large UUV program, and we do considerable manufacturing to support not just Navy, but international UUV programs that are smaller than that. And the Navy's announced other programs, and we would see that that's a way for us to prosecute those programs as well.  This kind of came out kind of what's the next step after the Hydroid acquisition to really help the Navy. It's really -- it positions us to be able to help the Navy's plan come to fruition. So we're really excited about it. We think it's a step-change in where the undersea unmanned business is going to go for the nation. And certainly, we're pretty proud of our position in that.
Operator: The next question is from Doug Harned of Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: Last quarter, when you took the charge for -- charge at Newport News related to Virginia class, and you talked about schedule changes, and is this related to the Montana, the New Jersey and the Massachusetts, you mentioned schedule on the New Jersey earlier. Can you talk about now, a quarter later, how do things stand in terms of getting to sort of new schedules on those 3 boats? And then how should we think about that trajectory in terms of when we could expect margin performance on this?
Michael Petters: Well, I'll talk about the schedule and the operations. We took a pretty big dividend attendance in April and May. Where we've been since then is we've been pretty steady in terms of what we can predict in terms of the number of people that are going to be there and who's going to be there and how to allocate those resources. And that's working very well for us, and it's really consistent with the schedules that we reset at the end of Q2. We're still seeing the -- I mean, we still have less -- we probably have less than 200 active cases, but that's a couple of hundred active cases in the business. And it does move around in our workforce, but, by and large, we're able to predict the schedule recovery. Now once you get the schedule piece of it, let me make clear, we're tracking the schedules, the new schedules. The opportunity to really recover the divot that we took out, we haven't quite figured out how to go and accelerate back to where we were in terms of schedule. But we're working on that, and -- but we're definitely supporting the new schedules that we have laid out.  Now it's about -- Doug, as you know, it's about, how efficient are you doing that? The things that we put in place from a training and development piece for our young workforce, the action teams and the engagement on critical operations, we're seeing first-time quality improvements. We're seeing some efficiencies. There's not enough there yet to become predictable, but we're seeing all the right trends.
Douglas Harned: And then just staying at Newport News because one of the things you've talked about is that you have a lot -- I mean, you have a lot going on there. You just got the award for the single-phase delivery on CVN 79. And when you look at that and how that will play out, you've got some more content, I think it pushes timing back a little bit, but how do you think of that program now in terms of what that can potentially add as content benefits versus what some of the risks might be in there going to that single-phase delivery?
Michael Petters: Actually, let me start. I actually think it derisks it a bit, Doug, because we're resetting the test program on that ship over the next couple of years. So it's a chance to reset your risk registers, reset the sequencing. So ultimately, at the end of the day, I think it reduces the risk on that ship.
Christopher Kastner: Yes. And let me add that it can be very easy to kind of look down the silo of a single program, but derisking the test program on 79 actually allows for a more efficient and effective test program on the RCOHs and the submarine repair business. Those are deployable assets. The Navy's operating tempo now is higher than it has been in many years, and getting those ships moved and out is going to be really good for the Navy and for us. So there is a cross-program collateral effect that I think will be very beneficial to what we're doing with 79.
Operator: Next question is from Myles Walton of UBS.
Myles Walton: Chris, on the implied fourth quarter margins, obviously, 5.5% to 6.5% implies a pretty big range for 4Q, just curious, can you give us some of the big swing factors to get from an implied 4Q -- it could be 7% or implied 4Q, that could be 11% shipbuilding margins? Are there deliveries that we should think about as big risk retirements in that fourth quarter?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, sure. Dilutive NSC 9, we're planning in Q4. We need to make progress on the 73 test program. We need to float off Montana. Those are the major milestones in the quarter. I think centering in on the middle of that range probably makes sense, but it is -- it can be lumpy in shipbuilding. So we want to keep it broad.
Myles Walton: Okay. And I'll keep it to one and one follow-up. On the follow-up, Mike, the attendance levels, maybe is that how you look at returning to normal post virus. And it seems like that's one of the limiting factors or gating factors to capital deployment. So maybe give us what normal is given none of us actually know what normal is sitting in is doing some calls.
Michael Petters: Yes. I mean, normal is, I think, in the eye of the beholder. In a pre-pandemic world, on any given day, we would have -- 5% to 10% of our workforce would be on vacation or would be out for some reason. It's a little bit higher than that now, but it's not anywhere near where it was in April and May. And the protocols that we've put in place have allowed us to be more predictable in terms of who's going to be in and who's going to be out. And the only unprediction in there or the only thing that's not predictable is if someone actually becomes an active case or gets quarantined.  One of the protocols that we established in August was that we were able to finally get enough testing to go and do testing in the pool of folks that were quarantining. And because we were able to do that and effectively test folks that were quarantining, we were able to cut the number of people that were being quarantined by 2/3 because of testing. That's a big deal for us. And once we got that established, and we feel confident that we have the testing to support us when we do that, now we're at a place where we know where the workforce is. We're able to predict what we're going to be able to get done.  In addition to that, we've been able to hire during this whole process. We've hired over 3,000 people since the pandemic started. And so even though we have employees, who have -- who are still dealing with school closures and things like that in their -- outside the business life, we're able to go and start building the workforce again. So that gives us some confidence now that we have a pretty predictable path from a workforce piece of this, and that's kind of what we based this plan around.
Myles Walton: So sorry. So does that mean you could be in a position to start repo by the end of the year? Or is it really into '21?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. We're watching it right now, miles. We don't have a specific date when we're going to restart it yet.
Operator: The next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes. Just to follow up to complete on fourth quarter. In TS, the implication is that margin goes back to around 3.5% from where it is this quarter. So is there something unique in this quarter that doesn't sustain itself?
Michael Petters: Yes, there were some one-time items in this quarter, George, that improved performance in TS, along with some cost synergies they got relative to the integration of the acquisitions, which is very positive. But that's correct. There were some one-time items that are immaterial in nature that we took in the quarter.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then my -- on cash flow, Chris, you maybe $400 million next year, which is probably a little bit less than most people were thinking. Can you go through some of the puts and takes? I mean, obviously, you've got the payroll tax deferral. You've got to pay some, but that was kind of known in the second quarter. So I was just wondering if you could go through some of the changes there.
Christopher Kastner: Sure, George. Yes, we like to look at 2020 and 2021 collectively. So you've got the first one, which is a payroll tax deferral. There's also capital that moved from 2020 to 2021 because of the virus, and then the customer payment clause changes that could potentially turn around next year when they go back to the normal progress payment clause. So it's really all of those items, which are causing a lot of unpredictability between the two years. So we like to think about it collectively, and then we'll start to ramp in 2022.
Operator: The next question is from Ron Epstein of Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein: Just a question about maybe a possible opportunity. I mean, there's been some news that the SSN deployments have been delayed due to maintenance backlogs in the government shipyards -- in the 4 government shipyards. Is that an opportunity for you guys to pick up some work from the Navy on helping them with their deployment delays?
Michael Petters: Sure. I mean, we're in that now. We actually have 3 repair jobs going on at Newport News. Plus, we have a tiger team supporting the Navy in their home ports as well. We've been out of that business for a while. The classic way that that's been done, as you kind of point out, is most of that work for many years was done in the Navy shipyards. So getting that -- getting back into that business and getting started back up in the protocols that go around operating a deployable asset and doing work and maintenance and support for a deployable asset are really a little bit different than construction, maybe a lot different than construction. And so we're getting our team up to speed on that.  And we're working very closely with the Navy, not just on the work that we have, but trying to lay out a sustainable, predictable plan for how the -- I mean, not just Newport News, but how does the private sector, in general, support the Navy's need to have more submarines at sea? And I think that's a big part of what we're talking about with the submarine repair business, but, frankly, Ron, I think that's also a big part of what's happening on the -- with the future force and the future of the Virginia-class and that on construction.  So at the end of the day, I think no matter how many submarines the nation puts to see, we're always going to wish we had more out there. So that's a good spot for us, and we're working very hard in that space.
Ronald Epstein: And then maybe as a follow-on to those comments. When you look at the industrial base, do you think the industrial base can support potential third Virginia class on top of everything that's going on right now? Because it seems like the reality of a third Virginia class is maybe getting closer. I know it's not like a short thing, but it does seem like the drumbeat for that is getting louder.
Michael Petters: Yes. I do believe that it can do that. I think that the shipyards will have to build, maybe invest in more capacity and more workforce. I think that we're going to have to create some parallel capacity, maybe think a little bit more about buying pieces that we were doing organically before, maybe structural units or fittings or foundations or something like that. So we expand the capacity kind of in a parallel way as opposed to trying to do it all vertically inside the shipyards.  And then I think where you have to -- you really have to be focused if you're going to get it there is you got to get the supply chain up to speed. Our supply chain in support of all of shipbuilding, but particularly our nuclear enterprise, it's very capable, but it's also kind of thin. And so you really need to have a persistent, consistent, sustainable set of messaging to the industry that you're going to sustain this rate for significant time to create or attract the investment in technology, capital and people that the supply chain is going to need to go do.  I think the shipyards are ahead of that. I know Newport News is ahead of that. Our friends at Electric Boat have been working this with. We've been working with them. They've been working with us. We're all working it with the Navy. And so I think that there is the capacity to go do that, but it ain't a light switch, and you don't turn it on overnight. My rule of thumb, though, is that if you're persistent on these signals from the government, the capacity in the industry can be built faster than the government can appropriate the funding to go do it. And so -- because by the time it takes so long to get to the appropriations process, there's a whole set of signals and long lead times and RFPs and things like that in front of that, that would let the industry know that you're really serious about doing it.  So that's the path that we're engaged in right now is trying to sort all that out. And I'm pretty optimistic about it, and I'll go back to it again. No matter how many we build, we're going to want more.
Operator: The next question is from Robert Spingarn of CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: I wanted to switch on unmanned. A high-level question for you, Mike, and then a related one for Chris. But what's your view of the long-term profitability or profit structure of the UUV USV business? Does the manufacture of the body and all of these vehicles become a commodity with the value and high-margin work coming through the payload? And how do you position for that going forward? And then, Chris, I have a follow-on for you on the same topic.
Michael Petters: Sure. Yes, I think it's a little early on this to kind of be specific about it. I know that intentions are to try to make all the different parts of this as open architecture as possible. And certainly, having an open architecture set of platforms like we do puts us in a really good spot relative to where the work is today. Going forward, there's been a lot of programs out there that started out with the intention of being open architecture, and then you end up in a proprietary situation, which is frustrating to everybody. So our sense of it is that it's going to be great to have the platform because that gives you a foundation to lead into the rest of the missions and the integrations and all of that. That's going to be very important.  And I think that without the platform, you're going to need a partner. With the platform, you have a chance to partner or go organic or however it needs to be done to support whatever mission's there. So I think the structure will -- remains -- overall generic structure remains to be seen, but we're pretty excited about what it can be.
Christopher Kastner: I would add just a little -- go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Well, go ahead and finish that part, Chris, and then I'll give you the follow-on.
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So, it's a more traditional defense-type market that can be used internationally as well, right? So higher IRAD, higher investment within Hydroid, but also some international opportunities. So that's something that we have not done traditionally. So we see some opportunity there as well.
Michael Petters: And Hydroid has that.
Christopher Kastner: Hydroid has it, yes.
Michael Petters: They've been doing that.
Robert Spingarn: Right. And then so the other question was if the Navy goes forward with a relatively large unmanned surface vehicle, perhaps 200, 250 feet, could you leverage some of the existing depreciated PP&E that you have for the NSC program? Or would this be a start-from-scratch kind of thing?
Michael Petters: Yes, I think it's too early for that. Ingalls is absolutely right in the middle of that with Hydroid's involvement as well. But yes, I think it's a bit too early for that.
Operator: The next question is from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi: Chris, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the margin assumptions that are involved in the out-year free cash flow outlook, and then whether kind of line of sight to getting back to 9% to 10% has improved relative to last quarter.
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So I still think the Q2 top level outlook remains for 2021. And then we're going to talk a lot more about return on sales on our year-end call. But we will improve from there, but, again, I'd like to push any comments related to improvement on return on sales to our year-end call.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay. Okay. And then, Mike, I think at the Investor Day, you guys focused on M&A at the TS segment. I'm wondering if that is still how you're viewing kind of a priority for capital deployment or some of the challenges with shipbuilding and COVID has changed all that.
Michael Petters: No, we're still on that. We think we've talked already more this morning about unmanned, and I think we've talked about unmanned in all the calls together before this. We're excited about that business, and we've continued to make some investments in that space. We're also very excited about our energy business with the Department of Energy. There are significant environmental and nuclear operating opportunities in that space, and we're very excited about that business.  We're well positioned. We've become -- in the last 3 or 4 years, we've become a leading prime to the Department of Energy and the work that we're doing at Savannah River and Los Alamos and the Nevada test site. And so we see great opportunity there as well.  The Federal systems piece that we're working through, we've gotten that. -- we've really restructured that. And frankly, some of what you see in the results this time come from some leadership changes around cost structure and adjustment to rate structure. And in some, it has made us more competitive. And we are -- and we're able to focus down a couple of really significant lines of business like ISR, for instance.  And so we're -- I think we're starting to find our stride there, which is going to inform our approach to making investments in that space. So no, we're not really backing away from where we were in -- the investors conference was in the universe before the one we're in, but we're not backing away from that at all.
Operator: The next question is from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: You talked about the long-term cash flow forecast. I guess, when we think about the implied step-up from 2021 to what's required for the remaining years, I guess, a, should we think about that as a step-function in '22? Or should we think about it as something that builds gradually? And what's the role, I guess, that the -- I guess, having a plan for the single-phase acceptance of the carrier plays in that cash flow trajectory?
Michael Petters: Yes. So I don't want to get into too many specifics about that out-year cash flow guidance. It's $3 billion over 5 years. It will start to ramp in 2022. The CVN 79 absolutely plays a part in it because it pushes the delivery out a couple of years, but we're pretty confident that through sales growth, earnings growth and capital reduction that, that $3 billion will be achieved.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Great. And then maybe, Mike, as a follow-on, we saw the new shipbuilding fan recently from the Navy, but it also looks like we're likely looking at a change of administration here in January. So to what extent would you view that the specifics of that plan is pretty provisional and up for revision if there is a change in January?
Michael Petters: Yes. I'd start out with a couple of just boilerplate facts. National security tends to be pretty bipartisan. And the Pentagon tends to operate in a world where they're looking external to the country, trying to figure out how to do security. This Pentagon has said that we need a bigger Navy to be more secure. And they're working through that process right now. If you have a change in the leadership and the administration, the new folks are going to be looking at the same outside world that the folks that are there now are. And they might -- and there might be changes on the edges of is it this many ships or that many ships or anything like that.  What I take away from what has been said so far is that the future Navy needs to be bigger. It needs to be faster, cheaper and probably a bit smaller. And so -- in terms of sizes of ships. So a faster, cheaper, smaller set of platforms with a lot more of them. We believe that's going to persist. Now whether it turns into the same numbers that you see in the tables today, when you look at new tables that might come out next year, I think that's less -- I think that will be interesting to talk about, but faster, cheaper, smaller, more concept, I think, will be true of whatever we look at in the future. And we are working very hard and have been working very hard to position ourselves for that.  And I'll go back to the thing I said a couple of times here. I believe that no matter how you shape all of this, the undersea world and -- in submarines and unmanned undersea are going to be critical components of whatever future national security requirements we have. They're going to be critical components for it. So...
Operator: The next question is from Gautam Khanna of Cowen.
Gautam Khanna: Yes. I had two questions. First, for Chris, if you could just talk about the size of the equitable adjustment that you're pursuing with the Navy, just so if it does come in, we can size it. 
Christopher Kastner: Yes, we're still -- that's kind of an ongoing process right now, Gautam. We don't have a specific size of that.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. Is there any way to ballpark it based on what you guys have reported over the last couple of quarters or not?
Christopher Kastner: I would rather not at this point.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And then stepping back, the FSA, you guys have discussed it, but one of the questions we get a lot is new entrants are coming into the unmanned vessel market. And the concern is they may have lower cost structures and the like. And I just a.m. curious, besides Hydroid and some of the technology acquisitions you've done in the past, I mean, is this an area where you're going to need to do more acquisitions to kind of get the technology and/or the cost base in line with what's likely to emerge in terms of what's required for that market? Or if you could talk a little bit about the M&A pipeline and if you expect to deploy more capital in that category over the next couple of years.
Michael Petters: Yes, sure. The -- I think the issue there -- first of all, let's talk about cost. The cost structure piece of it is something that we're very focused on. We're keeping that business away outside of the shipyards. Because anybody who we're going to be competing out there is going to be -- they're not going to have a dry dock to carry around with them in terms of their cost structure. So we recognize that we've got to be pretty lean and mean if we're going to be competitive there.  Now our focus over the last 5 years in that space is let's go build capability. 5, 6 years ago, Huntington Ingalls was not in that space at all. Now we're in the place where we have capacity and capability to build all of the different sized platforms that any of the government customers might need. That starts with our acquisition of the Columbia Group many years ago and their Proteus model introduced us to a whole new set of customers, different than the ones, the Navy customers as well as other customers that are different than the ones we've been dealing with in shipbuilding. That acquisition led to our teaming with and partnering with Boeing on the XL UUV program to manufacture that large UUV program. And then the -- and that led to the acquisition of Hydroid, which gives us capability in every size range that the Navy is looking at today.  So that's -- from that standpoint, we think we're pretty well positioned. Now it's a place where it's going to be about innovation and technology. And we -- whether it's autonomy or artificial intelligence or you name it, it's going to be -- we're going to be trying to figure out what's the best solution for the next set of problems that our customers have. And then how do we invest in the solutions for the problems after next for the customers have. That's kind of a rational marketplace, and we're pretty excited to be playing in a market space like that. So are there going to be more investments? I would bet that there's going to be more investments in that space.
Operator: The next question is from David Strauss of Barclays.
David Strauss: Back on the $3 billion cash flow forecast 2020 through 2024, I guess, what got better during that period, Chris, to offset what looks like a lower or worse performance out of the core kind of shipbuilding business during that period, given where you marked things down to last quarter? Is it tension that's going to be less or just CapEx is going to be less over the period? What is there to offset the kind of core shipbuilding performance?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. Really nothing significant other than we rolled the plan up and the teams looked at how they're going to perform on their programs, rolled it through all the things we need to do to generate a business plan. We're still comfortable. So obviously, you're going to have less cash on the VCS program. But all in all, across all our programs, taking capital into consideration and working capital changes, we're still comfortable we're going to get there.
David Strauss: Okay. And then what were the -- what was the level of EACs in the quarter maybe split out between Newport News and Ingalls?
Michael Petters: Yes. So are you asking for cumulative adjustments?
David Strauss: Yes, yes.
Michael Petters: Yes, it was net favorable $4 million. Ingalls was positive $16 million. TS was positive $5 million, and Newport News was negative $17 million. Those -- Newport News negative adjustments were broadly across all their programs related to overhead issues, both COVID costs and resetting their base. So none individually significant.
David Strauss: Okay. And nothing on Virginia class?
Michael Petters: Just overhead impact.
Operator: The next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Chris, you have the $300 million cumulative 2020 to 2024, and you have the $900 million '20 and '21. So the $300 million minus the $900 million actually kind of nice and orderly, it's $2.1 billion, which, divided by 3, is $700 million. And you have the statement of getting to the run rate of $700 million. And so the numbers kind of cut pretty -- I know you're expressing some reluctance to get into the detail here, but the numbers cut pretty clean where, basically, you either have to look like approximately $700 million each of '22, '23, '24 or you'd have to be ramping in that period of time, which would mean you would be doing better than the $700 million, which was your prior run rate. So should we be thinking of those 3 years as approximately even? Should we be thinking that you're now saying you do better than the $700 million, which was your prior run rate? Or should we be thinking about the approximate in the $3 billion, meaning that something a little less than $3 billion is more probable?
Christopher Kastner: No, we're still comfortable with the $3 billion. I'm not hedging on that at all. Cash, as you know, can be lumpy related to working capital and delivery movements across periods. So it's not a significant ramp either between 2022, '23 and '24. It's pretty level-loaded. So I'll leave that there. Definitely not hedging on the $3 billion, and I think you're thinking about it approximately correctly relative to level loading.
Noah Poponak: So how does 2021 get from what sounds like $400 million, maybe slightly less than $400 million to swing, maybe not quite to $700 million, but pretty close to it just a year later?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. There's working capital changes, capital reductions. It's all in the mix there, such that we will definitely improve in 2022 from a free cash standpoint.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And then in terms of '20 and '21 with the 5 -- greater than the $500 million and the $900 million, I know you're combining them now, but you have the greater than $500 million through the year for 2020, and it sounds like multiple things have moved out of 2020. Can you quantify what's moved out of '20 and into '21?
Christopher Kastner: Sure. I can help you a little bit with that, Noah. It's $120 million of the payroll tax moving. And as you know, it moves over into the next 2 years. And then we have between $60 million and $80 million of capital moving from '20 into '21 as well. So those are the two major items, and then we have the customer clause changes that extends to the end of the year and could revert back in 2021. So those are the 2 major items.
Noah Poponak: If you started the year with the greater than $500 million guidance, and you have capital moving out, and then you had the favorable tax, I'm surprised that -- or, I guess, why isn't the year much better?
Christopher Kastner: Well, you're always subject to year-end variations relative to receipts. And as you know, our Q4 is always -- is very large from a cash receipt standpoint. So there's a little conservatism in there, for sure.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And then finally, what is your guidance for 2021 shipbuilding segment margin? Because some of the questions and comments...
Christopher Kastner: I'm sorry. It was -- top level was 7% to 8% return on sales. We'll give a lot more color on that on the year end call.
Noah Poponak: But the prior comment was 7% to 8%.
Christopher Kastner: 7% to 8%, yes.
Operator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Petters for closing remarks.
Michael Petters: Well, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and engagement with us and in our company, and we hope that all of you stay healthy, happy and safe out there. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Dwayne Blake, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Wanda. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in their remarks today, Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I’ll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today’s call. I do hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe during these trying times. So I want to start by expressing my very deep appreciation and gratitude to the workforce of HII. Since the COVID-19 pandemic started back in March, our team has been on the front lines of this battle. They have balanced fighting this highly contagious virus, while at the same time using every bit of their energy, focus, skill and creativity to achieve key milestones on our programs and help us navigate through one of the most challenging times of my 30-plus year career. And I can say without a doubt that what I have witnessed from this team over the past five months absolutely epitomizes our motto of hard stuff done right now. Now turning to Slide 3 of the presentation. I want to help you understand the thought process behind our approach to dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in our shipbuilding business. We have hired about 25,000 people in the last five years in an environment where unemployment was historically low. And we have invested over $0.5 billion to train and certify those folks to execute the backlog that we’ve been able to capture over the last five years, which now totals $46 billion. So as the pandemic broke, our first priority was to protect this investment in the workforce so that they would be trained, ready and available to execute our record backlog as we emerge from this difficult time. And at the outset, we decided to give our workforce the flexibility they needed to deal with the disruption in their personal lives. Think back to what it was like across the country in the middle of March. Schools were closing; many companies were forced to layoff portions or in some cases all of their workforce; and in some parts of the country, people were being told to isolate. And this backdrop created a lot of uncertainty and disruption for our workforce. So we introduced several benefit changes, including liberal leave to make it easier for our employees to stay home if they were sick or if they had child or elder care challenges, so those absences would not count against them. At the same time, we also had to stay in step with the CDC guidelines in order to assure those that could come to work, that it was safe to do so. And this included adjustments to shift schedules, to facilitate social distancing, temperature screenings, enhanced cleaning of high touch point areas between shifts, and requiring face coverings by everyone entering our shipyards. So during the second quarter, attendance of our hourly production workforce at both shipyards was approximately 65% with several days during April and May around 50%. Following the end of our liberal leave policy in May, we did see those metrics improve. And during June and July, attendance of our hourly production workforce at both shipyards was approximately 77%. Now cases have been increasing in our shipyards as states have opened up, but we are now seeing a sustainable and manageable level of attendance, and we continue to refine our policies to adapt to the changing circumstances. Now as a point of reference; after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, we lost a significant portion of the experienced workforce at Ingalls. With COVID-19, we took a lot of bold and aggressive actions to make certain that this pandemic did not result in a similar outcome. And I am confident that we have made the right decisions to preserve our workforce for the path ahead. Now we have also been making significant investments over the past several years to digitize shipbuilding processes, to accelerate efficiency and training of our young workforce. This investment created the infrastructure in our shipbuilding support functions that allowed us to increase the number of people we had working remotely by a factor of 10 in a matter of days. COVID-19 has been an extremely disruptive factor on our business and we have been pursuing all potential avenues for recovery of our costs with our customers. Now there are indications that we may be able to recover directly related COVID-19 labor costs like quarantining and other paid time-off per the provisions in the CARES Act or any subsequent legislation. However, at this point, there remains no clear path for recovery of delay and disruption impact, though the customers’ intentions still appear to be favorable. Now turning to Slide 4 of the presentation. During the quarter, we recognized a charge of $167 million, driven primarily by updated cost and schedule assumptions across all of our programs. The majority of the impact $111 million is on the Block IV boats of the Virginia-class submarine program, driven by recent cost and schedule performance and updates to assumptions for future program performance and efficiencies, which include the impacts of COVID-19. And let me provide some additional color for context and clarity. Our plan called for cost and schedule improvements as we work down the learning curve on the Block IV boats in support of a two-boat per year cadence. As we conducted our regular second quarter program status reviews, it became clear that the VCS program was particularly impacted by staffing and efficiency challenges as we reprioritize work to align with our customers priorities at Newport News. This in turn disrupted the cadence of work and significantly impacted our ability to reasonably rely on the assumptions we were using in our risk registers for both the boat learning and cost improvement. As a result, we are resetting our risk registers to reflect the performance trends we experienced in the quarter, including the impact of COVID-19. Note that the slide includes key milestones for our next two Block IV delivery boats. I am very proud of the team for their tireless work and uncompromising commitment to safety and quality during the ongoing pandemic. Going through these challenging times together will give the team invaluable insights and experiences that will help them learn, grow and drive performance that meets our safety, quality, cost and schedule targets as we move forward. Now let me share some highlights from the quarter, starting on Slide 5 of the presentation. Sales were $2.0 billion and diluted EPS was a $1.30 for the quarter. These results included the aforementioned $167 million charge. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $3 billion, including a $1.5 billion contract for the construction of LPD-31, resulting in backlog of approximately $46 billion at the end of the quarter, of which approximately $21 billion is funded. Our backlog is a tremendous source of visibility and stability with over 85% of expected FY2020 to FY2024 shipbuilding revenue under contract, and it’s well supported by the annual congressional authorization and appropriations process to this point. And regarding activities in Washington, we supported COVID relief efforts by the Navy, the Department of Defense and Congress to help ensure liquidity of the supply base, provide contractual relief and promote workforce retention. We also continue to work with Congress in supporting consideration of the fiscal year 2021 President’s budget request, and we are very pleased with the strong support for shipbuilding and other national security priorities reflected by respective defense authorization bills in the House and the Senate. The House’s recent passage of appropriations measures is encouraging, and we have urged the Senate to complete the appropriations process as soon as possible. And finally, we will continue to work with Congress and the administration to support additional authorities and investments that will enable our nation’s economic recovery through the defense industrial base. Now, let me share a few business segment highlights from the quarter. At Ingalls DDG 119 Delbert D. Black was delivered to the Navy, production was started on DDG 128 Ted Stevens, the first ship of the FY 2018 multi-year contract. And DDG 62 Fitzgerald sailed away from the shipyard. On the LPD program, the contract for LPD 31, the second ship and the Flight II class was awarded. And in addition NSC 9 Stone is continuing to progress through the test program and is expected to deliver late this year. Notable events since the end of Q2 include the contract award for the DDG FY 2020 option ship, the eighth Flight III ship and the sail away of LHA 7 Tripoli from the shipyard. At Newport News, CVN-79 Kennedy is approximately 74% complete and the team remains focused on compartment completion and completion of our single-phase delivery proposal for submission to the Navy. CVN-73 USS George Washington is continuing to progress through its final outfitting and test phase and is approximately 78% complete, the next major milestone for the ship is the start of crew movable later this year. In our Technical Solutions business, the team had two re-compete wins – two key re-compete wins, including a contract award to provide analytical support services to the U.S. Special Operations Command and an award from the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General to continue providing support services to the office of the Chief information Officer. TS also recently announced a major IDIQ contract award worth up to $3 billion over a 10-year period from the Department of Energy to provide nationwide deactivation, decommissioning and removal service at excess DOE facilities across the nation. Overall these recent wins reaffirms HII’s longstanding strategic partnerships with several of our key customers. In addition, TS recently completed a strategic equity investment in Sea Machines Robotics, a Boston based autonomous technology company that specializes in advanced software for unmanned surface vessels. This investment represents our commitment to advanced innovation across the unmanned systems market and our drive to form complimentary partnerships in this important and growing domain. I would like to conclude my prepared remarks by highlighting a few key attributes of our business. And these attributes point to a very stable foundation, a bright future as we work our way through this undoubtedly challenging period. We have a management team that in my estimation is the best in the business, the thoughtfulness, rigor, and resolve that the team has exhibited by continuing to meet programmatic milestones while dealing with the disruption from COVID-19 across the business has only reinforced my view. Over the past five years, we have made significant investment in human capital and took the right steps as the COVID-19 pandemic broke, to preserve our workforce so they would be trained, ready and available to execute our record backlog as we emerge out of this difficult time. In addition, our balance sheet is very strong. As Chris will discuss, we have taken a number of prudent actions recently that will lower our cost of capital and provide more than ample liquidity. And we continue to see free cash flow generation accelerating over the next several years as we complete the generation of capital investments in our shipyards this year. And finally our backlog of $46 billion, were over five times last year’s revenues, represents an incredible amount of work for us to execute and as a key reason, we took very aggressive action to preserve the investments we made to train and qualify our workforce over the past five years. This workforce is now operating in a significantly recapitalized more efficient shipyards with better technological tools at their disposal and is crucial to our success as we work through and accelerate out of this period of uncertainty. I want to thank them for the work they’ve done, particularly during the ongoing pandemic. As I said earlier, this is by far the most challenging operational environment I have experienced in my career, but I know we have the right team in place to answer the call. And I am very confident that we will emerge stronger and even more capable over the long-term. So now I will turn the call over at Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Mike and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our second quarter results and also provide some comments on our updated 2020 outlook. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 6 of the presentation, our second quarter revenues of $2 billion decreased 7.4% compared to the same period last year. Operating income decreased by $118 million to $57 million when compared to the second quarter of 2019. And operating margin decreased 519 basis points to 2.8%. The decreases were primarily driven by unfavorable adjustments totaling $167 million resulting from updated cost and schedule assumptions across our programs that Mike discussed earlier. Net earnings in the quarter were $53 million compared to $128 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in net earnings for the quarter was mainly due to the result of lower operating income, partially offset by more favorable FAS non-service pension benefit. From a segment standpoint Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $622 million were unchanged from the same period last year. Ingalls’ operating income of $55 million and margin of 8.8% in the quarter were down from second quarter of 2019, mainly due to unfavorable adjustments, including delaying disruption from COVID-19 and lower risk retirement on the NSC program, partially offset by higher risk retirement on the DDG program related to the delivery of DDG 119 as well as the recognition of incentives related to capital investments for the DDG program. Newport News revenues of $1.1 billion in the quarter decreased 12.3% from the same period last year. Newport News operating loss of $69 million in the quarter was down from operating income of $71 million in the same period last year. Both the revenue and operating income declines were due to unfavorable cost and schedule performance, and updates to assumptions for future program performance, primarily related to Block IV boats of the Virginia-class submarine program. Technical Solutions revenue in the quarter was essentially flat compared to the second quarter of 2019, while operating margin improved by 344 basis points to 2.8%. Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation, we’ve made it a priority to strengthen our balance sheet through this period of uncertainty. As I said in last quarter, we issued $1 billion in new senior notes and also entered into an additional 364 day revolving credit facility with $500 million of capacity. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $631 million and total liquidity of $2.4 billion. As I noted in last quarter, we planned to delever in November by calling $600 million of our senior notes due in 2025. In the second quarter, cash from operations was $201 million and net capital expenditures were $75 million or 3.7% of revenues, compared to cash used in operations of $44 million and $91 million of net capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2019. We continue to expect to generate over $500 million of free cash flow for the year. During the second quarter, we paid dividends of $1.03 per share or $42 million. Additionally, we contributed $56 million to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans in the quarter of which $45 million consisted of discretionary contributions to our qualified plans. Moving onto Slide 8, we have provided an updated view of our upcoming key program milestones. These milestones support our updated financial outlook for 2020, which is summarized on Slide 9. For 2020, we now expect shipbuilding revenue to be between $7.6 billion and $7.9 billion, and shipbuilding operating margin to be between 5.5% and 6.5%. In addition to updates to our assumptions for cost and schedule performance, our shipbuilding assumptions have been updated to reflect a single-phase delivery approach for CVN-79. The revised approach will result in an updated program schedule and we’ll move risk retirement milestones to future periods, consistent with that updated schedule. For Technical Solutions, we expect 2020 revenue to be between $1.2 billion and $1.25 billion. Operating margin to be between 2% and 2.4% and EBITDA margin to be between 5.7% and 6%. These Technical Solutions assumptions include results from the San Diego Shipyard through August, 2020 and results from UniversalPegasus through December, 2020. For your reference, we’ve also provided a view of our full-year expectations for Technical Solutions that excludes San Diego Shipyard and UniversalPegasus in our outlook table. For both revenue and operating margin, we expect fourth quarter performance to be modestly stronger than third quarter performance, given the timing of milestones for the remainder of the year. Finally, I want to provide a very high-level view of how we currently see 2021. We’re fortunate to have $46 billion backlog that provides a very stable foundation for the business. For shipbuilding, we expect revenue to be between $7.8 billion and $8.1 billion and operating margin to be between 7% and 8%. And for Technical Solutions, we expect revenue of approximately $1 billion and EBITDA margin to be between 7% and 9%. We will come through our planning process over the back half of this year, and we’ll provide further detail for our 2021 outlook during our fourth quarter earnings call. Now I’ll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Wanda, I’ll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning, guys.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Carter Copeland: I’ll take my initial and follow-up and just ask twp quick ones together. One, can you provide us any insight on cost reimbursement that you may get, that may influence some of this in the future, depending on what happens with that, with the DOD? And then secondly, on the Block IV negative cumes, was there any of that, that was not directly related to the disruption you’ve seen in the yards? Was there something idiosyncratic there that is worth noting? Any color on that you can provide would be great. Thanks.
Mike Petters: Sure. So I think as we – as you’re reading in the papers all the time, I think there was authorization for some relief for COVID impact that legislatively that the Pentagon has authorization for, but it was never funded. And so there is a debate right now about, how do you get that funded? And that speaks to stuff that you could say was 100% related to the virus, the – whether it was new cleaning stations or quarantines or things like that. What’s behind that, though, is any sort of follow-on delay in disruption. Our customers have told us that they want to cover that. They want to find a way to cover that. It’s not really clear to us right now how that’s going to play itself out. There’s legislative work going on. There’s work with the customer going on. But our basic assumption for our report today is that while we think that there’s a possibility that could happen, and we’re pursuing all the angles, our basic assumption is we’re assuming that’s not in the numbers yet. And so that’s definitely an effect for us. Secondly, Carter, you know us pretty well. Whenever something doesn’t quite go right, our first inclination is to say, hey, that’s on us. We didn’t manage that right. We didn’t have the right qualified person or we didn’t have the right instruction. I mean, getting the quality and the qualified person and the sequence right and getting the instruction right, we start in with a very clear eye view, say, hey, look, that’s on us. We did not get that. That inefficiency was our issue. And we had some of that here in this quarter. But you don’t have to scratch very far behind those things. And we have those every quarter, but you don’t have to scratch very far behind those things that either there was a direct or indirect or direct impact of COVID or an indirect impact of COVID or we just don’t have the degrees of freedom that we need to be able to recover from that inefficiency because of COVID. And so the challenge is we can isolate costs in our business that are 100% COVID related, but when you move to the rest of it and say, we have inefficiencies in the program performance, to try to separate out how much of that is, this is because we didn’t have the right person at the right time, and this is because we had impact from virus, it becomes really hard to separate all of that. And that’s why we reported it the way we did.
Carter Copeland: Okay. That makes immense amount of sense. Thanks, Mike.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Doug Harned: Staying on the – on Virginia class, you attributed a $95 million to sort of non COVID. And I guess, as you were just saying, like, COVID could have played a role perhaps in some of that, I guess. We hadn’t really seen these kind of issues general dynamics. And I’m just trying to understand how the issues you see there fit into the overall Virginia class Block IV program or are these things that are, in the sense, Newport News specific rather than something that’s impacting the broader lot work?
Mike Petters: I’m going to suggest, Doug – that’s a hard question. I’m going to suggest that that’s probably a little bit more related to the uniqueness of Newport News shipbuilding. Newport News has got a wide assortment of different products and different conditions of those ships. And at the beginning of this process, working with the Navy to try to make sure we prioritize deployable ships and then unit deliveries, that starts to move around the priorities in the business a little bit. And so that’s – when you think about deployable assets, you’re thinking about the submarine repair work that we’re doing. You’re thinking about the RCOH that we’re doing. We’re supporting the Ford at sea right now with weapons elevator work. We’re supporting – we’re, frankly, supporting naval shipyard work around the country in some – with some key skills. What happens is that you start – when you’re at less than full attendance, you start moving people from one area to another and you start trying to make sure that you are focused on getting the right skills on to the right place. And so I think that’s unique to Newport News. I think that dealing with commission ships and deployable assets is a unique challenge for them in this environment. Having said that, I would say that the focus on near-term milestones across the business has been pretty good. It’s the tail and the opportunity to recover in the tail that is the challenge. So I don’t know, Chris, if you want to add anything to that.
Chris Kastner: No, I think that’s it.
Doug Harned: And just to follow up. Then as we think forward, in the past, we had been looking to Block IV as you move down the learning curve. And if that matures, there’s a good source of margin expansion. You were looking at more in this 9% to 10% range before for next year and pulled that back some. Are we – as we look longer term, I mean, you’re heading into what, I think, is the more challenging part of CVN-79, the back last fourth of it. I mean, how are you sort of thinking about the margin trajectory at Newport News next year and beyond compared to where you were before?
Chris Kastner: Well, I’ll start. But for the – thanks, Doug. For the total business, we thought it was important to get some 2021 information out to you all. We’re still coming through our plans for the future years. I’ll give a comprehensive analysis of 2021 and how we see shipbuilding margins evolving, but I only see it improving from the numbers that we gave you for 2021 as we move into future periods.
Mike Petters: And let me just add. I think that in general, the trajectory at Newport News today compared to what it was four months ago is going to be a little bit – it’s going to take a little bit longer to get there. And I think it’s two parts of it. One is, how is Block IV going to play itself out? Two is we haven’t negotiated the single phase delivery on 79 yet. And as Chris mentioned in his remarks, that’s going to push milestones that we were looking at for this year and the beginning of next year, it’s going to push those milestones out. So the trajectory is going to be a little bit flatter, but my overall view of what’s going to happen in Newport News is they’re going to hit home runs. It’s just going to take them a little bit longer to get there because of the kind of work mix they have right now.
Doug Harned: Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is open.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Mike, a quarter like this kind of stands out, where Huntington was more exposed to an abnormality, externality in the market. And I just wonder – versus peers. And I just wonder, as you talk to your customer, and you point out something like this or something like Katrina or pick the externalities that you see more exposed to than not, why doesn’t this enter the discussion about what profitability should look like for the seemingly idiosyncratic risk that you carry in such a long cycle business?
Mike Petters: I think that’s a really good question. And it’s certainly a topic of conversation that we have with the customer. I would suggest we probably have that conversation with them weekly, if not daily. The other side of that, Myles, and I’m just going to tell you how the conversation goes, is that the other side of it is it’s – there’s $45 billion of backlog. And there’s revenue for this business that we can see into the next decade. And so there is a lower risk around the stuff that’s under contract and the other stuff that they’re working. So this is all part of the contract negotiations. And I’m not sure that we actually had pandemic in our risk registers when we entered our last round of contract negotiations. It will certainly influence the way that we think about negotiations going forward, but it is a bit of the conversation.
Myles Walton: And Chris, if the grand settlements were to come out, how much of the identified costs that you had in the press release would be reversed? Is it the $61 million of discrete items? Is it larger than that? Do you have any visibility on what’s the sales number?
Chris Kastner: Yes. Well, no doubt, the $61 million is discretely identified as delay and disruption that we estimated against our programs. So it’s very difficult to estimate the impact on the balance of the negative adjustments. No doubt it is included in there, but it’s just very difficult to estimate it at this point.
Myles Walton: Okay. I’ll leave it at two. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Your line is open.
Jon Raviv: Thank you. So I guess now that we have 2021 numbers, we’ll be asking about 2022 now. Thank you for that color. But Mike, you mentioned in your opening remarks that you do expect free cash flow to continue to grow here. I mean, Chris, you reiterated $500 million at least this year. Can you talk about the multiyear target? And I think you previously communicated on the $3 billion through 2024 and how you get attention and how you made a pension in that context?
Chris Kastner: Yes. Okay, Jon. This is Chris. I think it’s – there’s a lot of moving parts in cash right now. We have line of sight on 2020 where we’re comfortable with a bit over $500 million. But with the CARES Act and shipbuilding schedules moving a bit, the single phase delivery, I think it’s a bit early to talk about 2021 and beyond from a free cash standpoint. We’ll give you a comprehensive look at that at year-end in February.
Jon Raviv: Okay. I mean can you talk about some of the moving pieces that we should be – a little more specifics on some of the moving pieces because that’s a target. I think you’ve previously talked about, so what are some of the big swinging items that could be shifting here? Just because it’s a cumulative target that captures several years and theoretically captures a lot of the maybe year-to-year volatility that UPIs typically see.
Chris Kastner: Sure. CARES Act, obviously, is timing, timing-related capital, and pension seem to be very consistent. Working capital will move between the years, but I don’t see much impact there. And then obviously, less profitability this year and next will impact us a bit. But that’s really the moving parts at this point. So to give you a good timing and a cumulative number, I’ll just wait until the end of the year.
Jon Raviv: Well, I’ll keep it at two. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: This could be either for Mike or for Chris, but what’s the framework you apply to your capital allocation decision-making? Thinking about the money you put into the yards, the $1.8 billion, and just the latest returns on the business, ex-COVID, they just aren’t necessarily what you want them to be or consistent compared to peers, particularly when I compare this to your cost of capital. So just curious on the high level framework you applied, the decision making, both in terms of internal investments and then also really M&A as well.
Mike Petters: Well, I’ll start, Rob, and then Chris can chime in and correct me. I’m going to take you back and remind you from the very beginning that the capital investment that we made was a generational capital investment. We described it that way from the very beginning. We actually started down the path and said, this is not going to create new sales and, it’s not going to necessarily improve any current program performance. It’s going to be a generational reset of how the business is going to be operating for the next 25 to maybe even 50 years. What happened is that as we made that investment, they created confidence in our customer that they could – as they saw requirements for more ships, they basically came back and said, we need to go buy more ships. And so the last three years, the order book has filled up. Where we are today is that we’re on the back end of the capital investment, and we have a backlog that is historically high. I wish I could say I was smart enough to say that investing in that capital was going to create that backlog. I was not that smart, but it sure worked out. Now we have recapitalized facilities, and we have – the investment we’ve made in workforce sets us up to go execute the backlog. The returns that we’re seeing here so far, I’d say that jury is still out. Quite frankly, the – we’ve had to reset the workforce over the last five years. We’re on the front end of several major – with the backlog, we’re on the front end of several major big programs. We have three carriers under contract for construction right now. It’s been 30 years since we’ve had that situation in Newport News. Ingalls continues to compete successfully in the destroyer program and the Navy continues to move forward with amphibious programs, and then the Coast Guard program seem – goes very well. And the investment that we’ve made in the shipyard of the future in Pascagoula has been very effective in driving efficiency into the programs. So I think that – I’d say that the jury’s still out on the returns, but I’m excited about where we’re going to go because I do think that kind of narrowly around COVID first, we had about 10 days from the time we stood up our crisis team until we had our first case. We absolutely did not have mature set of protocols when we started. And we started down the path trying stuff. And some stuff worked and some stuff didn’t work, and we backed out of things and we tried new stuff. But let me give you a sense of where we are today. Today, we are – we’ve had as many cases in our business in the last 2.5 weeks as we had in all of the time before that. And yet we’re operating in a very sustainable way with a mature set of protocols that’s allowing us now to be able to predict the business going forward. And beyond that, we have a workforce that’s been through this particular event as a common behavior that will be a unifying then or catalyst for them for the remainder of their careers. And I think that now they’re moving into, and we’ve even seen their ingenuity to take advantage of the capital investment, take advantage of the technology investment and accelerate the opportunity to do better on that. So it’s been a rough three months, but, man, we have learned a lot, and we’ve accelerated a lot of opportunity here to transform the business. And I’m very excited about that. I’m really interested and really, really excited to be leading a chance to go after those returns that you’re talking about on capital. And I hope Chris…
Chris Kastner: Yes. And I’ll add, Rob, we use all the appropriate measures to measure capital or capital deployment decisions, but I’d also point to some investments we’ve made over the first part of the year in the unmanned space in Hydroid and Sea Machines. These are very important to the future of the Navy and the future to HII. So we’re very – we’re pleased with those investments, and those are the type of investments we’re looking for in the future.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Well, you guys both make good points. And Mike, I understand that’s a fair point that it’s expanded the backlog. But – and again, beyond COVID, not factoring that in, but longer term, are the returns the same as they’ve been with that larger backlog? Is this still a 9% to 10% shipbuilding business?
Mike Petters: Yes. Why not? I mean I think it’s actually – could be, yes, 9% to 10%. The question is, when are you going to get there? And that’s going to be driven by some of the contracting things that we’re doing around 79 and the activity around CARES Act and that sort of thing, but it’s also going to be driven by, how do we come through the pandemic and accelerate out the other side of it? Whatever the other side of it is. But yes, it’s definitely a 9% to 10% business.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ron Epstein: Good morning guys.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Ron Epstein: So Mike, I think you can probably sense this from the tone of the questions. You reiterated this 9% to 10% business, but we had to stumble here on the Virginia class. You got the big backlog. How can the outside community feel comfortable that you’ll execute on that backlog after this stumble, right? I mean – I think you can – probably it’s probably pretty palpable, the questions that are being asked. I mean, how can investors feel comfortable that you’ll execute on that backlog?
Mike Petters: It’s a show-me story, Ron. I mean, our view of it is that we know we’ve got to go do. We’ve built the team to go do it. We’ve made the investments we need to make, go do it. It’s going to be just the rhythm of actually executing over and over again. I’ve been through this before. I haven’t had – I haven’t been through the pandemic before, but I think I mentioned in my remarks, coming on the back end of Katrina, where, when we started at Katrina, we did not have really the cohesive workforce that we have today across the business. And in fact, I used to say that at the beginning of 2008 in Katrina, we had the youngest workforce in the industry at Ingalls, and in three years, they delivered 10 ships. And three years later, they were still the youngest workforce at Ingalls, but they had been the – they were the most experienced workforce in the industry, and that has served them very well over the last decade. I think that’s where – I thought that’s where Newport News was anyway before the pandemic. And what I see in the pandemic is this young workforce is accelerating the transformation of the business. I can’t tell you anymore than you got to – we put milestones out there. We’re going to go achieve those milestones, and you’re going to track the performance. That’s probably the best thing I could say.
Ron Epstein: As we go through the next quarter or two or three as outsiders looking in, what sign post should we look for? When – what’s the next thing that folks can say, okay, yes, they’re really doing it. What should we be looking for?
Chris Kastner: Yes, Ron, that’s a good question. This is Chris. So specifically on the VCS program, the story is going to be told by 794 and 796. So the float off of 794 over the back half of the year here and then pressure hole complete at the beginning of next year. Those are the next major milestones on those boats. And we’re going to provide you information on every quarterly release until we get those done to give you progress against those.
Ron Epstein: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
George Shapiro: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
George Shapiro: I just wanted to pursue the margins that are implied here. So if you took out the charges from Newport News or added them back, the core margin is like 3.5%. And normally, that’s been running at better than about 6%. So is this 3.5% the normal margin we should expect going forward because it’s calibrated for the adjustments on Virginia class as well as the Kennedy?
Mike Petters: No, no. And so we don’t give ship margins by division, but we’re between 7% and 8% for the last Q3 and Q4 for the balance of the year in shipbuilding, consistent with how we guided for shipbuilding for the year.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then on the other hand, if you looked at – if I assume the balance of the $56 million unfavorable adjustments, and I guess is at Ingalls, the margin at Ingalls would have been extraordinarily high, like 16% or so, it seems, kind of out of the norm or maybe not all the charges go there. Or if you could explain why the implication is you get such a high margin.
Mike Petters: Let me give you the kind of a comprehensive look at the cume adjustments, okay, George? Unfavorable of $167 million, favorable of $56 million for a net of $111 million. Of that net negative $126 million is Newport News. Ingalls is positive $13 million, and TS is positive $2 million, okay?
George Shapiro: Okay.
Mike Petters: Dwayne can walk you through that after the call as well, George.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then maybe just one for – more general one. So the revenue guidance that you implied for ships for next year after lowering this year, is that just reflecting the scheduled delay over several years? Or so why wouldn’t – otherwise, why wouldn’t the revenues be somewhat better next year than what you’re guiding to?
Chris Kastner: It’s simply projecting the schedules for the ships out into next year. We wanted to provide an anchor out there for you all to do your modeling. We’ll provide an update to that at the year end.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Chris Kastner: Sure, George.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thanks very much. And good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: Just to follow up a little bit on the profitability heading into next year, I think the guidance implies kind of mid-to-high 7% in shipbuilding for the remainder of 2020. You talked about 7% to 8% for next year. When we think about the moving pieces, what kind of prevents any margin expansion next year? And what’s kind of pushing out milestone on the carrier that might allow you to deliver some of that margin expansion?
Mike Petters: Yes. So we wanted to provide you an anchor for next year. So she could do your modeling, as I just told George. We’re coming through that single-phase delivery on 79 and we will adjust our plans based upon that final negotiated settlement and the schedules that result from it. So right now, the best outlook we have is what I provided in my script and what I provided in the outlook. If that changes, I’ll definitely let you all know.
Seth Seifman: Great. Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, could you remind us the period of time remaining that you expect to be working on the Block IV boats that this $111 million negative adjustment applies to your expected profits over what’s the period of time on that to lock for?
Mike Petters: Delivery of 800. It’s at least three to four years out. We’ll follow up with that, okay, Seth?
Seth Seifman: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Mike Petters: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is open.
Gautam Khanna: Hey, thanks. Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Gautam Khanna: Two questions. I guess, the first, is a follow-up to one of the earlier ones, on the VCS Block IV, if I recall a couple of years ago in Q4, there was a negative cume catch-up. And I just want to make sure, like was – is there any way to disaggregate the current cume catch as to whether – I’m just – like what was the realism implied in the – as of Q1 accrual rate versus Q2? Was there a lot of productivity that was baked in, and it was always going to be a bit of a stretch to get there? And I’m just trying to figure out like how much of this is residual from what were the issues earlier a couple of years back in Q4, well, versus just COVID disruptions that really kind of you threw you off the rails?
Chris Kastner: Yes, that’s a hard answer, Gautam, hard question and a difficult one to answer. I will tell you that it’s very disciplined process we use every quarter to assess our EACs. And as Mike indicated in his script, when we came through the VCS EAC, it just became apparent that we needed to reset our risk registers and reset our expectations for that program. So it’s kind of a challenging answer relative to the way you asked the question. But this adjustment in this quarter is a product of an EAC process that’s very disciplined and that we need to follow on a quarterly basis and similar to what we use on all of our shipbuilding programs.
Mike Petters: And we do it every quarter. And the review at the end of first quarter did not indicate that there was an issue.
Gautam Khanna: Right. And I guess, Mike, I think last quarter, you had made a comment that you thought you might be able to catch stuff up later in the year. Is the only difference that workforce absenteeism, et cetera, that – I’m just trying to isolate for the variables that could have explained the difference one quarter to the next. Obviously, COVID is lasting longer. And – but I think it’s – yes.
Mike Petters: I think it’s – I don’t remember the specific comment. I would say that we know a lot more about it today than we did at the end of April, beginning of May when we had that call. I do think that we said we were going to be working near-term milestones, given the attendance. We’re going to be working near-term milestones at the expense of long-term ones. And we thought our suppliers were going to be doing the same thing. And so we’re kind of working our way through that now. But I’ll go back to – where we stand today, we have a pretty predictable, sustainable understanding of the effort that we have and the protocols we have in place. And so we can now start to predict how the business is going to go forward. I would not tell you that we’re going to make up all the milestones from Q2 by the end of the year. I don’t think that’s going to happen. And some of those things may take quite a bit longer to make up. So we’ll have to just see.
Gautam Khanna: Yes. I appreciate. It’s a very difficult question to answer precisely. Chris, just separately, the long term – you’ve given a five-year guide on free cash flow and puts the back into that time period, I think it was approaching $700 million. Any revision to that view based on what’s happened today?
Chris Kastner: Yes. As I said previously, we need to come through our planning process prior to updating that. But essential factors that made up that guidance haven’t changed the backlogs there. Profitability, it will take longer to get to 9%, as Mike indicated. Capital is the same. Pension is the same at this point, and we’ll provide updates if we need to. But yes, there’s no reason to change it at this point, and I’ll provide a comprehensive update at the end of the year.
Gautam Khanna: Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open.
Matt Akers: Hey, good morning guys. This is actually Matt Akers on for David.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Matt Akers: Can you comment on the free cash flow guidance? You maintained the guidance for the year, even though it sounds like CapEx is maybe a little bit higher in the shipbuilding outlook a little bit worse. Could you just talk about what maybe the positive offsets were there?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So CARES Act absolutely helps us with the deferral of the payroll tax. That’s a positive. The Navy customer has – have done an outstanding job of ensuring that we get paid through this entire process. So we’ve been paid on time, and we’ve been making our milestones, right? We deliver 119, delivered 62, been making most of our milestones. So pretty comfortable with where we are from a cash flow standpoint this year.
Matt Akers: Okay. Thanks. Okay. And then, I guess, just getting back to the Virginia class. What’s the mix of Block IV versus V that you’re working on now? And does this negative cume incorporate anything for Block V? Or is it all Block IV? And sort of how do you think about the risk for Block V?
Mike Petters: It’s all Block IV. We’re very comfortable with where we are in Block V right now. We just started that program, and we’re very conservative when we start off a block.
Matt Akers: Got it. Thanks guys.
Mike Petters: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.
Joseph DeNardi: Hey, good morning. I promised to ask a non margin question, but my first one will be on margins. Mike or Chris, do you have visibility into getting back to 9% to 10% for ships? And like best case, can you get there in 2022? Or is it beyond that? And does going to single phase on CVN accelerate getting back there or delay it?
Chris Kastner: Well, we have to come through the negotiation of CVN-79 to determine what that impact will ultimately be. And I hate to be a broken record, but there are a lot of moving parts right now. And while we’re confident we’re going to get there, we just need to finish our planning process before we can give you a better guide at this time.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay. And then, Mike, you all talked at the Investor Day around capital deployment and building out your services division with a focus, I think, on nuclear services assets. Is that still your mindset? Has COVID kind of delayed capital deployment via M&A at all? And how’s the pipeline of opportunities look? Thank you.
Mike Petters: Yes. So we’re – we completed the Hydroid acquisition after all of this started. And we just made an investment in Sea Machines for some autonomy in the unmanned space. We’re very comfortable with where we are in unmanned and where we need to go, and we have a view as to how to proceed there. And so the market is really the issue in terms of how things are getting valued today. But that’s kind of – it’s just the environment we’re in. On the DOE side, the energy side, it’s the same thing. I mentioned that we are – we continue to increase our presence as a prime to the Department of Energy. We continue to increase our presence across all of the DOE sites. And so we’re – we have line of sight there on things that our customers are looking for and capabilities that they need and we have thoughts as to how to go and provide that in the remaining piece, the government services piece. I think where we have to go there is because that’s where valuations are really kind of hard to pin down. I think we have to go there is, a, demonstrate that we can execute in that business; and then, b, understand the niches in that business where specific capabilities will make a big difference for our customers and proceed down that path. So that’s the way we’re thinking about it. We’re not changing that. We’re maybe refining it a little bit, given the current environment that we’re in, but we remain committed to it. One of the things that we have – we are kind of living the dream on right now is that we are in a place where we are very heavily centered on manufacturing. The nonmanufacturing part of our business, the services part of our business actually did pretty well and is doing okay during this pandemic. So the challenges that we’ve had in manufacturing haven’t really replicated to any extent on the services side, and that just validates our idea that we have to continue to try to diversify the business.
Joseph DeNardi: Thank you.
Operator: At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Mike Petters: Well, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I hope that you and your families continue to stay safe and healthy. And as always, we do appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again real soon. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q1 2020 Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mike Petters, Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Messy. I am Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also, in the remarks today, Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website.We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release.With that, I’ll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Well, good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today on the call. So before getting into my remarks on the quarter, let me first provide a COVID19 update. As this national emergency began, we established three very important objectives.Our first objective was to minimize the impact to our workforce and to provide a work environment that is as safe as possible. Now this resulted in some benefit changes and some actions designed to give each individual employee as much flexibility as possible to help them navigate through these uncharted waters and make arrangements that they needed to make.In doing this, we assured them that their job was safe. We also made adjustments to ship schedules to facilitate social distancing and we enhanced cleaning activities in our shipyards and since taking these actions, we are approximately 25% of our employees working remotely and are experiencing about a 70% to 75% attendance rate at both shipyards.Our second objective was to protect the national asset that is Huntington Ingalls industries. We've been identified as critical and mission essential by the Department of Homeland Security by the Department of Defense and by the U.S. Navy. So we took action during the quarter to enhance liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet and Chris will discuss those actions in more detail during his remarks.And importantly, our supply chain is a critical part of the industrial base and our ability to help our suppliers especially those small businesses will reap benefits as we come through this pandemic. To this end, we've accelerated more than $50 million of payments to our critical supply chain partners. This not only helps them but it also help their communities as our supply base resides in nearly every state in the union.Now our third objective was to be the reliable source of information for our employees and to that end, we've kept a very frequent and steady drumbeat of communications to our employees and to our community through multiple vehicles including social media. We've kept them informed,. We've answered many of their questions and provided them the resources and guidance they need to help keep them and their family safe.Now additionally, I've been personally engaged in multiple strategic efforts centered around this pandemic and I participate in weekly calls along with the other defense industry's CEOs, with the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for research development acquisition James Hondo Gertz. Now I would be remised if I did not add that the U.S. Navy has really leaned forward during this crisis, ensuring uninterrupted contractual payments and the continuation and even acceleration of contract awards such as LP 31 that was awarded in early April.These efforts are a great help to our industry and provide stability, liquidity and business continuity and I credit assistant sector Gertz for his immediate action to these kinds of issues. As a nation I believe we need to focus and adapt to what is being rightly called the new normal. We knew early on that this crisis was not going to be over in a few weeks or even months. So we have worked to change our business to effectively operate in that new environment.For example we have now over 11,000 people working remotely to tenfold increase from where we were just eight weeks ago actually we had already started transforming our business. So this crisis has provided us a catalyst to accelerate this transformation and we believe we will be able to weather this storm and continue to provide our critical products and services to our customers around the nation.Now let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Slide Four of the presentation. Sales of $2.3 billion for the quarter were 8.8% higher than 2019 and represent record highs for the company and diluted EPS was $4.23 for the quarter. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $900 million resulting in a backlog of approximately $45 billion at the end of the quarter of with approximately $21 billion is funded.Regarding activities in Washington, our actions in early February supported congresses' consideration of the budget in regular order, but our focus rapidly shifted mid-quarter to mitigating the impact of COVID19 on our workforce and supply chain and we will continue to work with Congress and the administration to support authorities and investment that will enable our nation's economic recovery through the entire defense industrial base, which is uniquely postured through tens of thousands of suppliers across all 50 states to be the engine for that recovery. We also look forward to congressional consideration of the fiscal year 2021 budget request in the coming months.Now let me share a few business segment highlights from the quarter. At Ingalls, the team delivered LHA 7, Tripoli in February and wants two ships in the quarter; DDG 123, Lenah H. Sutcliffe Higbee in January and LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale at the end of March. DDG 119 Delbert D Black completed acceptance trials during the quarter and then delivered on April 24. NSC 9, Stone is progressing through final assembly and test activities and is expected to deliver later this year. And finally DDG 62 USS Fitzgerald completed sea trials and plan production work during the quarter and is scheduled for sale away this summer.Newport News, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 72% complete and the team remains focused on compartment completion and preparation for primary system testing. Newport News is working closely with the Navy to pursue a single phase delivery approach on CVN 79. Now this change from a two phase delivery would extend the Newport News performance duration while supporting the Navy's plan for efficiently delivering a completed ship in 2024.Initial indications are that incorporating a single phase delivery will increase the scope of work under the contract and stress the construction schedule and the test program to the right. However, the ultimate financial and schedule implications will not be clear until we definitize the change with the Navy. CVN 73 USS George Washington is progressing through its final outfitting and test phase and is approximately 74% complete.On the submarine program SSN 794 Montana is expected to launch in the second half of the year and remains on track to deliver in the first half of 2021 and we anticipate SSN 796 New Jersey achieving the pressure hall complete milestone in late 2020.In our Technical Solutions segment, we received several contract awards across the Department of Defense for manned and unmanned airborne intelligence and ISR support and secured recompete business with the U.S. Postal Service for enterprise IT operations. In January, we announced our largest award of the quarter, a task order to support the U.S. Air Force Europe's ISR operations with a total potential value of $954 million over five years.In addition, we closed the Hydroid acquisition at the end of the quarter which significantly expanded our capabilities in the important and rapidly growing autonomous and unmanned maritime systems market. So in summary, I am encouraged by what we've been able to accomplish during these unprecedented times. Our leadership team is demonstrated flexibility and agility to respond to new developments, while continuing to achieve a number of key milestones and finally our $45 billion backlog, unprecedented program visibility, strong balance sheet and thoughtful leadership through the COVID19 crisis allowed us to remain confident in the long-term financial targets and value creation strategy we provided at our Investor Day in February.Now I'll turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials, Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks Mike and good morning. Today I will briefly review our first quarter results and also provide some comments on our 2020 and long-term outlook in light of the current COVID19 pandemic. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website.Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide Five of the presentation, our first quarter revenues of $2.3 billion increased 8.8% compared to the same period last year, driven by growth across all three divisions. Growth at technical Solutions was driven primarily by mission-driven innovative solutions where results included a full quarter for Fulcrum which was acquired in late February 2019.Revenue Newport News was due to higher submarine construction volume and growth at Ingalls was driven by higher volume on the LPD and DDG programs. Operating income increased by $54 million or 33.5% to $215 million when compared to the first quarter 2019 and operating margin increased to 176 basis points to 9.5%. These increases were primarily driven by a more favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment and higher risk retirement at both Newport News and Ingalls.Net earnings in the quarter were $172 million compared to $118 million in first quarter 2019. The increase in net earnings for the quarter was mainly the result of higher operating income and a more favorable FAS nonservice pension benefit, partially offset by a $16 million loss recorded in other income as a result of lower returns on marketable securities related to our nonqualified benefit plans.We are pleased with the operating results for shipbuilding in the quarter including the 5.7% sales growth compared to the first quarter of 2019 and a 8.3% return on sales. In Technical Solutions, our core nuclear and MDI businesses are performing as expected. In the quarter, Technical Solutions achieved a very strong book to bill ratio of 1.6, which included a significant new window to support the U.S. Air Force, Europe's ISR operations.As Mike mentioned, closing the acquisition of Hydroid in the first quarter positions us as a leader in the strategically important autonomous and unmanned maritime systems market. We continue to make progress on the other portfolio shaping activities that were highlighted at our Investor Day in February, including the contribution of our San Diego shipyard to a new ship repair partnership, which we expect to complete this summer and the divestiture of our oil and gas business.Turning to Slide 6 of the presentation, cash from operations was $68 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $66 million or 2.9% of revenues compared to cash from operations of $11 million and $74 million of net capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we contributed $30 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the quarter of which $20 million consisted of discretionary contribution to our qualified plans.We also repurchased approximately 391,000 shares at a cost of $84 million and paid dividends of $1.03 per share or $42 million bringing our quarter end cash balance to $28 million. As the COVID19 situation evolved and a high level of uncertainty that came with it, we thought it was prudent to hold share repurchases, which we did on March 11. Through the end of Q1, we've returned to shareholders 107% of free cash flow generated from 2016 through the end of the quarter. Share buybacks will continue to be an integral part of our capital deployment strategy once volatility related to COVID19 subsides.Moving on to Slide Seven we have recently taken a series of actions to enhance our liquidity and further solidify our balance sheet. After the quarter closed, we should $1 billion in new senior notes and also entered into a 364 day revolving credit facility with $500 million of capacity. We are fortunate that our primary customer, the Navy, has taken steps to accelerate cash flow under our contracts, which have test down to our supply chain partners, primarily for small disadvantaged businesses. Given these changes to our debt profile we now expect our 2020 interest expense to be approximately $104 million.To summarize the hard work and dedication of our employees during this difficult time has been truly tremendous. We've incurred and will continue to incur additional cost related to our COVID19 response in order to keep our employees safe. Additionally, as Mike noted, we've experienced staffing levels at about 70% to 75% over the past several weeks. These lower staffing levels will likely impact program scheduled and efficiency and increase ship estimates to complete, the materiality of which we will not know until we get greater clarity regarding the return to normal staffing levels and have a full reconciliation of supply material delivery schedules.We are confident the cost incurred for COVID19 response are allowable cost under our contracts. Further, we continue to evaluate these impacts, the programs against our contractual terms and current and pending legislation for the potential to obtain equitable adjustments to target cost target price and program schedules. We're working closely with our customers concerning the treatment of cost and we will be able to provide additional details on COVID19 cost treatment and recovery as we move through the year.However, as of today we expect a modest impact to sales in Q2 due to reduced attendance in the shipyards. We also see shipbuilding sales growth for the year to be at the lower end of the previously provided range of 3% to 5%. We will gain more clarity as we move through the year and plan to provide a more comprehensive update during our second quarter earnings call.Finally we continue to believe that our strong balance sheet and liquidity and high degree of visibility and stability provided by our backlog make us well positioned to minimize the impact of COVID19 on our business. We also do not see changes to our long-term financial expectations, we communicated in February at our Investor Day including our expectation to generate approximately $3 billion of free cash flow from 2022 through 2024.Now I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: [Operator instructions] Thanks Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. I'll turn it over to you, Messy, to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jon Raviv: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just a question on the performance in the margin, which I know heading into the year is going to be a lower margin year for a variety of reasons and also backloaded. You reiterated the number for the year at 9%. We did mention there's could be similarities from COVID. Just give us a sense for what kind of relation we should see now with Coronavirus. Then I've a follow-up.
Operator: Ready for the next question?
Jon Raviv: Hi this is Jon Raviv. Can anyone hear me?
Operator: We have a technical difficulty, if you will remain online. The conference will resume. And your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.
Mike Petters: We're back. Sorry about that. We got dropped there for a little bit. So I'm -- three or four questions and you guys have already answered them. So we'll catch up as we go along.
Carter Copeland: It was just John's question but we've got your back. I fumbled with the mute button many times. So no worries I wondered if you could give us a sense on the most up-to-date data you have on the headcount levels in the yard. I can imagine that something you're monitoring day-to-day just like we're monitoring any of these other COVID related curves them and the impact that that has on your estimates for what the disruption will be and productivity.Have you seen any change since the end of the quarter in the month of April, have you bottomed out, has it improved, any kind of up-to-date color that's beyond the month of March that you can provide?
Mike Petters: Thanks for the question. It's been pretty steady. The initial disruption for our folks to figure out what sort of disruption they had in their lives, well they had family members that lost their jobs or they had kids at home, they had to work their way through that. They've worked their way through that and I think as we said the aggregate, the attendances is about 75%.You can parse that a lot of ways but basically where folks who have to be present in the business inside of the shipyards, that number is lower than 75%, but the rest of our workforce either they're working remotely or while we've changed the conditions that they're working in on-site have been able to support at a higher level than that. So we've been pretty steady for the last I would say the last two or three weeks anyway. So the number you have is the number we've got.
Carter Copeland: Okay. If you try to parse it between the two yards, what's the difference?
Mike Petters: It's pretty much the same in both places. So the number one driver in attendance right now by far is the schools are closed and folks have to decide how they're going to take care of their kids and all the usual mechanisms for people to take care of their kids are not available either. So that's our biggest driver in attendance. I continue to argue that we've got to find a way to get schools back to where parents are going to be comfortable to send their kids to school. That's got to be at the top of everybody's list. If that happens, we see this moving ahead.We're removing -- we're shifting our posture as well. Now that we've kind of stabilized this, we're starting to look now to how do we expand our employment and fill it back in. So we're moving ahead and leaning forward on this.
Chris Kastner: We'll come to the estimates on our shifts in the quarter and incorporate that reduced attendance on the schedules and the impact on the touch labor on our shipbuilding programs, but we're assessing the opportunities. Our expenses have changed right. So the most obvious one is travel essentially zero, but less obvious is stuff like Teladoc, which is something we put in place a while ago, and in spite which means our people are not in the emergency rooms and that's much less expensive for us.So when we come through the quarter and the year it's going to be -- we're going to assess the risk on our ships related to reduced attendance, but also the impact on our expenses. So it's more of a holistic approach than just what's the attendance in the yards and what happened to productivity on the ship.
Mike Petters: In fact I am encouraged the key milestones for our production were essentially meeting the key milestones that we have to meet and just of the top delivery as a destroyer in the last couple weeks is evidence of that.
Chris Kastner: 119 62 is on schedule and it's on schedule, very comfortable with how our performance on shipbuilding.
Mike Petters: It's going well.
Carter Copeland: All right. Great. Thanks for the color guys.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS
UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hey everybody. Good morning. This is actually Emily on for Myles. On the recent result of the competition given the contract value for the ship, which you have been able to sign up for that aggressive of the price and then additionally what is on your radar now for potential awards at Ingles and is the recent award for LPD 31 how did that impact Ingle's production line?
Mike Petters: Well a lot of questions there. Recognize that everybody in the competition was pricing at different ship and so almost impossible to do an apples-to-apples comparison of price to what happens. So I think the Navy try to run a best value competition and selected a winner. We're obviously very disappointed with the way that it came out, but we'll get a debrief from the Navy on what happened and how could have gone better and we'll go forward from there.Relative to other opportunities at Ingalls, we still have a very strong presence and production line right now in the large deck amphibs that Phase 2 LPD program evidenced by the contract just signed for LPD 31. We're building destroyers and we're still building national security cutters and so the Ingalls future is bright as far as I can tell. This is a disappointment but the thing about competition is you get up off the field and you go learn your lessons and get better the next day and so that's kind of the way we're taking it.The Navy is starting to rethink -- starting to think about what the future hold and we're going to be part of that future and so we're excited about that.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jon Raviv: I'll not to break everything this time I suppose. You guys hear me though? So my question has been I don’t know if you have heard it was just on margin progression through 2020 and 2021. I know this year has going to be somewhat backloaded in terms of that 9% that you reiterated that number. What is the progression and how do you achieve that with various unknowns around COVID19. And then related to that you what is the potential menu of outcomes from the new one phase carrier plan.
Mike Petters: No real change to margin progression at this point Jon. We have to come through Q2. No doubt it's going to be a complicated quarter, but I wouldn’t change the way we're thinking about margin in 2020 or in 2021 actually.
Chris Kastner: I think it's too early. There is as Chris said earlier, there's certainly some risk now that's in our risk register that we didn't have in our risk register two months ago, but on the other hand there's opportunities out there that our business is actually transforming itself organically kind of just doing it and so there's some real opportunities for us in terms of efficiencies and new ways of doing business and moving ahead.So it's way too early for us to try to back away from anything that we might said earlier. As far as single phase delivery for 79 what the original plan was, was the Navy and the company had decided to split the delivery to finish the platform and then use the post-delivery time to upgrade the actually install the sensors and those state-of-the-art things that change three, four, five generations while you're building to ship and you want to make sure it's as current as possible.The Navy has come back and said it's going to be better to do this in an integrated fashion because that way we can get a more complete ship sooner and be able to get the ship ready to deploy faster that way as well. Now what will do is that will change the schedule for -- if we're able to work through this and we haven't, but if we work our way through this it will change the schedule for how the test program proceeds throughout the ship because we'll line that up with the new schedule.It will change the way the Navy mans the ship which is part and parcel to our test program and delivery schedule. So at this point, there will be more scope. It will probably move the schedule around a little bit and until we get through it, I'm not sure we can say exactly how much impact it's going to have, but we think it's actually the right answer for getting that ship to the fleet and into operation as fast as possible.
Jon Raviv: Just a follow-up on that point Mike, I appreciate the perspective there. Is it not the case that the late 2020 improvement in margin and I get that 9% on what rely on some of those things happening on the carriers that you just outlined, if those things don't happen then that one of the risk items to the 9% this year perhaps.
Mike Petters: Yeah, I would say that's true but that's why I've said we actually think again we got to kind of work our way through the weather we're going to do contractually go account for this and then we look at what are the opportunities we're seeing in the rest of the business from the impact of this virus. So that's -- we just don't know enough right now to back away from them.
Operator: Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein.
Doug Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wondered Newport News I wanted to talk about Virginia Class and Columbia Class because in addition you're going to see some significant block five work on Virginia Class. I know you highlighted in the release that Columbia Class the amount of work there is starting to grow and can you -- could you talk first about what you see the impact for those two programs they're growing on your margins in Newport News?
Mike Petters: Well Doug, it's going to be the beginning of these programs and by now you know that when we're at the beginning of the program, we're reasonably conservative in terms of that. Now truth is that we know a lot about submarines and the arrangement on Columbia is just a little bit different than the teaming arrangement we have on Virginia Class and so how that works and how the expansion works and goes forward I think we've got that factored into. It's part of the way we were thinking about the year and the next several years when we talked to you guys in February. So there's not really much change in all that. It blends right into to get us to where we want to be.
Doug Harned: When you look at Columbia Class as we look at this, we were assuming it really start to get production growth taking off kind in the 2023 timeframe. For Newport News how do you see that trajectory of work? How much of a contribution do you expect Columbia Class to be making over the next couple years?
Chris Kastner: Doug, this is Chris. We don't have a specific number for you, but it does start to ramp from here and then really start to get some momentum in 2021 but we don't have a specific number for you.
Operator: Your next question is from David Strauss with Barclays.
Matt Akers: So now that I know it's closed, I was wondering if you could give us sort of an update on your thought and opportunity there for unmanned ships and for how that…
Mike Petters: We're obviously very excited that we were able to close this deal. It took us -- it was a long process with Kongsberg working through what would make the most sense for both of us. But now that's in the portfolio we've come basically in the last five years we've come from not really being present in the space to being as capable as anyone in the space and we're excited about that.The Navy will continue as it thinks through what they want the fleet of the future to look like. They're going to continue to look at how do you more missions with less people and so we think that's a critical element of what they're going to be doing and Hydroid certainly gives us a step into that.There is a range of programs that the Navy's already announced that we're actually part of. Boeing has the lead on the XL UUV program and we are working with Boeing to manufacture that product for them. The Navy's announced a large diameter UUV program and we're very excited about the opportunity for that and then Hydroid as a business before we ever got involved with them, they were a dominant player in program smaller than that.So this gives us now a full range of capability in the portfolio platforms and missions and capabilities that we believe the Navy is going to need in the UUV space. It also then gives us an opportunity to expand into the unmanned surface space because a lot of the -- a lot of the capability that you're going to need relative to autonomy or manufacturing and advanced manufacturing and those kind of things are going to be the things that you're going to need to be able to be successful in the unmanned surface space.My assessment is that the unmanned surface basis is lagging the undersea space but I don't know that that last and I am excited about where this whole program is going to go. It's going to be a great business for HII to be in because it's going to be a critical mission for our customer and that's really want to be.
Matt Akers: And then I guess can you comment on sale of UPI business and just given kind of the volatility in oil markets right now, that contract and so if there was any changes to your thought process there?
Chris Kastner: No doubt it's a volatile market out there right now. The good news is that UPI they've got some really stable long-term customers that are hanging with them and we have a strong management team. So that process will continue. We expect it to complete this year.
Operator: Your next question is from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Chris, I got a couple for you first, Newport News and then Ingalls, but following up on John's question on CVN 79 and the single phase delivery from a cash perspective that delivery in 24, are you able to comment at all of what the impact of that would be on 23 cash flow and kind of the slope of free cash flow you pointed to back at the Investor Day.I think you reiterated the cumulative target of $3 billion but just wondering if this could make it more back weighted. So that's…
Chris Kastner: I don’t think so. We don’t know yet exactly because we haven’t definitized that change, but I don’t think it materially changes the slope. A little more detail on cash. I think with all we know right now on free cash and everything moving around we're still north of $500 million this year and then we start to ramp.
Robert Spingarn: Okay and just switching to Ingalls I was wondering if you could provide any color on the EBIT profile, the NSC program as it exists today, just so that we can get a better idea of how that program eventually ending might impact the business?
Mike Petters: I don’t want to do an program review with you right now. We don't really give detail on estimates of margin rates by ship. I want say from Ingles' perspective in the quarter, the LPD program is performing very well. Pleased to 28 and 29, the award for 31, so Ingalls had a really good quarter.
Robert Spingarn: I was just going to ask Mike if there's any customer interest in the 12 Tennessee Hall?
Mike Petters: Sure. There has been a lot of talk about it. I think the question at this point is where does the budget go and I think that that's kind of the big question mark out there for everybody, but the coastguard continues to operate the NSC at a high tempo with lots of mission success and lots of very positive and favorable feedback to us and it has been a program that has been funded and supported both from the Coastguard and from the Congress over the year. So I would say sure.
Operator: Your question is from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.
Pete Skibitski: Mike, I have a top level question about the Navy and Marine Corps outlook for ships. Kind of in light of the commandants guidance and budget pressures connected and I think there is a new shipbuilding plan in the works in the building also that isn't complete yet and I don’t know what's connected but I think it's connected to this idea of a light amphibious warships. So, kind of the net question is do you think the requirement for amphibious lift is going to be reduced or modified over the next couple of years in any way and is it kind of maybe shift to smaller amphibious ships, can you can compete effectively there, just in your thoughts overall about what looks to be a lot of change that might have impacted them in the near-term or maybe in the mid to long-term?
Mike Petters: It's a good a good question and it's certainly something that we're thinking a lot about. Look at the very top level, there is always a challenge of if you want to if you want to change direction, if you want to go in a different direction, the question is how quickly can you do that and recognize that your if you're going to trade-off current capability for potential future direction, that's got lots of unimplied risk there that hasn’t really been able to kind of break that mold of -- you can't really go in a new direction by trading off current capability and I would offer that one of the things that we continue to stresses is that current capability actually includes the infrastructure and industrial base that you have created.We hired more than 25,000 people at HII over the last five years. We spent $0.5 billion training them and we spent $3 billion to $4 billion a year in our supply chain where they've been doing the same thing as we have a industrial base that's ready to support the direction that you want to go. If you want going to go in a different direction and be successful with that, I think you got to think your way through how do I get the industrial base to move in that direction.And so, clearly the Marines are thinking about the concept of operations that's a little bit different than what they've been talking about. I don’t think in the end I don't think it changes their near-term requirement for heavy left and this discussion is not something that's going to say here's how we're going to get there in the next two years. I mean you're really talking when you start talking new shipbuilding plans, you're really talking about what the shipbuilding -- what does the Navy look like 10 to 15 years from now because the Navy that we're to have five years from now, you're building it today and that at that see today.So the timeframes have to be kind of thought their way through. I think that there's an opportunity here for the industry and the Navy to work together to take advantage of all of the assets that we have to create a capability that would support going forward. Now the other piece of what you said is something that we're thinking really hard about is that there is a bit of a floor for us in terms of as you get smaller in ship size, the market becomes a lot more competitive and so we got to think our way through that as just as a business how do we improve our competitive position as if this is a direction that our customers is going to want to go and we're looking hard at that.
Operator: And your next questions is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen.
Gautam Khanna: I have a couple of question and forgive me if these were obvious, but first just to be clear on the COVID impact on profit accrual, are you assuming percentage of completion accounting right, so you accrue less revenue as there are fewer people making progress on ship, but the margin rate you're assuming as though there is no COVID impact is that right assuming there will be some relief down the road?
Mike Petters: It's a good question. In Q1 there is really no COVID impact. there is no way to estimate that impact in Q1. We're going to assess that in Q2 as we understand the comprehensive impact and the opportunities related to it. So it's a good question, Gautam.
Gautam Khanna: So meaning in Q2 right now, you're a month and a couple days have passed in Q2, there is a COVID impact. Fewer people showing up at the yard, so you're accruing less revenue but you're accruing cost at the same margin that you otherwise would, again I just want to be very clear.
Mike Petters: That's right and you don't change your estimate until you come to comprehensive VACs on your ships, which we will do in the quarter in Q2 and then assess that in the quarter and deal with that in Q2.
Gautam Khanna: Okay So but let's just say that the Navy hasn’t given you guidance on what form that equitable adjustment will be would you then take a negative catch up in Q2 and then just wait and hope that you do come to a resolution and think of positive.
Mike Petters: You're getting into claim accounting there. I don't think you should -- from a claim accounting standpoint, you would not assume that they're going to give you a equitable adjustment to these costs. So without opportunities you would potentially have to do a negative adjustment, that's correct.
Gautam Khanna: Shifting to Technical Solution, there was a reference in the release to lower performance on a host of items. Oil and gas I think certain repair work etcetera. Could you just elaborate on what's happening in those and I think on environmental as well. So was this just again COVID inability to execute or was it something else and what are the plans on the oil and gas side?
Mike Petters: So actually in the quarter the major impact was the San Diego shipyard and some performance issues there. Oil and gas and nuclear were okay, but compared to last quarter the performance was a bit less. Nuclear is just timing and very comfortable with where they are and still comfortable with the 7% to 9% EBIT. I commented previously on oil and gas, we still think that will get divested this year.
Gautam Khanna: And then last one, catch ups by segment if you can give us the net.
Mike Petters: I've positive of 61, negative of 29, net 32. And two thirds of that net is Ingalls.
Gautam Khanna: And was TS a negative.
Mike Petters: That was pretty flat, little negative.
Operator: Your next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: Could you speak to in the '21 budget, there's not a second Virginia Class and there's been a lot of back-and-forth that there could be second Virginia Class and I think your friends are building a reactor first second Virginia Class. So how do we think about. If there Virginia Class or not and what's your latest read on that?
Mike Petters: You’ve been doing this as long as I have. You know that the budget comes over and then there is a process that congress goes through to get the budged squared away and pass and appropriated. There were some late moving items in the budget frankly from last year to this year, that I guess my assessment is that the Congress was surprised about and so when that happens, it takes a lot more work from the administration and from all the stakeholders to work their way through it.My sense of this though is that the outlook for that second Virginia is pretty bright. I think the Congress is pretty much made its intentions pretty clear and so I don't know how the pieces move around but I'd say I'm pretty optimistic about it.
Ron Epstein: And then when you think about the current pandemic, what opportunities has that opened up for you in terms of when you think about the Technical Solutions group? Are there potential M&A opportunities out there now that might not have been or potentially more attractive now and one of the things you guys articulated at the Investor Day is that scenario where you want to have some growth. Is this an opportunity to try to grow that business?
Mike Petters: I think that the issue right now is that valuations are just -- are I'd almost say mythical. To try to get to a fair value of up of a business is it's a hard read. We are still interested and we haven't changed our posture, but let's just take a if Acme is out there and suddenly Acme got wiped out by -- their share price got wiped out by this volatility, the Board of Acme still would think that they're worth a lot more than the share prices and so trying to engage in that is really pretty challenging but we're going to keep looking and we're leaning forward to try to find ways to make something out of it.
Ron Epstein: And then finally you might address this before but just to dig maybe a little dipper, how is your supply chain doing right. When you think about where there could be more assertive stress points and in particular some of your smaller suppliers if you're dealing with sole-source mom-and-pop kind of shops I mean how are they handling this and what are you doing to try to them through the situation, particular or they might have more exposure to industrial or aerospace markets?
Mike Petters: Thanks for the question. We're in direct contact with our entire range of suppliers several thousand across the country. I'd say at First Cut, we have reached out to everyone and said let's talk about what impact you're seeing and what impact that might have to our programs. The vast majority of our suppliers are saying at this point. no impact. Now I would say because where we are right now, I would say we put the word yet on the backend of that. They say no impact, we say no impact yet.There's a group of suppliers that are saying that they're seeing impact but no impact to our programs and I would say okay no impact to our programs yet and then there is a handful of suppliers that are saying hey, we've got real impact here and it is going to impact our programs. I think what I'm encouraged about Ron is that in the near-term, we're actually supporting the key milestones that we need to support whether it's ship construction activity or supporting a fleet, we have information and material we need from our supply chain to do that.What's harder to evaluate is what's going to be the impact around the corner, not in the near-term. I think in the near term we're working our way through that, but I think in the medium-term the stuff that needs to be going on today to support us at the end of this year or in the next year, how is that going and that's why we say put yet next to that because that I don't know that we have -- I don’t know that anybody has a very clear view of that.The last thing I would say is that one of the advantages that we have besides having the $45 billion backlog to go work through and support our supply chain is our supply chain is domestic. We're not dealing with suppliers in Mexico or suppliers in India or anything like that. Where there have been some disruptions that I've seen across the industry has been as much about trying to reach across the borders as it has been about trying to reach and find the small folks.So we're keenly engaged in this. We're working this every single day but at this point, I'd say near-term not in effect, medium to long-term, wait and see.
Operator: Your next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Hey Chris, just back to the question on all your margin rates and how the EAC recognition and accounting will work as you go through the year and there's potentially disruption, but you're telling us you're able to hold to what you thought before this disruption. My understanding from what some of the other defense companies that have reported already and spoke to this said was that amongst the handful of things that your customer was doing to help the industry get through this, that one of them was to the extent you were underperforming cost in what you had contractually signed up for if you were able to display that it was attributable to the Coronavirus pandemic that you would actually be made whole back to your original assumption. Is that am I correct that, that is going on and that's part of your ability to hold the margins or did I really misread that from somebody else?
Mike Petters: I think you may have misread it a bit. Now that being said it's an evolving situation a bit. But I think there's a lot of news and a lot of discussion out between government contractors and the government on the appropriateness of getting equitable adjustments through different legislation. The way we read it right now based on current legislation, you do not have the ability to recover equitable adjustments for delay disruption on your contracts.So we're not operating under that option. It doesn't mean it might not -- we might not get there and there are some thoughts across where we think you will get adjustments in recovery for stuff like quarantining more or if government facility is shut down, you can't go into work. You're not going to be harmed for that, but equitable adjustments and delaying disruption, we don't think that is fully understood yet or fully dealt with under legislation yet. So I would not make that assumption, no.
Chris Kastner: I would add, there is intent but there's not coverage and so where we are from accounting standpoint, at the risk of a practicing accounting with that on license. Where we are with an accounting standpoint we're just not assuming that. We are engaged in the discussion about how we make this happen and how do we -- what changes need to be made from an appropriation and from an authorization standpoint, but that has not happened yet and so that's where our engagement is we'll see how it does.
Noah Poponak: So assuming that doesn't happen then should -- what I then need to model that your shipbuilding margin in the second and third quarter declined sequentially from the first and then is more backend loaded to the fourth quarter or how do you -- how do you hold the margin with the amount of disruptions that you're seeing?
Chris Kastner: So I wouldn't change anything at this point. No, I think it's just too. I think it's just too early. There is going to be a modest impact on our sales for sure in Q2 but there's risk that we're going to have to deal with relative to reduce the tenants in the yard, but there's also opportunities because our expenses are fundamentally changing right now. They need to deal with all that when you do.
Noah Poponak: And whatever happens with the equitable adjustment is not going to happen in the second quarter.
Chris Kastner: That's just not going to be resolved in Q2.
Noah Poponak: Is your comments of not changing anything more geared towards you don't think the numbers are going to change or more geared towards nobody has enough information at this point to really forecast what the number you're going to give?
Chris Kastner: Well I think more of the latter but also we're making critical milestones within our shipbuilding programs. We're delivering ships performing very well within Newport News and Ingalls. So it's kind of a combination of both.
Noah Poponak: Okay And then last thing on this as it pertains to revenue, it's I guess similarly a little bit hard to square if you're at 70% to 75% staffing and its presented to completion accounting business why that wouldn’t have a larger impact on revenue I guess to your last answer there it sounds like you have less of the cost there or less of a staffing there if you hit the milestones, that's a bigger piece than just what the staffing level is, but I don’t know I am surprised to see 70% to 75% staffing minimal change to revenue and a percentage accounting basis, how do our growth that.
Chris Kastner: Well we're going to recover right. The attendance is going to recover. So we talk about 3% to 5% for the year. So we're going to recover from the sales standpoint. As we get our tenants back for the year, there is going to be an impact in Q2 no doubt, no doubt, but we still think we're at the lower end of the -- but as of today, we still we still think we're lower in the 3% to 5%. If the virus goes on for a prolonged period of time, that could change, but today it's the lower end of the 3% to 5%.
Noah Poponak: Do you have visibility right now from sort of state and local economic reopening stay-at-home order revision as to when you'll start to be able to restart or bring people back on I should say.
Chris Kastner: Well we're at the first level, we're the largest employer in both Virginia and in Mississippi. So we're deeply engaged and connected to the Governor's office in terms of how do you go about reopening the state and what makes the most sense and how you do that and we come that conversation from with the standpoint of we benefit the whole time. So these are the issues that you're going to -- as you start to open these businesses these are the things you need to be thinking about.You need to be thinking about employee safety, you need to be thinking about customer safety. I would just say the whole thing about reopening is it's voluntary. Businesses have to volunteer to open even if the Governor says to open, doesn't mean that you're going to open. The business has to volunteer to open. A business owner is going to say I can open because I'm confident that I can keep my employees safe and I can keep my customer safe and I can do that at a rate that makes sense for me to open.And the second voluntary per action there is on the customer's part and they have to decide that it's safe for them to go out. I think I mentioned earlier it's the -- when are you feel safe to put your kids back in school I think is the number one question relative to all of this opening. So we're deeply engaged in all of that conversation.How that plays for us is though is affects the employees that are staying home because they've to take care of their kids, it does affect them. So that's where the reopening affects them but our view is that we as I said, we're shifting our posture here to open we'll go higher, there is a lot of folks out there that are looking for work and there's a lot of qualified people that are looking for work and so we're looking to start expanding our attendance again to go and get back to the business of doing what we're doing.So that's all going to play out in the second quarter and it's going to be as Chris said, it's just way too early to tell how that's all going to play out, but that's our view and that's somewhat independent of how the governors are going to open the states.
Noah Poponak: Really helpful and I appreciate it. Thanks guys.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jon Raviv: Thanks so much for the follow-up and I might just follow-up on that budget question. Can you just also talk about the carrier side of things? I know it's kind of comes up every few years and such but sectary office seems to be looking to reduce that footprint. So just can you give a little sense of your perspective given the current fiscal and political backdrop?
Mike Petters: Jon thanks. I think the carrier conversation always comes up because it does -- it turns into a conversation about can we get more capability by changing structure or changing operations and things like that. There are lots of folks who have lots of opinions on this. I have been through this many, many times. The bottom line is you can't get 80% of the carrier for 80% of the cost. Volume is the cheapest thing that happens on the carrier making it -- actually making it larger is the way you capture the return on the investment that you’ve made.And so the idea that you're going to go and do something smaller maybe have a small fleet which is a different kind up for the Navy which is something to think about, but in general if you're looking for a replacement platform, that hardly ever works out well in terms of the analysis. I do think the Navy and the Pentagon and Secretary Esper are thinking about and rightfully so they're thinking about what are the future capabilities that we need and how is the best way for us to get there and how do we found that without sacrificing too much of our current capability and you're going to see lots of options.Some of them like that like the Marine Corps discussion that we had before. It's a very dynamic time in shipbuilding and we're going to be in the middle of that conversation as the principal partner for the Navy to help them achieve whatever it is that they want to do, but we come into that conversation with a $45 billion backlog of work that's going to be the foundation from which that conversation will take place.The investments that we've made in terms of creating the agile workforce that we need and the agile supply chain that we made, I think are going to support whatever direction the Navy and the Pentagon want to go and we're happy to be part of that.
Mike Petters: Okay. It looks like we have no more questions. I just want to thank you all for your interest today and we want to make sure that hope you all are safe and well and your families are safe and well. Please take care -- please take care of each other but we do appreciate your time for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you again. Thank you very much,
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-13 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q4 2019 Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on today’s call. 2019 was a great year for HII and I want to personally thank each of our 42,000 employees for continuing to execute their daily activities with an unwavering commitment to our core principles of safety, quality, cost and schedule.I would characterize 2019 is a year of positioning for the future. We captured major contract awards that resulted in a record backlog of $46 billion at the end of the year. We enhanced our shipbuilding facilities by bringing new projects online to improve efficiency and affordability, as we completed the fourth year of our five-year generational CapEx program. And we challenged our employees to remain focused on execution, while driving continuous improvement, innovation and creativity.Now specifically during 2019, we delivered three ships, the guided missile destroyer, USS Paul Ignatius, the National Security Cutter, Midgett and the attack submarine, USS Delaware, and we redelivered the USS Gerald R. Ford following her post shakedown availability. We were awarded an historic $15 billion contract to build two more Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers as well as an $8 billion contract for the Virginia-class Block V submarines. And we successfully navigated through the second year of our shipbuilding program maturity transition and achieve shipbuilding return on sales that were in line with our expectations.We expanded our portfolio by acquiring Fulcrum in early 2019, and additional portfolio shaping activities are continuing with the pending acquisition of Hydroid that was announced last week as well as the recent decision to divest our oil and gas business. Additionally, yesterday we announced an agreement to contribute our San Diego shipyard assets to a recently formed fleet sustainment venture backed by The Carlyle Group and Stellex Capital Management. All of our 2019 activities, as well as the recent portfolio shaping activities were approached with three key outcomes in mind driving growth, managing risk and generating strong returns.So now let me share some additional highlights from the quarter and full year starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.4 billion for the quarter and $8.9 billion for the full year were approximately 9% higher than 2018 and represent record highs for the company. Diluted EPS was $3.61 for the quarter and $13.26 for the full year. Adjusted EPS, which excludes the impact of a non-cash impairment charge related to the pending sale of our oil and gas business was $4.36 for the quarter and $14.01 for the full year. Chris will provide more details on this charge in his comments.New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $10 billion, including the aforementioned VCS Block V contract resulting in backlog of approximately $46 billion at the end of the year of which $18 billion is funded. And regarding activities in Washington, we are very pleased that the House and Senate passed and the President enacted the National Defense Authorization Act as well as all 12 appropriations measures for fiscal year 2020. These measures strongly supported ship construction and repair as well as other national security imperatives, including acceleration of both LPD-31 and LHA 9 and approval of incremental funding. The legislation also restored the refueling complex overhaul of CVN 75, USS Harry S. Truman and supported investment in submarines surface combatants, unmanned platforms, Department of Energy, nuclear and environmental programs and cyber defense.Now with the release earlier this week of the President’s fiscal year 2021 budget request, tradeoffs were made across various accounts, including shipbuilding to fit within the administration’s budget top line. Even so, we are pleased to see investment for priorities, including destroyers, amphibious ships, Columbia class, ballistic missile submarines and restoration of the CVN 75 refueling complex overhaul as well as increased integration of critical capabilities such as unmanned underwater vehicles and C5ISR. We look forward once again to working with the administration and Congress in supportive outcomes that best leverage our hot production lines, our supply chains and our service expertise to deliver the ships and capabilities that our nation requires.Now let me share a few business segment highlights from the quarter. At Ingalls, the LHA 7, Tripoli is essentially complete and the team is working towards delivery in the next few weeks. LPD 28, Fort Lauderdale is approximately 70% complete and it’s on track for launch in the first half of this year. DDG 119, Delbert D. Black completed builder’s trials in December and it’s preparing for delivery in the first half of this year. NSC 9, Stone is progressing through final assembly and test activities and is on track for delivery later this year. And finally, DDG 62, USS Fitzgerald completed sea trials last week and it’s on track for redelivery in the first half of this year.At Newport News CVN 79, Kennedy was christened and subsequently launched in December and has successfully transitioned into final assembly and test activities at the pier as we bring the ship systems to life. The ship is approximately 69% complete and performance remains in line with our expectations. CVN 73, USS George Washington has transitioned into its final outfitting and test phase. The refueling and complex overhaul is approximately 68% complete and the ship is scheduled for redelivery to the Navy in late 2021.On the submarine program, SSN 794, Montana achieved the pressure hall complete milestone in December and remains on track to deliver in the first half of 2021. And SSN 796, New Jersey is on track to achieve the pressure haul complete milestone in late 2020. In our Technical Solutions segment performance remains healthy across the business. For example, our teams continue to do a great job supporting the Air Force with training and ISR activities both domestically and abroad. Performance is strong at key department of energy sites, including Los Alamos, Savannah River and the Nevada National Security site with more Department of Energy, new business opportunities on the horizon.And we continue to support Boeing as their key partner in the production of the extra large unmanned undersea vehicle. And with the acquisition of Hydroid, we are well positioned to compete for future unmanned undersea and surface vehicles. TS ended the year with a lot of momentum, heading into 2020. And their recent portfolio shaping activities create a sharpened focus for the business, which will allow them to create innovative solutions for growing and evolving customer requirements.In summary, I’m very excited about where we are as a company. Our shipbuilding programs continue to be well supported in Washington and we have captured a record $46 billion backlog that provides unmatched stability and visibility. We are creating modern recapitalized facilities to efficiently execute our contracts and we are seeing improving operational performance that produce shipbuilding return on sales, that was right in line with our expectations in 2019. And we have a well trained workforce that is laser-focused on execution while driving continuous improvement, innovation and creativity.In addition, our recent portfolio shaping activities create a sharpened focus in the technical solutions business, and position the team to capture growth opportunities in unmanned systems, defense and federal solutions, and nuclear and environmental services. The acquisition of Hydroid is particularly exciting as we combine this entity with our unmanned maritime systems business unit to form one of the leading autonomous and unmanned maritime systems companies in the world.I firmly believe that we are taking the right steps to drive growth, manage risk, and generate strong returns, which will in turn continue to create long term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers, and our employees.So now I will turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year consolidated results and provide some additional information on how we view 2020. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website.As Mike mentioned earlier, we continued to refine our areas of strategic focus within the technical solutions division. We recently announced the acquisition of Hydroid, which we expect will close by the end of the first quarter. The total purchase price is $350 million. This represents a multiple of approximately 16 times, expected 2020 EBITDA, when adjusting for approximately $50 million of related tax benefits.Moving on our oil and gas business, UPI is now considered an asset held for sale and as reflected as such on our balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we recorded a $35 million non-cash asset impairment charge, primarily related to goodwill associated with the valuation of UPI as we prepare to divest that business.UPI had a very good year in 2019 and they have a strong backlog moving forward. Excluding the impact of the impairment at UPI, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $4.36 and $14.01 for the full year. GAAP diluted EPS was $3.61 for the quarter and $13.26 for the full year.Turning into our consolidated fourth quarter results on Slide 4 of the presentation, revenues in the quarter of $2.4 billion increased 9.7% over fourth quarter 2018, primarily due to higher volumes in submarine construction for Virginia and Columbia class boats in Newport News, and growth in our Technical Solutions division, due primarily to the acquisitions of G2 and Fulcrum. For the quarter, G2 and Fulcrum contributed revenues of approximately $55 million.Operating income for the quarter of $186 million, decreased $27 million or 12.7% from fourth quarter of 2018 and operating margin of 7.7%, decreased 197 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment and an asset impairment charge related to our oil and gas business.Moving onto consolidated results for the full year on Slide 5, revenues were $8.9 billion for the year, an increase of 8.8% from 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher volumes in aircraft carriers, submarines and Navy nuclear support services in Newport News and growth in our Technical Solutions division, due primarily to the acquisitions of G2 and Fulcrum, as well as higher fleet support in oil and gas revenues. For the year, G2 and Fulcrum contributed revenues of approximately $201 million.Operating income for the year was $736 million and operating margin was 8.3%. This compares to operating income of $951 million and operating margin of 11.6% in 2018. The decreases were primarily due to a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment compared to 2018, an asset impairment charge related to our oil and gas business and losses on a fleet support services contract, as well as lower risk retirement at Ingalls.These were partially offset by contract changes on submarine support services, higher volume in Newport News and higher risk retirement on the CVN 73 RCOH contract. Our effective income tax rate was 13.4% for the quarter and 19.6% for the full year. This compares to 3.2% and 13.9% for fourth quarter and full year 2018 respectively. The lower tax rates in 2018 were driven by higher estimated research and development tax credits for the 2011 through 2018 tax years.Turning to cash flow on Slide 6 of the presentation, cash from operations was $566 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $408 million. For the full year, cash from operations was $896 million and free cash flow was $460 million. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $150 million and for the year, capital expenditures were $436 million or 4.9% of sales. Cash contributions to our pension and post retirement benefit plans were $59 million in the year, of which $21 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified plans.Additionally, we repurchased approximately 254,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $58 million, bringing the total number of shares repurchased in 2019 to approximately 1 million at a cost of $214 million. We also paid dividends of $1.03 per share or $42 million in the quarter, bringing total dividends paid for the year to $149 million.Now turning to Slide 7, let me provide an update on pension. As we announced in late January, we will adopt the Safe Harbor methodology for CAS pension cost accounting beginning in 2021. The transition to Safe Harbor method reduces CAS pension costs volatility and improves program cost predictability. While the transition does create an unfavorable impact to GAAP EPS starting in 2021, it is cash flow neutral over the long term.As you can see on the pension table provided on Slide 7. Cash recoveries and cash contributions become fairly well matched beginning in 2021 and moving forward. For ease of analysis, we’ll expect or we expect to begin providing EPS adjusted for FAS/CAS adjustment starting with first quarter 2020 results.Now let me provide you with an update on some additional 2020 items as shown on Slide 8. We expect shipbuilding revenue to grow between 3% and 5% in 2020. We expect shipbuilding return on sales to be 9% in 2020, with the majority of significant risk retirement events weighted towards the latter part of the year, resulting in shipbuilding return on sales averaging 8% for the first three quarters.Regarding Technical Solutions and given the recent portfolio shaping events underway, we expect revenues to be approximately $1 billion in 2020. This figure excludes results from UPI in the San Diego shipyard and assumes the Hydroid acquisition closes in the first quarter of 2020. Also for Technical Solutions, we expect return on sales to be in the 5% to 7% range.On Slide 8, we’ve also provided 2020 modeling considerations for your reference, including taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures. Finally, on Slide 9, we’ve provided an updated view of anticipated major shipbuilding program milestones for 2020 and 2021.That concludes my remarks. I’ll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people from the queue as possible. Josh, I’ll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. You may proceed with your question.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering on the free cash flow for 2019 kind of where did that came out versus your expectations. And then maybe as you look at capital deployment, you didn’t really pick up the repurchase effort in the fourth quarter and wondering if that reverses significantly in 2020?
Mike Petters: Yes. So cash in Q4 was a little bit below expectation – $50 million to $60 million below, it was only timing with some receipts primarily at Newport News, that weren’t paid. That shifted into 2020. So not really concerned about that, that is normalizing. Relative to capital deployment, we really don’t see a change. We’re going to invest in our shipyards continue to comply with our commitment relative to dividends and analyze that throughout the year. But still the 10% increase – at least a 10% increase this year and then continuous share buyback, it was pretty consistent in 2019 with previous years in share buyback, obviously in 2018, we’re pretty opportunistic, but really no change there.
Myles Walton: But still the band aid is to return versus all cash – free cash flow to shareholders.
Mike Petters: No. There is no change in that commitment. That commitment to 2020 definitely stands.
Myles Walton: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Two quick ones. One Mike, if you could just speak to the Hydroid acquisition and unmanned and the longer term growth opportunity, maybe in a little bit more detail how you see the competitive landscape and that part of the market evolving, I realize there’s a lot going on. But any color there would be helpful. And then just on housekeeping, Chris, I wondered if you might give us the EACs gross and net? Thanks.
Chris Kastner: Let me do that, housekeeping, first. Yes. So positive is $89 million, negative $50 million, net plus $39 million. About 90% of that was Newport News.
Carter Copeland: Awesome. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Sure. Okay. Relative to Hydroid, we began – I guess, we identified the Navy’s potential to move towards more unmanned systems several years ago. And we recognize that while we had engineered out a lot of manpower on the Ford design, that was not what – that was not where the Navy was talking about. They were talking about unmanned vehicles in particular, and we didn’t really have a footprint there. We – you recall, we invested in a small company in Panama City that had a platform called Proteus, which was a two man or unmanned, or it was both, either or could be operated with two people or be unmanned platform that was actually in the water and being tested and being used by many customers, not just the Navy.We acquired that group and the first thing we found out was that there’s a whole set of technologies and customers and people and processes that we were not very familiar with. And so not only did we get some technology there, we got some access. And in the course of that access, we then realize that, we can bring some of our own core capability to this area that might actually accelerate the adoption of the technology as well as create a business for us.And that led to an arrangement with Boeing, who had invested in their large unmanned vehicle. They’d actually put it at sea, but they needed somebody to build it. So we could bring our manufacturing expertise to bear on that. We did that. We’ve, and in the course of that, we kind of realized that, okay, we’re starting to really get an understanding of these large unmanned undersea vehicles. But when we looked around, we saw there’s a lot of activity on the smaller side. And Hydroid was a company that we noticed was really a big player in the smaller UUV space.And so we began a journey and a process with Kongsberg to walk our way through and resulting in the acquisition we hope. We’ve signed the agreement and we hope to close that deal, but that gives us a footprint in basically the full range of unmanned undersea capability. And it speaks to a larger kind of belief that I have, personally, is that – I mean the Navy can have lots of things that they say they need and lots of things that they want to do, but they need to do that when the industry can get there and provide it for them, they can go a lot faster.And so our view is, let’s bring some of our capability, our ability to build workforce, our technology, our manufacturing expertise, our contact information. Let’s bring all of that to bear in this space to accelerate the development of the unmanned space on behalf of our customer. And so we think that this is a step in that direction. As you say, there’s a lot going on in there. And but I would say that there’s a lot of folks who could talk about this scientifically. What I would tell you is that, if you’re in the water, you’re learning about it and we’re in the water. And so we’re really happy about that and we’re optimistic about where this business is going to go.
Chris Kastner: Yes. I would also add that, that business just organically posts the transaction getting complete with in HII will grow at high single digits. So that’s the near term growth rate we see in that business. So we believe it can only get better beyond that.
Carter Copeland: That was going to be my follow-up. Thanks for the color, gents.
Mike Petters: You bet sir.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. You may proceed with your question.
Jon Raviv: Thanks very much. Good morning. On the – just following up on a cash flow question, I know, you mentioned, $50 million to $60 million rely on Newport News receipts, something in the 2020. Any other big building blocks we should think about heading into this year. CapEx come down a bit perhaps. Anything else we should keep in mind in terms of underlying cash flow?
Chris Kastner: Not really, as you’re aware, this is the last year of our major capital program and we get back down to 2.5% of sales in 2021. What you’re going to see over the near term is us start ramping our free cash such that we become a $700 million a year cash flow story. Now I can’t tell you whether that happens in 2021, 2022 or 2023, we’re going to ramp towards that. But at the end of the day, $700 million becomes the new normal for HII for free cash flow.
Jon Raviv: And just to clarify, Chris, that’s a with or without pension benefit?
Chris Kastner: That’s all in.
Jon Raviv: Okay, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on margin cadence, can you talk a little more on the back loaded nature of this year. I know, in the last call, you mentioned that there could be some – probably what’s the comp…
Chris Kastner: Yes. Sure. The major items, the back half of the year, our delivery of NSC 9, 796 getting to pressure all complete and then bringing to life CVN 72, excuse me, CVN 73 and CVN 79 to their test program.
Jon Raviv: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed with your question.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. I want to go back to, Mike, the discussion about unmanned systems. And last week, Secretary Esper talked about moving to a very different kind of 355-ship Navy in 2030, which is I think it’s pretty aggressive with smaller platforms, lower manning, including optionally manned. I asked you a while back about this, as it related to the Marine core strategy that had been laid out, but if the Navy moves aggressively in this direction, how might that affect your core programs, the larger ships and your business mix? And what’s your understanding of how the Navy is looking to proceed here?
Mike Petters: Well, Doug, I think, this is – this continues to evolve. The Navy is trying to match up the requirements that they see out in the world that they feel like they need with the ability of the industry to support it. And so our view of that is that we need to be on the front edge of that and trying to help them evolve that.Relative to our core business though, I mean our strategy for the last three years, if you go back over the last three years, the shipbuilding accounts have been historically high, doesn’t actually talk about how high they’ve been. I mean, my whole career, they’ve been in the $14 billion to $16 billion a year, year-in and year-out. And for the last three years anyway, we’ve been just short of $25 billion, even this year that for all of the discussion over the past few days about what’s going on with the shipbuilding budget and all that sort of thing, it’s still at $20 billion.And so I think that where you’re going to see is, you’re not going to see a hard left turn here where we’re going to say, okay, we don’t need big platforms with people on them anymore and we’re going to make – we’re going to have a Navy that’s completely unmanned and think what you’re going to see is an evolution. You’re going to see the unmanned space become amplification of the presence and platforms that the Navy needs. And so I don’t know how that counting works and all that sort of thing because that becomes an interesting discussion about what actually counts as a ship and I just kind of stay out of that.I think about it more in terms of capability to provide presence for the Navy and the ability of the industry to bring technology to bear on the problems that they have. I think that the Navy is going to be moving towards more unmanned systems to amplify the platforms that they have and then see where that goes from there. And we want to be as their principal partner, we want to be right there with them and help them make that successful.
Doug Harned: Well. When you think about growth I think of shipbuilding as a fairly predictable business because – on top line, because of the very long contracts. And you’ve talked about five-year growth rate of around 3%. But this year you gave – you’re giving revenue guidance of 3% to 5%. What factors create that range of outcomes? Is this repair work or uncertainty about the timing of milestones? I mean, how do you get that, that broader range this year in guidance?
Mike Petters: There’s really some minor timing issues that could move it between 3% and 5% on some of our programs. It’s not really new programs drive that, although timing of some material on some of the new awards would help us out of that. But the majority of that as you indicate is already under contract.
Doug Harned: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning. Mike, could you give us a little more maybe background of color on the $950 million contract that you guys got in ISR work for the Tech services division, right? And that’s doing support work for the Air Force in Europe, right? So if you could give us some more background on that? And then I have a follow-on question.
Chris Kastner: Yes. So that’s – Ron, this is Chris. That’s Air Force contract, Persistent Multi-Role Operations, ISR contract that’s split over four or five years, all that revenue. And we’re really excited about it. We’ve done similar work through one of our acquisitions. So this is essentially follow-on with a different scope. I can’t really go into too much detail what they’re doing. I got to be careful on the call. But we’re really excited about that. We think it’s an important area going forward.
Ron Epstein: Okay. And then, Mike, just maybe a broader question. One of the things that’s come up in some of the conversations that we’ve had around Naval strategy. Do you – are you up to view, do you see a future, where there’s more underwater operations beyond just kind of the typical Virginia class, Columbia class, that there’s going to be a need for a broader underwater infrastructure and met this unmanned underwater play as part of potentially building out broader underwater infrastructure?
Mike Petters: Well, Ron, I remind you that you’re talking to a former submarine officer. So I need to kind of do my Safe Harbor on that. But the thing about the undersea environment and platforms in the undersea environment is that they are very asymmetric. There’s lots of history of a single submarine can bottle up an entire fleet in port. And the fact that you can look out across the harbor and can’t see it, gives it an advantage. And so being undersea is a multiplier just that, just the simple fact that your underwater is a multiplier for the your capability. There’s a lot of things that you can do underwater that you may not want to send a Virginia class submarine with a bunch of people on it to go do.And so being able to – on the other hand, there’s a significant amount of things underwater that you want to be able to do that you want to have a Virginia class submarine or something like that, fully man, fully capable of complying with rules of engagement and all that sort of thing. You want to be able to do that too. And so what we see is that this asymmetry that comes from being undersea is going to be something that the Navy has to find a way to take advantage of. And if you just go back, gosh, it’s getting to be close to 30 years now, but you go back and start to look at how did the unmanned aerial systems take off, right? There was a technology that was being developed and we were kind of doing this and then suddenly there was a knee in the curve where nobody could get enough of it. Everybody wanted more and there wasn’t enough capacity. I mean, literally the curve just shot almost vertical.We’ve been talking in the unmanned space for probably 10 years or 15 years about when is the knee in the curve going to come for the unmanned space, undersea – the unmanned undersea space. I would say the undersea space is a much harder environment in terms of the physics of it. And I’m not sure the knee in the curve is going to look like the unmanned aerial vehicles space did. I believe you’re starting to see now the maturation of technologies, more and more folks are getting in the water and they’re getting to understand what the art of the possible is. And so there – whether it’s a knee in the curve or if it’s just an acceleration. I think we’re kind of getting there now.And so it’s really important for us to be in the middle of all of that. And I think that 15 years from now you could see it – you can see a Navy that is talking a lot more about what they can and want to do undersea. I just think that’s where it goes. The final thing, I’d say, Ron is, this is just my own personal amateur historian view is that, when countries can no longer afford the full Navy that they want, they buy submarines because they’re asymmetric for the money that you put into them. So, I mean, I think we have history that says that, I don’t know that it’ll quite play out that way here because presence is important, and presence actually keeps conflict from becoming hot conflict. And so I think the Navy has a great understanding of that. But in marriage, I think it’s marrying undersea capability with the presence is a way for us to go.
Ron Epstein: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.
Robert Spingarn: Well, good morning. I wanted to ask you for a little more detail on shipbuilding margin both forward and also Q4 2019 from the perspective of the CVN 79? So trying to understand you book that very conservatively in the beginning of the program, I think we were looking for some kind of write-up upon launch. So Chris, can you tell us anything about CVN 79 EACs in Q4? And then maybe the other way to look at this is how does the 9% in 2020 divide between Ingalls and Newport News and what’s happening with the carrier relative to plan?
Chris Kastner: Well, I’ll comment on margin, then Mike, you can talk about CVN 79, if you like. But Q4, 79 met their milestone. We evaluated the risk and I had previously indicated that there’s a lot of risk in front of us on that ships. So it just simply wasn’t material enough – material enough of an issue to mention. But we did our very good Q4 in shipbuilding both Ingalls and Newport News actually. In 2020, I expect both Newport News and Ingalls be at 9%. I expect them both to get there.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Just on the carrier, I mean, was I wrong in thinking that the launch would release a fair amount of positive EAC or is it next year’s Q4 with the system build out milestone that you’re talking about?
Mike Petters: Yes, I think that was our view of this is that the risk that we incurred on the Ford was really in the test program, which is kind of we’re walking into the test program now on Kennedy and we just – we’re going to be conservative about this. The Ford actually for a lead ship came together better than any lead ship I’ve ever seen. But as we tested systems, we had to work our way through a whole bunch of new technology there. So this is our next go on that. And we’re going to continue to be pretty conservative on that until we actually retire those risks. And I don’t think we ever really expected that launch would be open the floodgates on risk retirement. We just, frankly, the early launch that the program team put together was a way for us to mitigate downstream risk. And that’s, it was part of a step, but not a floodgate.
Robert Spingarn: Are you on plan with 79?
Mike Petters: We are.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro. You may proceed with your question.
George Shapiro: Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to follow – good morning. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit in the last question from Rob. Can you just give us the specific EACs in the quarter and then also can you explain, you mentioned that you got to pick up in margin on the Block V contract. So that assumes that the contract was more favorable than what you might’ve thought before. If you could comment on that. And then also the other benefit that you had there on the LA class ships the support services increase in margin.
Chris Kastner: Yes. So Block V in Columbus, neither one is material enough to mention the number. It’s all included in the Newport News results. I can’t get back to your first question, George. I don’t even recall it. What was the first question again?
George Shapiro: Like, what are the EACs?
Chris Kastner: I already gave that to [indiscernible] at the beginning. It was gross favorable of 89% unfavorable of 50%, 90% of that being Newport News.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then how about the support contract changes for the LA class that you referenced? I mean, can you be a little more specific what they were?
Mike Petters: No. They were all embedded in Newport News performance in the quarter.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then just one more general one, Mike. You looked in detail at the 21 budget for shipbuilding. Do you think that Congress leaves it as is? I mean, there are quite a bit of changes, right? One less destroyer, one less Virginia-class to also support Columbia.
Mike Petters: Well, George, I’m going to suggest that, I’m not sure that I’ve ever seen the Congress leave any part of the administration’s budget as is. And so I think that the budget submission is a beginning of a process. It’s a long process to go from submitting the budget to appropriating the bills. And I’m not talking about just defense, I’m talking about all of the areas of the budget. So I think it’s going to – our role in this is typically to talk to – if that’s what you want, what’s the most efficient way to do it? So that’s kind of the way we work this and we’ve worked it over the years and sometimes it works out and sometimes it’s not necessarily the way we would like. But I think we’re just at the very beginning of the process right now and it’s going to play out over the next several months.
George Shapiro: What in it would you like to have changed?
Mike Petters: Well, I think the biggest issue is the one that we’ve been talking about here all along. And that is that you got to find a way to pay for Columbia. If you decide that you’re going to pay for Columbia inside the shipbuilding account, then it’s going to squeeze ships out unless you’re going push the budget up. And in the last three years, I think that, at the very beginning of the ramp up into Columbia at a time when our strategy was take advantage of the budget and get as much stuff under contract as you possibly can, because there’s going to come a time where you’re going to have a lot of arm wrestling over the budget. And I think we’ve done that very well and that’s how we ended up with the backlog that we have.But I think the uncertainty about how you’re going to pay for Columbia is going to show up. And I think that’s what really showed up here. The pluses and minuses were really squeezed out because you have to go pay for Columbia. And I absolutely think we have to go pay for it and I think that’s a national priority. But I just think it’s going to be, it’s the elephant in the room that has to be dealt with if you want to keep all the other programs going. So I think that’s where this ultimately goes. Each ship, certainly we’d like to see – more ships are better and they’re better not just for us, but they’re better for the whole industry. So we’ll continue to advocate for that. But that’s a way to keep the industrial base healthy and happy.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. You may proceed with your question.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, guys. Bit of a follow-on. Mike, how are you feeling about the outlook for big deck amphibs at Ingalls right now? I know you’ve been trying to kind of bring one of the ships forward in the Navy’s plan, Congress has helped out a little bit I think. And we’ve got the new budget. How are you feeling about that right now?
Mike Petters: Well, I feel pretty good about it. Frankly, the Marine Core wants it, the Congress is trying to find ways to push it through. I just think it’s an example, some of the pluses and minuses. I think what you see in the budget is really the squeezing, there’s only so much air that can go into the balloon from the budget submission standpoint. So I feel pretty good about it. I think that there’s a lot of support for what the big deck amphibs can do and what they are doing out there today. And so, I remain optimistic about where that’s going to ultimately end up. There’s going to be days when we feel really good about it and days when we kind of wonder where it’s going on. But I think in total it’s going to be – we’re going to end up in a good place and a good outcome.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. Got it. Just one follow-up for me. On the sale of Continental Maritime to Carlyle, I don’t think it’s a lot of revenue, maybe $100 million or so. But I thought it was always viewed as a positive to have a repair yard on the West Coast for you guys. So I’m just wondering, how you’re thinking about that now?
Mike Petters: We contributed, just to be clear, we contributed this asset so that now we’re part of the joint venture. So our view is that the business model – let me step back. I think I’ve talked about this before. There is more demand for repair activity in the Pacific area of responsibility than there is capacity to provide it right now. But the Navy is kind of trying to work its way through a business model that’s going to allow for more efficient support for the requirements that they have.In our case, we’ve – as the business model has changed, we’ve kind of struggled with that a little bit. Our view is, we needed to restructure this business anyway. Here’s a way for us to keep our hand in that business and be able to help the Navy figure out the right way to get the business restructured and get the business – get the industry in a place where it can actually effectively support what the Navy’s doing. I mean, we’ve had cases where in a space where there is not enough capacity to meet the demand, we’ve actually had operations that have been closed.And so you have to step back and say, there’s something bigger going on here and we need to be part of that. So we need to be part of that discussion. But we also have to make sure that, we try to find a solution. And this is what we think is – working with Carlyle and Stellex and Vigor and MHI, the other assets that are there. We think this is a way for us to effectively engage and help the Navy find a solution.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. So you’re not losing either from that, because of the accounting change, you’re losing the revenue for the guidance.
Mike Petters: Correct.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. Thanks guys.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Co. You may proceed with your question.
Jeff Molinari: Hi. Good morning. This is Jeff Molinari on for Gautam today. Thanks for taking my questions. So just some cleanups, all the questions had been answered already. So TS sales has guided to be $1 billion, few more moving pieces than normal. What are you kind of assuming for annualized sales, even margins for Hydroid and the businesses to be divested or excluded because of the JV? Three moving pieces if you could just kind of size those for us, it’d be helpful. Thanks.
Chris Kastner: Yes. So we haven’t provided that and we think given the $1 billion of sales and 5% to 7% return on sales, I should probably get you there from a modeling standpoint. But we haven’t provided that data as of yet.
Jeff Molinari: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the margins, we talked about shipbuilding margins kind of 8% through the first three quarters and then bumping up substantially in Q4. How do you think about that momentum continuing into 2021 at that level?
Mike Petters: Well, I think that, if you look at this business quarter-by-quarter, you’re bound to have good surprises and maybe not so good. But I think that what we know is that and our experience here is that over the long haul, this business executes – the shipbuilding industry executes at around 9%. So I think over the long haul, that’s where we are. And our ambition is to execute our backlog that you see out there at that level or better. And so that’s kind of the way we’re seeing this. The driver that we’re seeing for this specific year is still a little bit of the hangover of the maturation of the backlog.And we’ve gone through a couple of years where we’ve had a heavy weighted portfolio towards brand new work. We just added two more carriers and a whole another set of submarines into that mix. And it takes a little while to start to accumulate the milestones that we need to get them up. But we think that we’re pretty sustainable here over the long haul.
Jeff Molinari: Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the color guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: So Mike, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the frigate and are you still expecting an award this July? And kind of how you’re thinking about the positioning there and how that could ultimately fit in with the kind of work in Ingall?
Mike Petters: Well, the bids are in and we put our best foot forward. We have invested in some facilities and we have a very robust execution plan to be able to build that platform. And we’re just standing by to help the Navy decide what they want to do. Now the competition is tough, I’ll say that. But we’re still expecting award in the first half of the year.
Seth Seifman: Okay. And then maybe a real quick follow up. Chris, the working capital still pretty low as a percentage of sales about 6% and if you had the $50 million of receipts in the fourth quarter, probably even would have been down slightly a percentage of sales year-on-year. Is that a maintainable level of working capital that sort of 6%? So the business grows, working capital dollars maybe up slightly but not significantly.
Chris Kastner: It’ll move around a bit from time to time, but I think 6% is a really good target for shipbuilding.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
David Strauss: So I think previously you had talked about 9% to 10% margin range for shipbuilding in 2020. Is 10% not doable anymore? And in 2020 is 10% still kind of an aspirational target looking further out.
Chris Kastner: David, this is Chris. It was simply coming to our plan and seeing how the programs were going to unfold in 2020 and the risk retirement potential there, which allowed us to arrive at the 9%. We’re going to have quarters that are better than 9% and worse than 9%. We always challenge the organization to do better. But I think the best way to think about it is 9% moving forward.
David Strauss: Okay. And then probably another one for you, Chris. The $700 million in free cash flow, you talked about getting to. Can you – I guess, building off of what you did in 2019 at $460 million, I know you’ve got CapEx coming down over the course of the next couple of years, probably helps by about $200 million. But it looks like, pension, CAS less contribution is about equivalent kind of headwind. So what takes us from $460 million to $700 million?
Chris Kastner: Well, it’s growth, right? We’re going to grow. Margin is improving as well. So you couple that with the reduced capital expenditures and pension normalizing and reaching milestones on ships, you get to $700 million. It’s going to naturally float up to $700 million of free cash over the next two years.
David Strauss: Okay. Thanks.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. You may proceed with your question.
Joseph DeNardi: Yes. Good morning Mike, just on the margin profile of the business going forward. I get that that there’s a cost plus component of your business that that’s probably greater than some of your peers. But if you look out over the next several years, it’s more of the production, the fixed price side of the business that will be growing. And so, longer term, why is it that a margin tailwind potentially such that maybe the margin profile can go from 9% to 10% to 10% to 12% at some point? Thank you.
Mike Petters: Well, I mean, I wish I could say that you were right. But the fact is that the whole blend ends up and if you go now and we’ve gone back and looked at this every which way you can look at it. You end up in a place where no matter where you are. The first thing you want to do is, you want to know that you’re actually executing well. And that’s where the whole discussion around 9% to 10% came from was, you’re executing well, if you’re in that range and you have a good mix of new programs and mature programs. If you’re out of that range high, that means that you’re probably overweighted on mature programs. And if you’re out of that range low, you’re either not executing well or you’re out of balance with new programs.So that’s kind of where it came from. And right now, with a $46 billion backlog, our work kind of on the heavy end on new programs. We’ve gone through a couple of years where we’ve been maturing programs, but we just added $20-some-billion to the backlog last year. So we’re going to continue to work our risk through that. But the other side of it is, that if you just go and look at the entire industry over the last, I don’t know, 10 or 15 years, the industry just tends to operate at 9%. And that’s takes in account of mature programs and new programs and everything else. And so we aspire to 10%. We push our teams to that level and that’s our ambition. But I think in terms of the way to think about our businesses, this is a 9% business with a $46 billion backlog that plays out over the next 10 or 12 years.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay. That’s helpful. Could you maybe quantify, just given submarine growth and carrier transitioning from cost to fix. What the mix looks like as you see it five years from now in terms of costs versus fixed as a whole. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: The way to think about that is the RCOH contracts are the cost plus contracts moving forward. So I don’t have a specific percentage, but that’s really the majority of the cost plus work in our base.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Noah Poponak: Chris, just wanted to try the walk from today’s free cash to $700 million, again, because it sounded, if I heard your answer to David’s question correctly, it really comes down to just growth in the segments but with CapEx and pension largely offsetting. But if it’s a $9 billion business growing top line, 3% to 4% with margins in the zone of flat, that’s only kind of $20 million, $25 million share of free cash flow growth per year. Should I – is there something in grant proceeds that have been large for you recently or something else outside of the segments? Or is it just more when you said it could be 2021, 2022, 2023 that it’s likely to the backend of that when you’ve had time to compound the segments?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So there’s some compounding there. But it’s also the timing of the milestones and how that works through working capital. When you look at our plans and all our ships going through our plans over the next three years it gets to $700 million and that really becomes the new normal. So I think you’ve essentially got it right, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And then when you’ve stated that now pointing to 9% as a shipbuilding margin versus the prior comments of 9% to 10%. You stated that, that’s really just kind of honing in on the specific plan as you’ve moved into 2020 itself? Can you help us with the specific things that changed in the plan? What specific ship inputs are different versus what you thought previously?
Chris Kastner: No, there’s really nothing specific that I would drop on Noah there. It’s just going through each ship, laying them out over the next few years and looking at the risk retirement opportunities and the risk on those ships that 9% was the best way to look at it.
Noah Poponak: Okay. So it’s more of just moving to a bottoms up ship by ship plan versus a prior sort of directional what the business is capable of type of framework.
Chris Kastner: And some of it is the fact that we, the previous plan had these – a lot of these contracts we didn’t have. So it is working through the large volume of contracting as it comes into our plan now. And how is that going to play out with our teams and our execution and all of that. So we just felt like it’s really important to kind of clarify that.
Noah Poponak: I see. Okay. Thanks so much.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Noah.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Petters for any further remarks.

With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.2 billion for the quarter were approximately 6.5% higher than 2018, and diluted EPS was $3.74. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $2 billion resulting in backlog of approximately $39 billion at the end of the quarter of which $17.8 billion is funded.Turning to capital deployment for a moment. Earlier this week, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.86 per share to $1.03 per share. We also increased our share repurchase program from the most recent authority of $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion and extended the term from October 2022 to October 2024. These decisions demonstrate continued confidence in the free cash flow generation of the business that supports our path to 2020 commitment to return substantially all free cash flow to our shareholders.Regarding activities in Washington, we are encouraged that the House and Senate are conferencing the National Defense Authorization Bill and are hopeful that a timely conference agreement will be produced for fiscal year 2020. We are very pleased with strong support for shipbuilding by the Senate Appropriations Committee, which included funding for surface combatants, submarines, amphibious warships, aircraft carriers and autonomous platforms. In particular, acceleration of both LPD-31 and LHA 9, the fiscal year 2020 will best leverage the high production lines and supply chains for amphibious warships and incremental funding will permit the Pentagon to efficiently balance investment for these ships across the future years defense plan. While the government is currently operating at our continuing resolution through late November, we continue to urge the Congress to pass final appropriations measures as quickly as possible.Now let me share a few business segment highlights from the quarter. At Ingalls, the team achieved completion of external structural work on NSC 9 Stone in July and the ship was launched in early October. Cost performance remains in line with our expectations and the ship is anticipated to be delivered late next year. DDG 119, Delbert D. Black, continues to recover from the impact of the incident earlier this year and is planned to be delivered in the first half of next year. LPD 28, Fort Lauderdale performance remains favorable and the next significant milestone for this ship is launched, planned for the first half of next year. And on LHA-7 Tripoli, the team recently completed acceptance trials and is on track for delivery in late 2019 or early 2020. At Newport News, CVN 73 USS George Washington was undocked at the end of September and moved to an outfitting birth where final outfitting and testing activities will be performed. The refueling and complex overhaul is now more than 60% complete and the ship is expected to be redelivered to the Navy in late 2021.CVN 79 Kennedy is on track for launch, starting with flooding the dry dock and floating the ship last week. The team is preparing to ship for her christening ceremony on December 7 and planning for exit from the dry dock by the end of the year. That ship is approximately 67% complete and performance remains in line with our expectations. On the submarine program, SSN 791 Delaware delivered in late October and SSN 794 Montana, our first Block IV delivery remains on track to achieve the pressure hull complete milestone next month with delivery planned for the first half of 2021.And finally, the Block V contract is on track for award by the end of this year. This is an exciting and extremely productive time for our shipbuilding teams. Over the past month or so, we have undocked CVN 73 USS George Washington, delivered SSN 791 Delaware, completed acceptance trials on LHA-7 Tripoli, started the process for launch of CVN 79 Kennedy and completed sea trials for the post-shakedown availability and redelivered USS Gerald R. Ford to the Navy. All of these activities demonstrate an operating rhythm that supports achieving shipbuilding operating margins of 9% to 10% in 2020. And regarding the Ford, completion of sea trials is another step towards completing the most complex Navy ship ever produced. The manufacturing of this ship incorporated numerous new technologies and systems, including the advanced weapons elevators and these technologies performed well on the recent sea trials. This is both exciting and rewarding. I have spoken directly with both Secretary Spencer and Assistant Secretary, Geurts and we are aligned on the plan to get the ship ready for deployment as soon as possible. We have a great team that includes Newport News Shipbuilding, the Navy and other industry experts and I am confident that our collective efforts on Ford will bring superior capability to the Navy and to our nation for decades to come.In our Technical Solutions segment, the team performed well across the portfolio, focusing on execution of existing contracts while capturing new business awards to help set the stage for growth. For example, TS continue to provide critical support to the Department of Energy through multiple contracts at the Savannah River, Los Alamos and Nevada nuclear site. And is pursuing additional opportunities for growth in the DOE and nuclear markets. Along with their bowing teammate, TS began to ramp-up production of XLUUV, the Navy's flagship UUV program that has significant potential for long-term growth. Aside from XLUUV, TS is also pursuing several other critical new programs in the unmanned undersea and unmanned surface vehicle markets. And TS also recently won a large number -- won a number of large multiple-award contracts that provide new opportunities for growth, including a Defense Intelligence Agency contract to provide analytic and operational support services to maintain global situational awareness of threats to our nation and our allies. A NAVWAR contract to provide a float C4ISR installation services and a contract to provide network architecture and cybersecurity services to the U.S. Air Force.Overall, Technical Solutions performance in the quarter was solid, and the team remains positioned to achieve low single-digit top line growth and 5% to 7% margin in 2020. In summary, I am encouraged by the Senate Appropriation Committee's recognition of the need to leverage the high production lines and supply chain for amphibious warship, and I am very pleased with the shipbuilding results that create a path to achieve -- to achieving 9% to 10% shipbuilding margin in 2020. I am also very pleased with the progress being made on multiple fronts by our Technical Solutions segments, we are taking the right steps to position the company for the future and our team is laser-focused on efficiently executing our significant backlog in order to drive long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. And now I will turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Christopher Kastner: Thanks, Mike, good morning. As I review our third quarter financial result, you may follow along with the slide presentation we posted this morning on our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation, our third quarter revenues of $2.2 billion increased 6.5% compared to the same period last year primarily due to growth in our Technical Solutions division due primarily to the acquisitions of G2 and Fulcrum and higher volumes in Aircraft Carrier and submarine programs at Newport News. Operating income in the quarter of $214 million decreased $76 million or 26.2% from third quarter 2018, an operating margin of 9.6% decreased 428 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by a lower operating FAS/CAS adjustment compared to the prior year as well as lower segment operating income. Primarily due to a $43 million benefit at Newport News related to workers' compensation in the third quarter of 2018, partially offset by contract changes in the current period for submarine fleet support services.Turning to Slide 5 of the presentation. Cash from operations was $363 million in the quarter, and net capital expenditures were $113 million or 5.1% of revenues compared to cash used in operations of $93 million or $102 million of net capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2018. Through the third quarter, net capital expenditures totaled $278 million. We expect the capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately 5% of sales.During the quarter, we contributed $25 million in our pension and postretirement benefit plans, of which $16 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified plans. We also repurchased approximately 322,000 shares at a cost of $68 million and paid dividends of $0.86 per share or $35 million, bringing our quarter-end cash balance to $32 million. At quarter end, we had $264 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility.Moving on to Slide 6 of the presentation. Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $647 million decreased $47 million from the same period last year due to lower volumes on the NSC and LHA programs. Ingalls' operating income of $61 million and margin of 9.4% in the quarter were down from third quarter of 2018, mainly due to lower risk retirement on the NSC program.Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation. Newport News revenues of $1.3 billion in the quarter increased 7.2% from the same period last year, mostly due to higher volumes in aircraft carrier and submarine constructions. Newport News operating income of $109 million and margin of 8.6% in the quarter were down year-over-year, primarily due to a workers' compensation benefit of $43 million in the same period last year.Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation. Technical solutions revenues of $347 million in the quarter increased 41.6% from the same period last year, mainly due to the acquisitions of G2 and Fulcrum, which collectively contributed $59 million of revenue in the quarter as well as growth in fleet support in oil and gas services revenues.Technical Solutions operating income of $21 million in the quarter compares to operating income of $16 million in the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to improved performance on nuclear and environmental contracts.Turning to Slide 9. We've updated our 2019 and 2020 pension and postretirement benefits outlook. Our 2019 projected CAS expense has declined by $20 million from $298 million to $278 million with no change to our projected FAS expense. This decrease is driven primarily by an update of actuarial estimates resulting from updated demographic and economic assumptions.Projected 2020 total CAS expense has increased by $169 million from our initial outlook to $445 million, primarily due to lower discount rates in 2019, partially offset by an anticipated favorable return on assets in 2019.Consequently, the 2020 FAS/CAS adjustment has also increased from the prior outlook and is now projected to be $276 million for the year. Additionally, our expected 2020 cash contributions have increased by $79 million from our initial outlook to $252 million, of which $216 million is discretionary contributions to our qualified plans. The increase in the cash contribution is primarily due to the lower discount rates.The 2020 projections provided on Slide 9 are based on data as of August month-end, including a FAS discount rate of 2.32%, which has fallen by 111 basis points since our update in February and assumes 2019 asset returns of approximately 14%. Please remember that pension-related numbers are subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria. We will provide updated pension estimates for 2020 and 2021 on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.Finally, we continue to expect that our shipbuilding business will achieve approximately 8% return on sales for the full year and remain confident that margins will ramp to 9% to 10% in 2020.That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. [Operator Instructions]. Michelle, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Mike, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about BCS Block V and the progress there, moving towards the contract. Obviously, the -- it looks like the cost per boat is a little bit higher than originally planned and I think that impacted the quantities. But I wondered if you might give us some color around what that means for the risk profile there versus what you've kind of talked about in the past? Any color there would be helpful.
Michael Petters: Yes. I think it's a good question. We're at the point now in the process where we really need to go to contract. And we've been working very hard with our partners at General Dynamics and with the Navy to fashion a contract that makes sense of the authorization that's out there, the appropriation that's out there and where we see the challenges in the business are going to be. And so I think we're on track for that. And as we said, we're going to -- we're heading to get to a contract by the end of the year. My personal view is that I think, the authorizers have been pretty clear that the more submarines, no matter how many submarines we have, we're going to want more. And I think that the appropriators have tried to balance that with the other priorities that they have. And as a result in our contract negotiations with the Navy, we've worked hard to make sure that we provide good value for the contract. And I think that we're going to create a contract here that's going to have -- that's going to be able to address all of that.
Carter Copeland: Great. And then as a follow-up, Chris, I wondered if you might just give us the EACs for the quarter?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. Sure. The adjustments -- or the cume adjustments for the quarter, gross favorable were 64%, gross unfavorable were 20%. So it's a net of 44%. Of that net, 35% of that was Ingalls, 45% was Newport News, and TS was 20%.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Caius Slater: It's Caius Slater signing in for Doug. So Mike, in the second quarter, you said you'd ask the business leaders to look again at execution and risk management to see if there is any opportunities to improve on that. Just what have they found? What are the challenges? Where are the opportunities? I think, previously, you've talked about eliminating hiccups in execution, but what are the more sort of structural things that you can look at?
Michael Petters: That's a good question. We did sort of go back and do a deep dive into this and try to understand why parts of the business, there are pockets that were handling execution really well, and there were pockets that weren't and we had some inconsistencies there. And so what we're doing at this point is, we're expanding and basically developing a comprehensive operating system that would be the standard protocol for all of the programs that we have in the company. And it's kind of interesting to think that you can have a structure, but then when it gets all the way to the waterfront, it starts to move around a little bit. And so we're going to put some more discipline and scratch into that. And we're on track for it.
Caius Slater: That's great. And then just a quick follow-up on Technical Solutions. The business is there, they appear to be very diverse. So how do you fit all those together? And how do you manage that across a range of customers and service offerings?
Christopher Kastner: Our general operating model in the organization is that we delegate as much authority to the divisions as we can. We want to make sure that the authority and accountability is distributed so that when the divisions are facing their customer, they have the authority to do -- to make the decisions they need to make to support that customer, but with that goes the accountability to get it right. That's the case in shipbuilding and that's the case in Technical Solutions too. Regarding the operating system kind of, in general, the -- you can imagine this becomes here, all the perimeters that we need to consider and include in our -- in how we operate and support a customer. And then in details with the customer, there would be okay. That make sense for this one, that one, we probably need to go deeper on. Here is one that doesn't speak very well to this customer and so we have to work our way through that. Actually, the TS guys do pretty well with that right now, as you can see. And so I don't think it's going to be that hard to bring that -- create an overarching structure for.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: Mike, I was wondering if you could talk about some of the post-delivery liabilities that still exist on the Ford. And maybe at a higher level, talk about warranties versus guarantees for shipbuilding. And in particular, how if at all that's changing going forward with maybe the frigate being one of the experiments?
Michael Petters: Yes. So that's a really complex set of questions there, Myles. So the -- I think that most of the news has been recently around the Ford and how that pertains. There comes a point in time in these ships, where it becomes important for the Navy to begin to operate. I mean, if you think of the aircraft carrier is a city of 5,000 people with all of the functions that go on in the city, including its own airport, there comes a point in time where the city has to operate even if there are things that still need to be done. And so that's how you get to a delivery of the ship to let the Navy go operate it. In the course of that, there's stuff that comes up that we need to go back and work on.Our contract arrangements allow us to engage with that and pursue it. The normal track for the delivery of a ship is the ship will deliver, the Navy will go operate it for a while. It will come back to the shipyard for a post-shakedown availability. In the case of a lead ship, especially the case of the Ford, where you are developing. A lead ship is not -- it's not an incremental change in technology. It's usually 3 or 4 generations of change in technology. And so as you try to accommodate and develop those new technologies and move them into a production environment, you have to be agile and flexible on how you're going do balance that with the need for the Navy to operate the ship. So that's the way that we have proceeded across the whole range of technologies that we have out there. Some of that work will continue under the base construction contract. Some of that work, if it's complete, will be then covered in case of a warranty. And some of that becomes new scope and becomes a contract change. And it all just depends on the maturity of the technology and the item that we're talking about.
Christopher Kastner: Yes. I don't want to -- Myles, this is Chris. I wouldn't comment specifically on the frigate because it is competitive, but we generally don't see a material amount of post-delivery liabilities on the ships at delivery. There are obviously things that have to be worked off. We generally or always include those liabilities within the EACs and within our booking rates in our contracts.
Myles Walton: Great. That make sense. And Chris, maybe, while I have you, the cash flow walk into next year into 2020, I know, obviously, I'm not asking for cash flow guidance, but the CapEx that trends toward the 4% range into next year. And it sounds like the net effect of pension is effectively a neutral year-on-year. Are those 2 moving parts, right?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. No, thanks for that and thanks for not asking for guidance on 2020. But yes, the last high year related to capital is next year, and I'll give an update related to pension for 2020 as well because there was a pretty significant move there in our updated estimate. But you've got it about right. And we'll provide an update in all of those factors on our year-end call.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: Chris, just following up on that cash question, maybe I'll include the other year also. Is it still fair to think about 2019 being modestly above last year? Or is pension going to impact that? And can you just clarify in 2020 you said, 2020 is the high year on capital, so we should not expect CapEx release next year?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So still north in 2019 where we finished last year, which was $512 million. That being said, there is always plus or minus $50 million to $100 million related to working capital that can show up here in the last week. And what was the 2020 question, again?
Michael Petters: Capital.
Christopher Kastner: Capital, yes. So capital, it's $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion for the 5 years. So still a high level of capital in 2020. And then we get back down to the 2.5% of sales in 2021.
Jonathan Raviv: Okay. Got you. And then just as a follow-up, just your perspective on running pretty tight cash balances for the past few quarters, you have some big moves in the revolver. And now working capital can be a big swing item. What's being held out and when should we expect some releases? How much of this is Block V? And when we get that release, can we see some more aggressive repurchasing since repoised down year-on-year. All those shares are flat year-on-year, on maybe the carrier deal signed here. So just sort of overall question on cash balance and what it takes to really some of that?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So we're not overly concerned with our cash balance. We have adequate capacity within our commercial paper program. So we're really comfortable where we are from a cash standpoint. We have line of sight on all of the invoices that we're managing to get to year-end. So that's slightly north of last year we're pretty comfortable with. Of course, working capital can move it around a little bit. Relative to share buyback, we are actually comfortable with the commitment we made in '15 to return substantially all our free cash flow back to shareholders. We've increased our dividend at least 10% annually and executed the share buyback program that has us as over 120% return. So we're comfortable with that strategy. We're going to continue it, and we'll just move on from here.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.
Jeffrey Molinari: This is Jeff Molinari on for Gautam. So I'd like to adjust ask about Virginia-class performance. Can you talk a little bit about how you're performing versus schedule and cost? And kind of what challenges you've seen on the program or where are you kind of on the learning curve? Any color would be helpful.
Michael Petters: Yes. That's a good question. A lot of complexity in that question. Some of the challenges that have come up with Virginia-class was where we expanded the production rate from 1 submarine a year to 2 submarines a year. That required -- requires workforce enhancement and development. We fought through some challenges regarding sequester on the front-end of that program, which handicapped I think the program some. We had to -- you may recall, we had to go through some personnel reductions in Newport News before we had to start back into the program.We also were coming out of the block. It took a long time to negotiate the contract and we're probably a little slow to buy material, which -- that also affected the schedule. But what's happening in the program today, that's kind of a coming out of the block, the start a gun went off. And I'm not sure we were at sprint speed at the very beginning. But where we are today is, we're actually ramping right into that production rate. We're seeing tremendous learning in our teams. The teams are mature. We've invested in facilities to expand their capacity and we've reflected that as we've gone to negotiate the Block V contract. So I'm pretty comfortable with where we are on the submarine program today. We went through a little bit of a tough period there with all of those moving parts, but I think we're on -- that's behind us at this point. And now it's just a matter of going out and prosecuting the learning curves and continuing to prove on that every single day.
Jeffrey Molinari: That's very helpful to hear. One other quick follow-up, if you don't mind. Can you walk through to switching gears? Can you walk through some kind of key upcoming risk retirement milestones in Q4 and I guess, early 2020 ending on the horizon?
Michael Petters: Well, the previous milestones we provided in Q2 for 2019 are all on schedule. We expect those to happen over the balance of the year and we'll provide an update for 2020 on our year-end call.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: One for you, Chris. Was the contract adjustment in Newport News for the Los Angeles class, is that one time? Or is that part of the EACs? And roughly was the magnitude, maybe $20 million?
Christopher Kastner: I won't comment specifically. It wasn't material enough to comment on in the quarter, but it was Helena in Q3.
George Shapiro: No. But, I mean, you put in the race, so I figured it must be something substantial saying it partially offset the workers' comp benefited from last year.
Christopher Kastner: Well, it was enough to mention, but it wasn't enough to mention the value, George. We did adjust the EAC for it. And it'll -- on a going-forward basis, obviously the booking rate would be better on that program.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then for you, Mike. Just to follow-up on Block V. So the Navy is implying that they're only going to have the 9 ships rather than 11 or so. If you could just go through, I mean, it's cost, I assume evidently, and I know you talked about it a little bit earlier in the call, but I don't think you touched on it specifically?
Michael Petters: Well, we're still working our way through getting that contract. So I think I want to talk less about the specifics of that contract. We expect that to be done by the end of this year. And the shape of that contract I think will be a good balance for all of the folks that are interested and involved in it. I think that the most important thing from my standpoint is that the early on challenges in Block IV, we think are a really behind us, and we're moving ahead. And that sets up Block V very well for us.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: I just wanted to follow-up with a couple of carrier questions, guys. We'll start with Chris. Just on the risk retirement so you just alluded to. Can you just give us a sense of we fully reflect the risk on 79? When you float the ship here in the second half? There's all the potential EAC upside there happened in Q4 to some of that slip into next year? And then I have a follow-up for Mike.
Christopher Kastner: That's a good question, Rob. I think you're going to evaluate the risk every quarter, obviously. And as you get to launch, you're going to evaluate some risk. But they're going to -- they have a lot of risk in front of them. So there are risk retirement milestones on 79 in 2020 as well related to the test program. So, it's a Q4 issue and it's a next year issue.
Robert Spingarn: Is the majority Q4?
Christopher Kastner: I would say there is more risk in 2020 than in 2019.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then Mike on the 78 on the Ford, and with regard to shock trials, where do we stand on this? And if there is -- if it fails the shock trial, how do you frame the potential implications for the other Ford-class ships?
Michael Petters: Well, shock trial is still part of the cycle between where we are today and where the shape would go to its initial full-scale deployment. The question you've answered -- you've asked about what happens, there is a whole lot of data taken during the shock trial that has to be analyzed. It's almost you have to kind of say what kind of assumptions do you want to make. It's not really going to be a case of the ship passed or failed the shock trials. It's really going to be on a frame-by-frame, component-by-competent, how did the ship react to the shock and then is that okay, or is there something that we're going to be required to do to make it better. And that's part of the process. We've been through these before and there is a pretty well-understood process for getting the ship ready for the trial, executing the trial and then analyzing the data and recovering it from the trial and getting onto deployment. I would just point out that typically, the trial is not done on the lead ship, the trial is done on the second or third ship of the class to allow the maturity to go into place. So this is unique. But that's okay. We'll -- whatever path the Navy wants to go down, we're happy to be a partner with them and assist them along that path.
Robert Spingarn: But if you do have to do one on the lead ship, again, it sounds like you then might be making more changes than you normally would have to if you didn't on the second ship?
Michael Petters: I don't know how to handicap that quite frankly. The change over the change from the lead ship to the follow-on ships are not usually in the whole mechanical or electrical places and they're going to be more in the component system places. And so I don't know how to really kind of broad-brush that one.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic.
Peter Skibitski: Mike, there were some news in the trade press that there's, I think 6 carriers docked at Norfolk right now. I don't really know the reasoning behind it, but maybe you can give us a sense of the carrier maintenance work that could result from that and maybe the outlook for ship maintenance in general.
Michael Petters: Let me start with the second one first. The overall outlook for ship maintenance is that there's more maintenance to be done than there is really capacity right now in the system to do it. And so the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary, the CNO, the industry have been working hard to try to figure out how do you get more readiness per dollar because maintenance translates into readiness in terms of language.How do you get more maintenance? How do you get more readiness per dollar in the next period of time? And there's been some creativity brought to, maybe we contract a little bit differently, maybe we bundle contracts, maybe we do more planning, lots of those kinds of ideas that are being talked around at the working level that frankly, are coming from the secretary's push for, let's get this right. And to the Navy's credit, they've gone out and they've looked at other industries that have large fleets, and they've asked them how do they do it. So -- and we're deeply involved in that discussion with the Navy on how can we support that. Relative to the carriers, I think, the carriers are part of that discussion. And in a couple of those cases, we are assisting in helping get the Navy -- helping the Navy through this little bit of a crunch to get ships in a place where they can deploy. We're first ready to help them in any way we can.
Peter Skibitski: Okay. Just one quick follow-up on the CR. I guess, I think that tech services is kind of your short-cycle business and we're in November. Is tech services kind of feeling that CR at all right now in Q4? And how do you think about the impact overall to HII, if it goes into February or so?
Michael Petters: Yes. So we're not seeing anything yet. If it moves into Q2 next year, it could become an issue. But we're not seeing any impact as of yet.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: I wanted to ask about the 8% shipbuilding merger and guidance for 2019. If I do the math there, it looks like you're assuming relatively flat sequentially Q4 versus what you just put up in Q3. Can you just touch on that, it wouldn't seem like you've got more opportunity from a milestone perspective given kind of what came through in October and so what's out there to potentially do better than that.
Christopher Kastner: David, this is Chris. And we look at everything out there. 8% still makes a lot of sense to us. That being said, we'll assess all the milestones. We'll assess all the ACs in Q4 and adjust accordingly. But we're still comfortable with that 8%.
David Strauss: Okay. And Mike, did I hear on Montana, did that slip versus what you had said previously. I thought we are looking at 2020 on that, but I think on your prepared remarks, you said first half of 2021 now?
Michael Petters: Did I say that?
Christopher Kastner: Yes.
Michael Petters: Yes.
David Strauss: Okay. So it did slip?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. That's right. I mean, we got a pressure hull complete this quarter and then Mike indicated, it will slip.
David Strauss: Okay. And then the last one for me, I think this is fair since you talked about before Chris, you had said 2021 we could think about free cash flow pretty close to 100% conversion. Is that still a good place to think about, I guess, particularly now looking at what CAS is at least doing in 2020. I know, we're not talking about 2021 here, but just your prior comment on '21 free cash flow conversion.
Christopher Kastner: I think that's fair, David. I think that's a good way to think about it. All the factors that have been somewhat nonrecurring in nature or winding down here with capital and the net pension slowing down a little bit. And then becoming normalized a bit -- from -- and stabilizing working capital you would think that a 1.0 cash conversion is what we should achieve. That being said, at the end of the last year, $100 million to $150 million received in last week, which was great for everyone, but it was an expected benefit in '18 that we've been crawling out of in '19 over the last 3 quarters to achieve good cash here this year.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global.
Joshua Sullivan: What are the thoughts on the upcoming for the structure assessment at this point? Potentially looking at a little more distributed architecture, do you see opportunities there? Just what are some of the puts and takes you're thinking about?
Michael Petters: Well. There was a four structure assessment done four years ago that we could see the -- we could actually see ahead of that assessment. We could see that operating tempo of the Navy was higher than the structure that the Navy had to support it. And we anticipated that there would be some expansion. We're now at a place where there have been a lot of new ships put under contract. And I think that the opportunity now is, as we're building up this capacity in the industry, do we have the opportunity to kind of rethink through the -- we're can we create new future capability. And I know that maybe leadership has been thinking really hard about that. I think the Marine Core has been thinking really hard about that.We're engaged in those discussions, and we stand by to assist in any way that we can in ways that make sense. I think there is a very strong recognition in the Navy that you just can't go and make a hard left turn or a hard right turn because the Navy is so dependent upon its industry for its capacity. And I think Navy leadership has a very mature understanding of that. And so we think that the -- sitting here today with a record backlog of production for the next few years, it is the time for us to think about what's the next phase of shipbuilding look like? What are those ships going to look like? What are the amphibs going to look like? What are the carriers look like? And I think that's going to be a very positive discussion for the nation. And I think the industry, at least for HII's part, we stand ready to help go make that happen.
Joshua Sullivan: Got it. And then just with regards to some of the automation efforts, you're standing up at the Newport yard. Can just walk us through the milestones? And how we should see that benefit rolling in going forward?
Michael Petters: Well, we are using them now. This is not a role in implementation. We're using these product on CVN 80 now, and we're very pleased with how they're being utilized and the results that we're saying. That being said, there were -- we assume some of those savings in 80 and 81 contracts. So we're very pleased with how it's going. We look at how they're being developed and how they're being implemented on a very recurring basis. So we look forward to implementing a lot of 80, 81, and actually, on the Columbia-class as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Chris, just going back to the question previously on the implied fourth quarter shipbuilding margin being flat sequentially to get to the 8% for the year. Does that almost entirely reflect just still not knowing precisely when the 79 launch milestone occurs? Or does it more reflect that there's more risk relief cume catchup on that item staggered about the next several quarters then maybe our perception is of a big one on launch?
Christopher Kastner: I think that's a great question, Noah, and it's the latter, right? There is -- you absolutely retire risk in Q4 when you got to launch, but every shipbuilder knows that a lot of risk happens to the rest program. So I think you're a latter perception is probably the better one.
Noah Poponak: Okay. That makes sense. The only class services contract change item that you called out in the release, is it in the net 44 positive cume catcher? Or is it separate from that?
Christopher Kastner: It is. It's in.
Noah Poponak: It's in it?
Christopher Kastner: Yes.
Noah Poponak: And is it more than $10 million or less than $10 million?
Christopher Kastner: We don't give a specific number, Noah. I'm sorry.
Noah Poponak: Okay. I thought, I would try that anyway. On the cash flow statement, the projection or your statement that 2019 free cash flow grow year-over-year versus '18, is that true excluding that grant proceeds, just since those are up so much year-over-year?
Christopher Kastner: No. That's all in the calculation.
Noah Poponak: Is it not up excluding the grant proceeds?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. I don't want to get into the specifics on the cash flow statement on the call, but it's all in. Grant proceeds are in last year and in this year relative to the net free cash flow in '18 and '19.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And then lastly, there on the case flow statement, if you could maybe update on your -- how we see the working capital opportunity we've talked in the past about a lot of successes there over the last several years and just still -- we're still trying to hone in on how much is left. So maybe where you see that ending 2019? And what you can do with it in 2020?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. I think the 5% to 7% working capital percent of sales is a good place to be. And if we can achieve that going forward, I think, we'll be operating very well.
Noah Poponak: So I should think of that is more kind of stabilizing in terms of our year-over-year rate of change going forward?
Christopher Kastner: Correct. Yes, that's a great way to think about it. Of course, you have phases of programs that kick in from time-to-time, but I think the 5% to 7% is a good way to think about on a sustained basis going forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: Mike, I just wonder if you can get some perspective on TS inorganic appetite you'd, obviously, making some of those over the past few years. You still see an opportunity to build out some of the capabilities and/or customers and/or scale in that business, and if so, what kind of areas are you interested in, what size? And how do you see that impacting your growth profile and margin profile?
Michael Petters: Yes. There's a lot in that question. We planted a lot of seeds over in the TS area to see what sprouts. And right now, we're very, very pleased with the way that DOE business is moving ahead. Since we've -- since we separated the DOE business from shipbuilding, we have -- we've been on the team for winning 3 and we're prime contractor now for DOE, doing a prime at Los Alamos. So we think -- and we think that there is more opportunity there to take advantage for our environmental skills and our nuclear operation skills. And so that's a pretty important area to us.Our customer in the Navy is very interested in the unmanned space, particularly, I think the unmanned undersea space is a little bit more mature than the unbanned surface space. But in both of those cases, we see that, that's where our customer is going, that's our principal partnership for this business. And so we're trying to find the best way to support our customer on that. Make sure that we have the capabilities that we think are -- that the Navy is going to need for us to have going forward. And so we're -- we continue to work to strengthen that part of our business. We have always, for the -- at least for the last 20-some years, we've been supporting the fleet around the world. And as we've built some more capability there, we have also built some capability to support the Air Force and the Army. Whether it's in training or modeling and simulation or other kinds of operational things, we find that to be a really, really good business, and we continue to pursue those opportunities. And all of that, all -- every one of those areas has a need for capability in cyber and even intelligence. And we've built some capability within the last 12 months.We've enhanced our capability there. So we're always in a constant review of what are the capabilities we have, what are the capabilities that our customer's needs, is there a gap? And do we find the right way to pursue that gap. Scale is an interesting discussion because I don't think we want to pursue being big for the sake of being big. On the other hand, sometimes, local scale can actually be something that creates more flexibility for a particular customer. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And so we are pretty active in evaluating our gaps and evaluating opportunities to close those gaps and trying to be as creative as we can. We would also say that valuations are pretty high at this point. And so sometimes, the best thing for us to do is to let it go. And so we continue to have that as an option on our table. So we're not in a place where we're trying to acquire everything that moves. We're very deliberate and very disciplined about what we do and we believe that our approach continues to build great value in the company.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Petters for any further remarks.
Michael Petters: Well, I'd like to wrap things up by letting you know that we are in the process of finalizing the arrangements for an Investor Day meeting to share our views and outlook for the business. This event will be held in New York City and will include a reception on the evening of February 17 and our management presentation on February 18. So stay tuned for additional details in the coming months. Thanks again for joining us on today's call. We really appreciate your time and interest, and we look forward to seeing you soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2019 Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference Mr. Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Jimmy. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries' second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that are not historical facts, are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.Also in the remarks today, Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release.With that, I’ll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today’s call. So let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Slide three of the presentation. Sales of $2.2 billion for the quarter were 8% higher than 2018 and diluted EPS was $3.7. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $1 billion resulting in backlog of approximately $39 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $19 billion is funded. Regarding activities in Washington both the House and Senate recently passed their respective versions of the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization bill and they are now posture to begin conference. We are very encouraged by the strong support for Navy shipbuilding in both measures, which enables to continue procurement of destroyers, submarines, aircraft carriers and amphibious warships. Both bills also authorized and accelerate the purchase of LPD 31 in 2020 to best leverage the high production lines and supply chains for the LPD Flight II ships.Regarding the appropriations process, we’re very pleased that a bipartisan budget agreement for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, which raised the budget cash for defense and non-defense discretionary spending passed the House last week and we await final approval of the legislation and look forward to the Senate’s markup of respective appropriations bills after the August recess, followed as quickly as possible by conference on defense and other appropriations measures, so as to minimize the need for continuing resolution.We also encouraged that the administration analysis intention to proceed with refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 75, USS Harry S. Truman. And we look forward to having that ship arrive at our Newport News shipyard in the next decade.So now, I will provide a few points of interest on our business segments. At Ingalls, the team delivered NSC 8 Midgett in April and the ship sailed away in June. DDG 119 Delbert D. Black was relaunched after completing exterior structural repairs resulting from the incident that occurred during contractor delivery at the new floating drydock in March. The team is now focused on completion of interior damage repairs, as well as integration and testing activities. Delivery of the ship originally scheduled for the end of this year is still under review, but it’s likely to be in the first half of next year.LHA 7 Tripoli completed builder’s trials in mid-July. The team is now focused on acceptance trials later this year with delivery coming into focus in the late 2019 early 2020 timeframe. And finally, the team received the final Frigate RFP and is preparing its technical and pricing proposals for submission to the customer in accordance with their prescribed schedule.At Newport News, the team completed the upper bow section on CVN 79 Kennedy last month. This unit is the last superlift to be erected and completes the ship’s primary hull. Kennedy is approximately 94% structurally complete and approximately 62% complete overall. Outfitting and painting activities remain on track and do support launch planned for the fourth quarter of this year. CVN 73 USS George Washington achieved the 55% complete milestone during the second quarter and is on track with undocking plan this quarter. Following undocking, the team will be transitioning into the reinstallation and test phase of the RCOH. On the submarine program, SSN 791 Delaware remains on track with delivery also planned this quarter. SSN-794 Montana, our first Block IV delivery is on track to achieve pressure hull complete later this year with delivery planned for late next year. And finally the Block V contract award is expected later this year.For the Technical Solutions segment, results for the quarter were impacted by a $12 million forward loss on a fixed price maintenance availability at our San Diego shipyard for the cruiser CG 65 USS Chosin. The loss was primarily due to unanticipated additional cost required to complete aluminum repair work in the superstructure and topside area of the ship. This issue was discovered during our quarterly EAC process and that process also revealed that the team was not making the operational progress consistent with the remaining work scope on the ship. So we send some of our most experienced shipbuilders to review the situation and we discovered a deficit in the capabilities to manage and execute the work.As a result of our review, we recognize the forward loss and we are restructuring and adding talent to the program and execution teams in order to ensure that the work is performed, with the highest quality and that the ship is returned to the fleet as soon as possible.The Technical Solutions team continues to move forward and achieve success on its key growth initiatives across several business fronts. In unmanned systems, for example, we continue to support Boeing as their teaming partner on construction of the first five XLUUVs, a program which we believe will dramatically change the market for unmanned undersea vehicles. Our G2 and Fulcrum acquisitions have been operationally integrated and we are already starting to see benefits from adding these new capabilities to our existing businesses. In fact, we have already begun developing and submitting proposals as an integrated entity, which we believe will translate into additional growth opportunities going forward. And in our Nuclear Services division, our Department of Energy business continues to perform very well and we remain actively engaged on several large new business pursuits in this space.In summary, our programs continue to be well supported as authorization and appropriations bills work their way through Congress. Award of the VCS Block V contract later this year will further expand our backlog and help insulate the business from any future debate in Washington around defense spending levels. At Ingalls and Newport News, we are poised to achieve several key milestones in the second half of the year. We set the foundation for return to 9% to 10% shipbuilding margins in 2020. And the Technical Solutions team is focused on capturing growth initiatives across their business portfolio and achieving margins of 5% to 7% in 2020. I am confident that our team will accomplish these objectives and continue producing long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.So now, I will turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Mike and good morning. As I review our second quarter financial results, you may follow along with the slide presentation we posted this morning on our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide four of the presentation. Our second quarter revenues of $2.2 billion increased 8.3% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to growth in our Technical Solutions division due to the acquisitions of G2 and Fulcrum and higher volumes in aircraft carriers and navy nuclear support services at Newport News.Operating income in the quarter of $175 million decreased $82 million or 31.9% from second quarter 2018 and operating margin of 8% decreased 472 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by an unfavorable change in the operating FAS/CAS adjustment, compared to the prior year. Performance of Newport News on the VCS program and the recognition of a forward loss on a contracted at Technical Solutions.Turning to Slide five of the presentation. Cash used in operations was $44 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $91 million or 4.2% of revenues, compared to cash provided by operations of $239 million and $85 million of net capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2018. During the quarter, we contributed $14 million to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans, of which $4 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified plans. We also repurchased approximately 246,000 shares at a cost of $52 million and paid dividends of $0.86 per share or $36 million, bringing our quarter end cash balance to $29 million.At quarter end, we had drawn $414 million on our revolving credit facility. The lower cash generation in the quarter was simply a function of timing with some received delayed into early third quarter. As we look forward for the full year, we expect free cash flow to be just north of last year’s free cash flow of $512 million.Moving on to Slide six of the presentation. Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $622 million decreased $7 million from the same period last year. Ingalls operating income was $69 million and margin of 11.1% in the quarter were down from second quarter 2018, mainly due to lower risk retirement on the LPD program, as well as recoveries related to a settlement agreement in 2018.Turning to Slide seven of the presentation. Newport News revenues of $1.3 billion in the quarter increased 7.1% from the same period last year, mostly due to higher volumes in aircraft carrier construction, aircraft carrier RCOH programs and Navy nuclear support services. Newport News operating income of $70 million and margin of 5.5% in the quarter were down year-over-year primarily due to lower performance on the VCS program and pending contract actions for Block V boats.Now to Technical Solutions on Slide eight of the presentation. Technical Solutions revenues of $336 million in the quarter increased 38.3% from the same period last year, mainly due to the acquisitions of G2 and Fulcrum, which collectively contributed $66 million of revenue in the quarter, as well as growth in oil and gas, fleet support and nuclear and environmental services. Technical Solutions operating loss of $1 million in the quarter, compares to operating income of $7 million in the second quarter of 2018. The decline is primarily a result of the forward loss related to the fleet support contract that Mike discussed earlier.Lastly, let me provide some thoughts on how the year is developing. With our strong start to the year for revenue, we expect year-over-year shipbuilding revenue growth of approximately 5% in 2019 and expect Technical Solutions revenue between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. Also, we expect our shipbuilding business to achieve approximately 8% return on sales for the full year. In this regard, we expect shipbuilding margin will improve sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of 2019, as we ramp to margins of 9% to 10% in 2020.As outlined on Slide 9, the shipbuilding margin ramp-up will be supported by the achievement of key program milestones later this year with significant risk retirement weighted towards the fourth quarter. For Technical Solutions, we continue to expect margins between 5% and 7% in 2020. Finally for 2019, we now expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $220 million, which now includes the recent Technical Solutions acquisitions and we expect interest expense to be approximately $65 million.That concludes my remarks. I’ll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourselves to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Jimmy, I’ll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is now open.
Myles Walton: Hi, good morning. Mike, I was going to lead off with – now that the budget deal looks like it’s going to take place and clusteration is going to be race from the vernacular. Can we take a – are you ready to take a more constructive view on the growth trajectory of the shipbuilding business at this point?And I know, Chris you said in the remarks, you actually gave the sales guidance for the year, which again is obviously above that 3%, you guys have been talking about. So Mike, where are you in your heads at from a growth perspective, given now that the budget outlook seems deforming more positively?
Mike Petters: Well, I guess, number one, we’re very, very happy that this deal has come together. We’re hopeful that Senate will take it up and it will become the framework for an appropriations process and we can minimize the impact of any C.R. As far as the shipbuilding Myles, I mean the growth is really based on the way the work flows through the business. We’re sitting here today with a $39 billion backlog. We have a Block V out there. There is a frigate competition going on. The way that all of that volume of work is going to flow through the business is still – it’s going to give us a 3% CAGAR through the next three to five years.Wherever the budget process goes that’s where that’s going to end up, I think so there may be a year or quarter, where it’s a little bit higher or lower than that, but I think that it’s – the main thing about it is that we’re locking the contracts in, and so if there is a right turn in the budget process and after 2021 then we’ve already got our work under contract. So that’s for us is the way, we’re thinking about the business and I’m not really going to change the growth rate based on the budget deal.
Myles Walton: So just to clarify the last couple of years of 11% and now 5% obviously, above that 3% growth rate, I mean you’re expecting a pretty sharp deceleration implied?
Chris Kastner: Well, yeah, obviously with the growth over the first, this is Chris, over the first half of the year and what we look at the second half getting to a 5% growth for the year, there could be a deceleration going forward. I think that 3% is a pretty good baseline to use. Going forward, that being said, as Mike indicated with the budget deal and with the backlog in Block V hopefully get negotiated in the second half of the year. We will be going to our planning process, and if we think it’s north of that, then we could update that at the end of the year, but I think the 5% this year and then using 3% beyond that’s probably a pretty good baseline to set at this point.
Myles Walton: All right. Got it. I’ll leave it there. Thanks.
Mike Petters: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Carter Copeland: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning, Carter.
Carter Copeland: Mike. I wondered if I could just ask a kind of overarching question about execution. Just given the importance that execution is going to have on the next couple of years, margin targets or expectations that you laid out. When you just look at the some of the lower performance you called out on VCS or some of the stuff that’s in the public domain on delays there and then the performance?And in TS, in the quarter, I just wonder if you take a step back and look at where you guys have come in terms of performance, if this is kind of a couple of one-offs before you hit your groove again or should we be – is there something systematic in some of the challenges you’ve had albeit that small – we should be mindful of? Thanks.
Mike Petters: Carter, that’s a great question. And actually something that we’re spending some time on here. The activity of the past couple of, first of all, let’s step back historically, in my career in the shipbuilding business, we’re executing today at a level that is as high or higher than I’ve seen in my career across the business. Having said that, you’re exactly right, we have had a couple of hiccups along the way that really have been concerning to us. And as a result, we’re at a place today where we now have been able to go and because of the execution, we’ve been able to go and capture the largest backlog, we’ve ever had. The task in front of us now is to go and execute that better than we ever have done before.To that end, I’ve asked our business leaders to take another turn on execution and risk management in their business to make to ensure us and by that extension you, that we’re going to execute that backlog as well as it can be executed. And so I actually think that this is one of the greatest value opportunities for us because we have this backlog and we have an opportunity now that we have the visibility in the horizon in front of us. We actually now have the opportunity to go execute this in even more robust way than maybe we’ve seen in the past.So the first piece of business is eliminating these little refinements and hiccups that we’ve had along the way. And so that’s why the issue that we had this quarter in San Diego that’s just another indication of what you’re talking about and where we need to tighten up our performance. But I’m confident that the team will turn to that and set some records going forward.
Carter Copeland: Is there – just as a quick follow-up to that, is there any commonality in the hiccup or they each idiosyncratic?
Mike Petters: Yes, I think each one stands on its own. I think the challenge that we’ve given ourselves is that usually these things are not new. The root cause of any particular hiccup is something that we’ve seen in the business before. So one of the things we have to do is take the places where we’re executing excellently and make sure that’s the standard for the whole business and that’s where a lot of our energy is going to be.
Carter Copeland: Okay. Thanks for the color, Mike.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Doug Harned: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Doug Harned: Mike, when you talked about the budget, one the things that’s also happened in parallel, as we’ve got a new Marine. And he’s talked about a very different, I would say in his planning guidance sort of a very different structure for the emphasis force. Potentially moving away from LHAs, LPDs, LSDs and then so forth. Could you talk about your thoughts around that and where you see the evolution of the Navy going and shifts like that, I mean these things obviously take quite a while, but is there something you need to think about now, or is this something that’s really far off in the future?
Mike Petters: Well, thanks. I guess a question we ask ourselves everyday, the world is changing, the Navy is changing in response to that and we are changing in response to the Navy. I just would point to the effort that we are putting into the unmanned space right now in support of really – primarily in support UUVs, but overall we think that the unmanned space is going to fundamentally change the Navy going forward.The intent to try to make ships more lethal from the Navy standpoint is something that we’re paying close attention to. We’re engaged with the Navy now to think about what’s the next version of the Ford-class look like, this two ship contract that we have is a great contract, but if you don’t spend time thinking about what that ship should evolve to today when it comes time to go to a new contract, you’ll be late. It will be too late to think about it then.And the same sort of thing happens with and the Marines as they rethink their way of how they plan to engage on the nation’s behalf. We plan to be right there with them and support of what they need to do. You’re right, these are not light switch changes. It’s not a course change where you’re going to go hard left or hard right turn, these things have to kind of, they have to evolve from an operational concept perspective, and then from a technology and platform perspective, and then all the way down to a training and recruiting perspective. But I think the commandant has kind of laid it out there and said, look that over the horizon the way we’ve always done business may not be the way that we need to do business in the future. And I think that’s true for everybody and we are very actively engaged in trying to support that.
Doug Harned: Just as a follow-on in the in the priorities that the Navy has looked at, I mean readiness is, obviously been a big ones. So on the shorter end here, I mean you’ve benefited from a lot of the work you’ve been doing on the Los Angeles-class ships, which has helped revenue. When you look forward, I mean this is a short cycle part of the business. So it is an area that could give you some upside from that, I would think from that 3%, depending how it plays out. And how do you see the outlook for fleet support here and repair work going forward, given this focus on readiness? Is this an episodic event with the Los Angeles-class work or is this something we could – you expect to see continue to build?
Mike Petters: Well, you’re right that it’s a short cycle business and the visibility that we have in that businesses, significantly limited compared to what we have in the construction business. There is no doubt that the Navy today is rethinking its overall approach to readiness and how do they get more readiness for the dollar.They’re looking at ways to be more efficient, I mean, I would point back to San Diego again, not to keep bringing that up but, that was a contract change type on the government’s part to move to a fixed price contract and our team was a little slow to respond to that. And so as they’re pursuing efficiency and the readiness space, we have to be agile enough to respond to it.The history of that space though, Doug, as you probably know is that there is a lot of variability in it and most of it gets pushed out to the private sector. So the government yards and the government activities there are a primary source of providing that readiness and when there is overflow or where there’s dynamics that go beyond that capacity it moves to the private sector, which means that the private sector fluctuates a lot more than readiness budgets in general. I know that that’s something that the Navy is trying to address and fix and they believe that addressing that issue, creating some more predictability in the private sector would then create opportunities for more efficiency. We support that, we are not through that process, I mean I think that we’re in the middle of that to try to see how that plays out.As a result, we’ve got some good submarine repair work that we’ve been doing at Newport News, but we don’t have great visibility into what’s out there and how that’s going to play out. And to the extent if that gets sorted out, it will become more predictable and we can make it a more predictable part of our business space.
Doug Harned: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Mike, I wanted to ask you about the timing on some of these deliveries. So you talked about DDG 119. I think previously or you showed that you’ve move that into 2020, but also LHA 7, the Tripoli, that’s now late in the year or early next year. I wanted to ask you, what’s going on with that ship. Why is it being pushed to the right? And then, to what extent they pushed out ships into 2020 get you to your margin expectation of 9% to 10%, meaning is that a sustainable margin from 2020 on, or does it benefit from a high cluster of risk retirements from deliveries?
Mike Petters: Well. So first question around LHA 7, we had a very successful Builders trials on LHA 7 and the ship is in is in really good shape. Where we are is, we’re working through a couple of technical design issues that we’re working and discussing with the Navy about, are these life of the ship issues that need to be resolved before we deliver the ship, or are there issues is that we resolved, we deliver the ship and because the systems are working today is just a question of whether they will work for the life of the ship.So we’re in that sort of discussion with the Navy. They’re fairly complicated and – but we think that will come to a resolution around the end of the year and predicting whether it’s – the end of this year or the beginning of next year is, we don’t want to put any sort of extra pressure on that. We want to resolve that the right way.Relative to your second question about things moving into 2019, I mean we’ve got actually pretty significant work in 2019 before we go to 2020. The delivery of Delaware, the launch of 73. The launch of 79 in the fourth quarter is on track and that’s a big event for us. And in fact, we’re beginning the process of planning the christening ceremony before the end of the year. So that, we feel very positive about that. As we move into 2020, however, things shake out at the end of the year with LHA 7. What happens in 2020, as we get back, we start to get back to that normal blend that we’ve always talked about that’s pretty healthy.We will now have a really large backlog of new work, but we will have work now moved into the mature level where we believe we can sustain 9% to 10% range that we think is healthy for the business. We do have four deliveries at Ingalls next year, including the Fitzgerald. But I think that’s going to become a persistent drive across the business going forward.So I don’t think that we are moving things into 2020 to make 2020 feel better. The things that move into 2020 or not going to make 2020 feel better at the expense of 2021. I think we’re in a pretty good place to have a pretty sustained run in the healthy range of this business given that the work is under contract.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Well, that’s very helpful and I wasn’t really suggesting that you’re doing it deliberately, but just maybe the timing got you there. And then I also wanted to thank you all for the extra color you provided here particularly these milestones. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Thanks. And we’re not obviously ships go when they need to go and if we can get seven done this year we will, but we will – it’s going to be done the right way. Whatever we work with the Navy, it will be ready to go and it will be done the right way and everybody can be confident that’s going to happen, but that doesn’t impact the range that we’ve been talking about. We’re confident of the 9% to 10% range. We’re confident of that given that we have the backlog and we have the teams in place to go execute it.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Raviv from Citi. Your line is now open.
John Raviv: Thank you and good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
John Raviv: On cash flow, kind of a just double partner here. And so first of all, what drives the second half pick up after pretty weak one half. And then also, where is the shortfall of this year, it seems like the 2019 message or target, if you will continue to ratchet down? You said only modest free cash flow growth that’s a limited operating growth that you assume capex is up this year. So where is that weakness confidence coming from and do we pick it up next year?
Mike Petters: Yes. Thanks for that.
Chris Kastner: John, it’s really simply timing. Unfortunately, we had some invoices slip into Q3. Probably the largest example is, we had a $84 million delivery invoice from NSC 8 that moved from Q2 to Q3. So, it’s simply timing, obviously the back half of the year, it will be much stronger. We had some contract modes that are waiting on specifically at Newport News. So it’s unfortunate the first half of the year started as it did, but it’s simply timing. I fully expect us to recover over the back half of the year.
John Raviv: But can you just – Chris, can you speak more to about the 2019 target. I mean, having basically flat free cash flow year-over-year, that’s what I assume with pension tailwind this year, is a bit down. I mean, just given so bigger picture question is really – given huge backlog the budget deal in place, I think there’s a lot of moving pieces. But can you give a sense of the organic capital generation opportunity in this business going forward with and without pension, with and without working capital flow, just a level of setups, just because of 2019 numbers continue to melt down over the last six month to 18 month?
Chris Kastner: I think it’s a pretty good question, John. We did have this excellent Q4 2018, where working capital was at really the lowest level, I think we’ve ever been at. So that’s impacting it a bit. I don’t think you get back to a normalized free cash flow until 2021, when our capital program is complete and pension normalizes and we get back to mid 100% free cash flow conversion. So I think 2021 is really kind of the best place to look when we get to a more normalized level of cash flow.
John Raviv: All right. Thanks.
Mike Petters: I do, I think it’s fair to say that the excellent cash we had in Q4 created a bit of a headwind for 2019 and we’ve been talking about that through the year.
John Raviv: Thanks, Mike. I’ll hop back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Gautam Khanna: Thanks, guys. Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Gautam Khanna: Two questions. First, I was wondering on the elision that happened, did that have any knock on productivity drag in the quarter or will it, as we move forward as you move teams to assess the damage? Just wondering what the knock on effect was in Q2, if it was, and if not? Mike, there would one on the comp?
Chris Kastner: Yes. So we have insurance to protect us against that there is an immaterial deductible that we have to deal with related to insurance, but we have insurance to protect that Gautam.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. So there is no impact in terms of a cume catch up or anything of that insurance?
Chris Kastner: Other than the deductible now.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And then could you actually give us what the cume -- the profit adjustments were? How they skewed by segment?
Chris Kastner: Sure. So the growth favorable were $63 million, 40% of those were Newport News and 60% Ingalls. The unfavorable was $44 million, 50% Newport News, 30% TS and 20% Ingalls.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And just related to an earlier question about, once you get behind on the VCS program or any program. Just curious about the curve to catch up. I mean the word obviously is once we fall behind or stay behind. Just curious about your confidence on recovering and if you could just give us any color as to what gives you confident?
Chris Kastner: Yes. I mean, especially when you’re a in a serial production line like we are with the Virginia-class. If you start to have issues with schedule it does start to affect the synchronization of the line. We’ve been working pretty hard to reset that this year, given kind of where we started last year fourth quarter and we made great progress on that. This is really a Block IV issue that we’re working through to get units out of our steel fab facility and into the production.We’ve created – we’ve taken advantage of space. We’ve created some new construction sites for our teams to go work on. We’ve changed the leadership team to be more engaged in the process of taking advantage of the tools that we have. The digital tools that we have to drive productivity. And we’ve seen that, again, not a light switch kind of thing where you say you wake up one day and say everything is fixed, but we are making good progress to getting back towards the schedule that we need to have. And we’re and we’re pretty optimistic about that.Beyond that, it informs the way that we set the schedule for Block V. And so, as we are coming to get to that contract under our belt that will be factored into the Block V. So all in all, I’m optimistic about the progress that we’ve made. We still got work to do, but the team is – we got the right team in place and they’re doing the right things and we’re making the right kind of progress.
Gautam Khanna: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Ronald Epstein: Yes. Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Ronald Epstein: Maybe just one big picture question. When you’re thinking about capital deployment now, how are you thinking about stuff like M&A, is there any adjacencies out there, bolt-ons that sort of thing? Are you just focused on returning capital to shareholders?
Ronald Epstein: Well, we’ve – our strategy Ron for the last three or four or five years, we’ve been talking about is that we want to invest in our core business with capital projects and we’re coming towards the end of that. We’re going to return substantially all of our free cash flow to our shareholders, but we’re going to invest in ways to grow our services business. And you’ve seen us do that with some acquisitions. If you look at our Technical Solutions division today and you look at the businesses that we’re in, I really like those businesses. I think there is opportunities in the unmanned space for further expansion.I think that the DOE business in the last five years we’ve become a department of energy prime contractor and there is a significant amount of work in that space. And so how that plays, and where it goes? Those are two critical areas for us to be prosecuting. The opportunity to do – expand our footprint in cyber and Intel is always out there, as we think about where those customers are and what capabilities they need. And so we are opportunistic on this, and if we see the right opportunity, we’re going to engage and we have engaged and I expect that will continue.
Ronald Epstein: Okay. And then maybe can you give us a quick update where we stand on Virginia-class, because in the quarter, it seem like you took a charge or something there?
Chris Kastner: Ron, let me add on the Virginia-class, the language in the script and then in the earnings release. The vast majority of the reduction from last year is related to the reduced booking rate in the Q4 charge that we took. So there was fine tuning in the EACs as we always do quarter-over-quarter, but nothing, nothing material that we can mention, most of that was just the reduction in the base level booking rate on the program.
Ronald Epstein: Okay, but nothing new?
Mike Petters: No.
Chris Kastner: Again, as I said before, the team on the Virginia-class program right now is making some really good progress to get Block IV set up for success.
Ronald Epstein: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much. Good morning. Definitely appreciate that it’s too early in the year to be making predictions about pension for next year or anything like that, but I guess just to give us a sense of what the sensitivities are around for the P&L, FAS/CAS and on the cash flow statement. If the year ended today, I assume you had some good asset performance which helps and then interest rates, which are negative and so how does all that shake out?
Mike Petters: Yeah. So, Seth, thanks for that question. It took a while, before I got to a pension question, but asset returns – as you would expect and as you indicated asset returns are up over 14% through the end of Q2 and discount rate down about 70 basis points. So those are opposing forces in the calculation, unfortunately you calculate FAS/CAS and cash differently. So it’s tough to get to a real answer. I think, you’re right, it’s early in the year to do that calculation and forecast into 2020 and 2021.So I think it makes sense to wait a bit. The sensitivities are in the K, in the year-end K. So you can find them there, and try to estimate it. From a cash standpoint, CAS and cash tend to move together, so that should help out a bit when you think about it. But you’re right, it is early in the year and I indicated what the asset performance was and what the discount rate performance was, so that should help you out a bit.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thanks. And maybe just to follow up on John’s question from earlier. When we think about the cash flow outlook for the business, working capital came down considerably for a number of years. We saw a very good working capital performance as a percentage of sales, where should we think about where, just – we’ve got to make an assumption and so, on a go forward basis – can working capital be 6% of sales consistently for this business, is it more of a high single-digit number? Just in terms of thinking about where cash flow can go in the out years?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. I think that 6% performance was outstanding performance and then something closer to 8% or 9% makes a lot more sense on a run rate basis on where we tend to fall out. Remember, over the last few years we did have restructuring in the working capital, so it should definitely come down from there, but at the end of last year was kind of an outlier.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Hi, guys. Good morning. One for you, Chris and then one for Mike. One for you is probably a simple one. The implication of the 5% revenue growth for the year is a little under 3% in the back half, is that primarily going to be at Newport News or Ingalls or how should we look at? How it splits between the two businesses?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, I think it’s primarily Newport News.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then for you, Mike. In general, over the last number of years, you’ve had an impeccable record of executing in a business that’s notoriously been pretty risky. And now all of a sudden, we started to see some issues crop up. What do you think has changed from those years of terrific execution, so what we’re seeing now and admittedly you would forecast, but some of this occur, but I just wanted your thoughts on that?
Mike Petters: Yeah. Thanks, George. I mean we are putting a lot of energy into this right now, because as I said before, we are – we believe and my experience is that we’re executing at a very high level, but we are fraying on the edges, and it’s time now to go and take another turn to clean that up. And so we’ve got some new people, we got some new leadership. We are getting into executing new work. It’s not lead ship kind of work, but for instance, we had a contract type change in San Diego that we didn’t react too fast enough.Across the business today, we have pockets of superior execution. The challenge that I put in front of the team is that needs to be the standard and not just the pockets that we have. And so the team has taken a turn on how do we go and do that, and as I look across the business today, I see – I already see some evidence that, that’s going to benefit us in the future. We talked a little bit about Block IV, today. I see the things happening in Block IV to rectify and get that set up that piece of that program for success. Clearly, the launch of 79 before the end of the year. If we go back a couple of years, we were talking about a launch of 79 in the spring of 2020.We’re at a place now, where we’re going to be launching that ship here at the end of 2019 and it’s going to be the heaviest ship we have ever launched, which is an indication of how well they’ve outfitted the ship, how well the pre-outfitting has gone and how well the program management team is running. So in the main, we are executing well, but we’ve got, – you’re right, we’ve got a couple of little clean up areas. So we got to go pay attention to, and we need to make this superior execution, where we have it, we need to make that our standard and that’s the task it’s in front of us and we’re ready to go get it.
George Shapiro: But I guess what’s caused that to change because for number of years, you must have always had some potential issues, but they didn’t seem to surface themselves till now?
Mike Petters: It’s almost on a case-by-case basis, but if I were to step back and say, what’s the kind of the macro thing is. As our programs have expanded, we’ve had new people put into places of leadership and we haven’t supportive them very well. And whereas – if you go back six, seven, eight years ago, we may have had some pretty senior leaders in places that they knew all the ins and outs of the business. And so that’s the challenge is. How do we take someone who is going to be walking into a program for the first time and make sure that they have a structure of support for success around them that will set the standard for where we’re going. And I don’t think that we will been as tight on that over the last couple of years, as we should have been, but that’s certainly something that we can put our arms around and fix in pretty short order.
George Shapiro: Thanks very much. Very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Strauss: Thanks. The free cash flow guidance or help you gave us implies, obviously a lot of cash coming in the second half of the year. Chris, what do you plan to do with that? Would you delever some from having levered up in the first half of the year or should we expect most of that going towards a step up buyback?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So we’ll stay with our commitment to return substantially all of our free cash flow through 2020 back to shareholders, I do expect that it will be out of the revolver so some deleverage make sense, but our commitment to return substantially are free cash flow to shareholders remains. We think it’s a good strategy. We’re going to keep to it.
David Strauss: Okay. And then Mike just going back to this ramp to 9% to 10% shipbuilding margins in 2020. Are there specific programs or milestones that are really stand out here and being able to achieve that then we can monitor or watch for?
Mike Petters: Yeah. I think the milestones that we’ve laid out already are the ones to pay attention to obviously, getting 79 launch this year is a big deal for us. And then getting Delaware out and getting the VCS program back on track for next year is also going to be pretty important. The 119 while we’ve talked about the financial impact in the insurance of 119, the resetting of the production line in the destroyers were that we had obviously hadn’t planned for the rework we’ve had to do there.Getting that back into sequence and getting that back in the face, so the purpose of the destroyer line doesn’t get impacted by that, is the work that Ingalls is on right now that will set us up for success in 2020. So I think the milestones that you have in front of us. The things that we need to get done here between now and the end of the year set us up very well for next year.
David Strauss: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.
Josh Sullivan: Hi. Good morning. Question relating to the execution threat and then you touched on it, but these technology efficiency initiatives you’re working on, shipbuilding would appear to be an area that could benefit. Can you detail any early success with these initiatives or maybe how any pilot programs are progressing?
Mike Petters: We have lots of pilot programs going on across the business, and I’m a little reluctant to put any sort of particular number there because any number you put in it you extrapolate across the volume of the business and it becomes eye watering. But we are very excited about the ability to bring digital technology, digital work instructions, visual build tools to a workforce that is younger than we’ve had in a while that is used to working with these kinds of tools, who are empowered to talk about how they think things could go better and a leadership team that is engaged and looking for ways to do things better.And we are seeing improvements in both cost and schedule in the pilots and we’re seeing that in both yards. And so we are – we’ve made significant capital investment over the last five years that we talked about that in a generational improvement. The fact of the matter is we’re seeing benefits from those capital investments today in terms of efficiencies. And that’s – all of that goes into given us the confidence that the business is going to accelerate into the normal range of where the business should be by next year. So that’s kind of – I think that’s about all I would really want to say about it. We have a fairly young workforce at Newport News today.And I remember the days 10 years ago when we had some tough contracts, but a very young workforce at Ingalls. And in three years, Ingalls workforce went from being the youngest in the industry after Katrina caused a major change in disruption at workforce. Three years later, they were still the youngest in the industry, but they were the most experienced because they deliver 10 ships. I think that sort of success is sitting in front of Newport News today in terms of – they’ve got work under contract, they’ve got a young leadership team, they’ve got a young workforce and they are engaging in very constructive and productive ways and it just creates excitement every time I walk through the yard.
Josh Sullivan: Appreciate that. And then just switching gears, is there any update on the Columbia program progress. What are the major gating factors of the program. Is there anything in the supply chain or design side that remains a hurdle at this point?
Mike Petters: Yeah. For our work – our work is on track. We’re supporting General Dynamics in that program. Our capital projects that we put in place to support that and create the efficiencies that we need to capture are on track and we’re already, we’re actually using some of those facilities for work in the Virginia-class program and we’re capturing efficiencies there. So from our standpoint, the program is essentially on track. We’re getting to the point where it’s going to be gets – where lead ships get really interesting. Can the design stay in front of the construction, I think we got a really good schedule. I think our partners at Electric Boat have got a really good schedule and really good leg up on that, but it’s time to go perform.
Josh Sullivan: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from a follow up from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert Spingarn: Yeah. Thanks for taking this follow-up. I was just wondering, are the public Navy yards able to service the Ford-class carriers. I was reading somewhere that they weren’t outfitted to be able to accommodate this class. I just wasn’t sure, if that was the case and if this might present different sustainment opportunity versus the Nimitz?
Mike Petters: I think it’s a good question, Rob, there are clearly differences between Ford and Nimitz the power requirements, those kinds of things, but I think those are all things that can be addressed, and will be addressed by the government shipyards. And so I don’t really see a major fundamental change in the way that the Ford-class is going to be supported from the industry. It’s a little bit early on that, but we’re – I know that everybody knows what you have to do to get a shipyard ready to receive the Ford. Remember the haul is the same, and so those physical things like peers and docks, those kinds of things don’t need to change much but some of that some of the support things we’ll just have to be upgraded and that’s just a matter of doing it and they will be able to do it.
Robert Spingarn: Just on this topic have you seen this opportunity anywhere else across the fleet, whether we’re talking about surface ships or submarines?
Mike Petters: In terms of trying to expand the –
Robert Spingarn: The service opportunities in other words, yeah, where maybe the Navy itself is changing the scope of what it does, which creates opportunity for you and your peers?
Mike Petters: Well, I think I’ve said before, the Navy has taken a hard turn on, how do you do readiness in a more efficient way, and that’s being led from the secretary’s office. I mean it is really, we’ve talked about readiness in my career for a long time. This is a no kidding effort to go get it sorted out. And they’ve had some success in the aviation community that they’re looking to translate into the ship repair business. My perspective on it and I think that they’re working hard to try to figure this out, is that the history is, that a lot of variability in that space has been pushed to the private sector. And they’re looking to try to create more predictability there.Predictability from a standpoint of scope, predictability from a standpoint of price performance and contract type and considering bundling contracts and things like that, all of those are good ideas and all of those things need to play out. And I think we’re on the front end of that to see whether we can actually create more efficiency there. We certainly want to participate in that and so far, we’ve kind of got our toe in the water with the Virginia-class support. And we’ll see what other opportunities it presents. So little early for us to try to predict how that’s all going to shake out.
Robert Spingarn: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Noah Poponak: Hey. Good morning, everyone. I wondered if a month into the third quarter, you had a sense for how the net cumulative catch-ups at Ingalls were shaping up for 3Q, even if just kind of broad strokes directionally versus more like 1Q or more like 2Q? And then my second question is on the working capital on the cash flow statement topic. Could you just tell us what you’re assuming either back half or full year for change in working capital in your statement of where you expect the cash flows to shake out for the year?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So, thanks. No, I absolutely think the risk retirement events are more tailored towards Q4. So I won’t give Ingalls or Newport News separately. It’s absolutely position to sequentially get better, Q2, Q3 and Q4, such that Q4 will be better. For the working capital standpoint, we don’t have a specific target. I guess you could probably do the math, relative to the just north of where we finished last year, but that’s where we are thinking will end up at this point.
Noah Poponak: All right. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions in the queue at this time, I’d like to turn the call back to Mike Petters, CEO for any closing remarks.
Mike Petters: Well, I just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. As you can see across the business things are, we’re executing pretty well and we have the opportunity to execute somewhat even better and milestones for the rest of the year and shipbuilding set us up very well for where the shipbuilding business needs to be next year, and our Technical Solutions division is performing, all of those Technical Solutions division is performing well across the board and those are businesses that we really value and like to be in. So thanks for being with us. And we look forward to see your around the street.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today’s conference. This does conclude your program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2019 Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Dwayne, you may begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Nova. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in their remarks today, Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. So let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.1 billion for the quarter were 11% higher than 2018, and diluted EPS was $2.85. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $20 billion, including the historic $15.2 billion contract for the construction of CVN 80 and CVN 81. And as a result, the backlog was approximately $41 billion at the end of the quarter, the highest level since becoming a public company in 2011 of which $20 billion of that is funded. Now turning to Washington for a moment. We were pleased that the President's budget request strongly supported shipbuilding again this year by continuing investment in submarines, destroyers, aircraft carriers and amphibious warships. We were particularly pleased by the proposed increases in production rates for selected programs as well as continued investment for the Refueling and Complex Overhaul of CVN 74 USS John C. Stennis, which we expect to arrive at our Newport News shipyard in 2021. Now similar to previous budget cycles, we will continue to advocate for acceleration of amphibious warship production to enhance affordability by better leveraging our hot production lines and supply chain. We look forward to working with the Congress and our customers during this budget cycle and stand ready to build the Navy our nation needs. Now I'll provide a few points of interest on our business segments. At Ingalls, the team delivered DDG-117 Paul Ignatius and completed acceptance trials on NSC-8 Midgett. Now note that the work on Midgett has also been completed, and the ship was delivered to the Coast Guard just yesterday. For LHA-7 Tripoli, the focus continues on integration and testing to support planned trials and delivery this fall. And finally, the team is assessing the impact of the incident that occurred during delivery of the new floating drydock at the end of March. DDG 119 Delbert D. Black was damaged as well as our generated testing barge and the new drydock. Now we are working with all the related stakeholders to create a path for recovery of the direct and indirect costs associated with this incident. But I want to take a moment to personally thank the Ingalls incident response team for their swift action that mitigated the damage to the ship and our property, and more importantly, resulted in no major injuries to our employees. At Newport News, the team is on track with ship erection and painting activities on CVN 79 Kennedy to support launch planned for the fourth quarter of this year. The ship is approximately 91% structurally complete with 406 of 448 lifts joined together in the drydock and approximately 58% complete overall. On the summary, program activities on SSN 791 Delaware are focused on compartment completion, system turnover and test progress to support planned delivery in the third quarter. At the same time, Block IV boats continue to perform in line with our expectations, while Block V contract negotiations are ongoing with that award expected later this year. For the Technical Solutions segment, in addition to closing the Fulcrum transaction during the quarter, the team received several key awards, including the USS Rushmore's selected restricted availability at San Diego shipyard that expanded the backlog to $1 billion. In summary, capture of key contracts continues to increase our long-term sales visibility. And as a result, backlog has now expanded to a record high of over $40 billion. All the elements of our path to 2020 strategy are on track, and our focus remains on execution in the shipbuilding business and integration of the recent acquisitions at Technical Solutions. I'm confident that all of these activities will continue to produce long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. And now I'll turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials.
Christopher Kastner: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. As I review our first quarter financial results, you may follow along with the slide presentation we posted this morning on our website. Beginning with the consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation. Our first quarter revenues of $2.1 billion increased 11% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher volumes in aircraft carriers and Navy nuclear support services at Newport News. Operating income in the quarter of $161 million decreased $30 million or 15.7% from first quarter 2018, and operating margin of 7.7% decreased 245 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by an unfavorable operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and lower risk retirement at Ingalls. Turning to Slide 5 of the presentation. Cash from operations was $11 million in the quarter, and net capital expenditures were $74 million or 3.6% of revenues compared to cash from operations of $120 million and $73 million of net capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, we contributed $10 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the quarter, of which $1 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified plans. We also repurchased approximately 184,000 shares at a cost of $36 million and paid dividends of $0.86 per share or $36 million, bringing our quarter end cash balance to $51 million. At quarter end, we had drawn $212 million on our revolving credit facility. We utilized the credit facility to fund our shipbuilding capital programs, share buybacks and dividends and the acquisition of Fulcrum. We expect to reduce the amount drawn on the credit facility as we move through the year. Moving on to Slide 6 of the presentation. Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $584 million decreased $1 million from the same period last year. Ingalls operating income of $46 million and margin of 7.9% in the quarter were down from first quarter of 2018, mainly due to lower risk retirement on the LPD program. Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation, Newport News revenues of $1.3 billion in the quarter increased 16.9% from the same period last year, mostly due to higher volume in Aircraft Carriers RCOH programs, Aircraft Carrier construction and Navy nuclear support services. Newport News operating income was $78 million, and margin of 6.2% in the quarter were up year-over-year, primarily due to volume increases in RCOH and carrier construction. Additionally, prior year results were negatively impacted by the one-time bonus payments related to tax reform. Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation. Technical Solutions revenues of $257 million in the quarter increased 10.3% from the same period last year, mainly due to the acquisition of G2 and Fulcrum. The results include a full quarter of G2 performance, which contributed revenue of approximately $7 million in the quarter and only one month of Fulcrum performance, which closed in late February and contributed revenue of approximately $13 million in the quarter. Technical Solutions operating income of $5 million in the quarter increased $3 million from first quarter 2018, primarily as a result of positive nuclear and environmental joint venture performance. Finally, we continue to expect that we'll finish the year with shipbuilding margin at 7% to 9% range, with risk retirement events weighted towards the second half of the year. We also remain confident that we will return to shipbuilding margin in the 9% to 10% range in 2020. From a cash deployment standpoint, we are on schedule to invest between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion in our shipyards, increase our dividend at least 10% annually through 2020 and utilize share buybacks to return substantially all free cash flow to shareholders from 2016 through 2020. In this regard, during the first quarter of 2019, we have returned 117% of free cash flow to shareholders. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. [Operator Instructions]. Nova, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Mike, I know you don't -- you guys don't provide quarterly guidance and that's not what this question is meant to get to. But the backlog spike that you have with some of these awards is really sort of unprecedented. And so when you think about the coming quarters, as you get some of this work, you get these contracts kind of flowing. Is that going to have a short- to medium-term impact on revenues as you get that cost into the system that we should be aware of? Just want to make sure we get our expectations right on that because it's a lot of work.
Michael Petters: Yes. I mean it's not -- I mean it's a historic moment for the business, frankly, to put that much backlog in, in one quarter, and it's incredibly exciting and creates stability for us for -- really for the next 10 years. And so we're very, very excited about that and pleased that we've been able to work our way through it. You bring up a good -- we don't just go like full board production on these programs on day one, we sign the contract, and there is a very graceful period of time where we slowly ramp up the program, starting from material procurement and then the application of labor and the fabrication. And so there's kind of a bell curve on any given program. It's kind of a bell curve, if you will, in terms of revenue that comes with it. The labor piece of it is on the second 2/3 of the program. Material procurement is kind of on the first 2/3 of the program, and there's a nice, graceful shape to that. Yes, because we have a two carrier contract. We're going to actually be able to coordinate labor from the first ship to the second. In fact, we're looking now to coordinate labor from that the Kennedy to the enterprise, so from the ship we have under contract to the first of the two ship contracts. So it just creates a very graceful move in terms of the revenue for the program for a long period of time. There will be a ramp. There will be a build up as we start to move ahead. And you'll see that it won't be in the next couple of quarters, it's going to happen over the next few years. You'll see that happen. When you take Newport News and you look at the buildup in carriers and then the extra submarine work, you can see that between material procurement and labor, hiring and role, we're going to have a pretty nice, graceful buildup there at Newport News. And it's up to us to make sure we do that as efficiently as possible. As far as the rest of the year goes, yes, I think Chris said it in his comments that this was a quarter where -- we had a really clean quarter. We didn't have a lot of opportunities to retire risk, and that comes with being on the front-end of new programs. Our risk retirement milestones are a lot closer together at the back end of the program than they are at the front-end of the program. And so we've been talking for a couple of years about how we've been making this transition, and we are going to increase the backlog a lot, and we're going to have a lot more new programs. While we're in a place now where we had a really clean quarter, we executed well across the business in all of our programs, we didn't have a lot of risk retirement milestones, and so the numbers kind of fell off where they did because of the discipline of our process. But we are very optimistic about this year and going forward. Our plan has been that we'll be in the 7% to 9% range in shipbuilding for this year, we're absolutely committed to that. And we'll be in the 9% to 10% range next year again, and we're absolutely committed to that. It's -- we did a lot of good things this quarter to get this business set up, and I'm pretty -- I'm very pleased with where we are.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of UBS.
Myles Walton: I was wondering on the polar icebreaker contract, that was, I guess, earlier -- awarded earlier the last week. Can you comment on kind of your pursuits there and if you had higher aspirations? I know you had done one in the past at Avondale but, obviously, with that plan going by the wayside, I'm curious if you had that as a aspiration. And then secondly, Mike, maybe you can comment on the M&A activity within technical services -- Technical Solutions? And give us a perspective on how much more capital you kind of want to draw into that through acquisition and kind of what's the -- what's an endgame a few years out for that business?
Michael Petters: Okay. Regarding the icebreaker, we were involved with the icebreaker from a technical standpoint, and we're interested in the program. But as the program evolved, we became -- it appeared to us that the alignment of our capacity, the budget and the requirements just didn't really match up well for us. And so while we stayed involved, technically, we made that much less of a priority for our business. Regarding Technical Solutions, we've been saying for a while that we're interested in discrete capabilities and the two most recent acquisitions are directly related to discrete capabilities that our particular customers in those areas are very interested in. We're going to continue to pursue that. Our review is that in the area -- in some of the areas that we're in, in Technical Solutions, particularly the UUV space, the DOE space and Intel communities and the cyber communities, those are areas that -- those are really for us. They're -- if you have the right capabilities, you're going to get the work. And so we're going to continue to use our balance sheet to build capability in those spaces. What we're not doing is we're not trying to go out and just build a lot of scale so that I could tell you, Myles, that three years from now, it's going to be an X billion dollar business. We're going to -- where we want to be 3 to 5 years from now is we want to be the company that our customers will call when they have a really hard problem to solve, and they don't have anybody else that can do it. So that's why we're really focused on building discrete capabilities in those areas.
Myles Walton: Okay. And just to round that out, though, you're focused on staying in the professional services end of the spectrum as opposed to your product solutions as an endgame, is that right?
Michael Petters: Yes, I'm not exactly sure how to answer that. I mean I think we're looking for the things that our customers are looking for. We're not particularly interested in like commodity-type services or interested in providing solutions. If that means that the customers is looking for some kind of platform or product, then that's what we'll provide. If that means they are looking for some kind of IP of some kind, then that's what we'll provide. So it's kind of a case-by-case basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Can you hear me now?
Michael Petters: George, great to hear from you.
George Shapiro: I wanted to know what were the EACs? And in the case of Ingalls, was the base margin lower? Because it's hard to explain all of it just by lower EACs. So if you just go through that a little bit.
Christopher Kastner: Sure. The negative adjustments were $37 million, the positive were $31 million. Newport News is 2/3 of each of those. And Ingalls was negatively impacted in the quarter, approximately $10 million, related to some contract adjustments related to EPA clauses, primarily on the DDG program where we had some negative growth and the labor and the seas. So it's unfortunate, but as Mike indicated, we've a very detailed process to manage our EACs in the quarter. This fell out, and we had to book the impact so you can see the negative adjustment related to EPA and the seas.
George Shapiro: Okay. So the base margin then at Ingalls, which has been running around 8% or a shade less hasn't changed that much, it just reflects the negative numbers this quarter.
Christopher Kastner: Not materially, no. And as Mike indicated, you just have less risk retirement events.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then just maybe one for Mike. The lower volume in DDGs and the fact you delivered the 117 with no pickup is probably due to being late. Is that the expectations going forward that these DDGs are going to be less profitable than the prior group?
Michael Petters: I think that -- I'm not sure I would say that that's with the expectation is. I mean we had to roll 117 from fourth quarter to first quarter. But I think that the fundamental issue is, can you get into a rhythm on any program? Can you get into a rhythm and then just go and be as efficient as possible? With award of the block contract that we had for destroyers last fall, that creates a pipeline of destroyers now for a pretty good run. And while there's a little bit of technical insertion there, we are looking to do pretty well on those contracts. So it's just a matter of getting into the rhythm of it. There's no question that the recovery on 119 from the incident last month is going to be -- that's just a matter of got to get that done so we can get the rhythm started. So no worries about the cost recovery, as Chris pointed out. But I think the issue now is going to get -- is to get that whole program into the production rhythm. And once we do that, I think we'll be fine.
George Shapiro: Let me just follow-up a little bit, one quick one for Chris. Chris, so you said there was, I may have misheard you, but minus 10 net EACs at Ingalls?
Christopher Kastner: No, it was a negative 37 cume adjustments, positive 31. 2/3 of each of those adjustments were Newport News. What I added was there was a $10 million negative impact related to contract clauses related to EPA and the seas at Ingalls.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv of Citi.
Colin Canfield: This is Colin on for John. Can you just talk a little bit about your capacity to pursue the frigate opportunity? I saw that getting -- sliding into FY '20. And if you have a sense of the end reward being a sole win or a split buy?
Michael Petters: Yes, so we've actually made some investment in footprint at Ingalls to be able to support fabrication of the frigate program. And it comes at a time as we wind down the end of the NSC program. We start to build up the startup of frigate program. So from a capacity standpoint, it kind of -- that is right into our program -- into our business in a very productive way. It's a Coast Guard program, kind of, move in towards the Navy program side. I'd hate to say that, that's a hot production line, but it's pretty warm. And so we would be in a pretty good shape from that. And so capacity and shipyards is part of the -- it's partly about capital, it's also partly about workforce and the large part about workforce. And so we have a ready workforce there to go do it. And I'm pretty ready for that program to go forward. As far as how the program is going to come out, there've been some changes from a big contract for 20 ships to now maybe something different than that. So we're just staying engaged with trying to help the Navy get through this as efficiently as they possibly can. We're intensely interested in the program, and we expect to be competitive.
Colin Canfield: Okay. I appreciate the color on that. And then if you're -- if we're thinking about capability versus cost on that program, have you had any indication from the customer on what they're leaning towards, whether to be higher under the capability spectrum or something a bit smaller?
Michael Petters: Well, kind of like every one of us, we want to get as much capability for the dollars as we can. And the beauty of the competition is that, that's a way for companies to actually show how to create the best bank for the buck. We think we've got a good package. We know that they certainly have some cost constraints. But at this point, we're optimistic we can meet their requirements in our cost constraints.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how's your revenue growth? And kind of in light of what you said earlier about, how long it would take for work on the two carrier buy to ramp up? You have a long-term target out there. The front-end of it, you're clearly outperforming, would suggest the risk is on the back end, but then you've kind of talked about that this is a ramp on the carriers that you have on the back end of it. So what are you looking to see before gaining some more confidence of that at your revenues?
Michael Petters: Well, we've had a -- I mean we've had a pretty incredible couple of years in shipbuilding budgeting. The historic level of shipbuilding, frankly, for most of my career, the shipbuilding account has been somewhere around $15 billion a year. And for the last couple of years, it's been just short of $24 billion or $25 million. And the quest this year is in that range again, too. And the question that -- we've talked about this before, but the question for us is, is this the new standard? Are we going to be in this $23 billion, $24 billion, $25 billion range for a while? Or are we going to, at some point, fall to that $15 billion level? And the reason that's so important for us is because it all comes down to how does Columbia get paid for. If Columbia get paid for and the budget is at $24 billion to $25 million, and that means all the other programs that we're working on continue to get funded, you continue to see follow-on procurements after the first block of frigate, there'll be another block, after the first block of destroyers, there'll be another block, after -- we've just now begun Flight II of LPDs. You can see the future on that, you can see where the LHA can fit in. You can see all of that. The question is are you going to stay at this level or are you going to come back? And we're still in -- the law of the land right now is that sequester counts. And I mean we want to see that there is going to -- there's going to have to be a sustained commitment to this current level of SCN account for us to believe that the follow-on programs are going to get funded on time and efficiently, supporting half production lines, supporting labor buildups and supporting the rhythm of the industry. At this point, we're hopeful. I guess it's the best way to put it. But we've been here for a while, we know these things can be cyclic. And the advantage we have of having these things under contract is, I think we've said about half of the backlog is already funded. So that gives us a pretty good base for quite a while over this time in front of us. A question is going to be, are the follow-on programs going to pop up in time? And that's what we'd like to see. So we need to see how we get through the next couple of years.
Christopher Kastner: Yes, as Mike indicated, the pace of the amphs is -- down at Ingalls are very important to the long-term growth rate of the company. When LHA 9 happens on an efficient basis and the LPD Flight II, the pace and when those are -- when those come to are very important.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company.
Gautam Khanna: I wanted to ask if you can just maybe outline, in 2019, some of the major risk retirement events by quarter. Just anything you can give us so that we get a sense for when we might see risk register improvements and alike so that we sort of calibrate margins correctly.
Christopher Kastner: Well, Gautam, I'll start. In Newport News, we obviously have the delivery of the Flight III submarine midyear. We had delivery of the LHA 7 midyear. I can't -- I don't want to give it to you by quarter. We just delivered NSC-8. So now we're just moving to the production cycle on the balance of the shifts. We also have the launch of CVN 73, and then towards the back end of the year, the launch of CVN 79.
Michael Petters: I mean it's across all the programs. There's milestones spread over the remainder of the year. We -- I don't know that we would -- we've ever broken up a quarter like that.
Gautam Khanna: I appreciate it. That's helpful. And then a follow-up, just in terms of acquisition or cash redeployment, I should say, are you guys still on the hunt for M&A in the Technical Services business? Or are we -- should we expect that most of the cash is just going to go to buybacks? And like you said the 10% dividend increase annually. Just curious on how we should think about use of cash going forward.
Christopher Kastner: Well, our strategy hasn't changed, Gautam. Thanks for the question. It's we're going to invest in our shipyards $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion over the five year period, and we're going to return substantial free cash flow back to shareholders, including a 10% -- at least a 10% increase in the dividend over the next couple of years. And then if we see opportunities for M&A, primarily in the TS space in the markets Mike indicated, we'll evaluate them. But we have a very disciplined process to evaluate M&A opportunities prior to executing them. But we're -- I don't know if hunt is the right word, but we continue to evaluate opportunities.
Michael Petters: Yes, I would add, hunt is the wrong word. It's -- we are just aware of the capabilities that our customers want, and we have the financial flexibility to move in those areas should it make sense. It's -- quite frankly, if you look at the valuations there, it doesn't make a lot of sense to us to just go and acquire things for financial reasons. There needs to be some strategic capability thing that we're intensely interested in to make it worth the acquisition. And that's why I keep coming back to we are not trying to build scale in that space. We're trying to build capability in very discrete areas.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag of Bank of America.
Kristine Liwag: For the $20 billion award for the CVN 80 and CVN 81, when do you expect to see a jump in revenue for this? And also since the two carrier buy when you start booking the initial margins -- when you started booking the initial margins of this program, should they be higher than it would have been if you only had one carrier buy? Or should it be lower because there's some sort of volume discount?
Michael Petters: Well, we talked earlier about, there's a very graceful ramp up in the production of the programs of those two contracts. The revenues will gradually increase, and frankly, we'll feather on to the revenue profile of the Kennedy -- the enterprise and the Kennedy will feather together. So I think if you are looking for any sort of prompt jump in the revenue profile, you won't see that. Secondly, if you are looking for some sort of prompt jump in the return on sales profile, you wouldn't see that either because now you have a contract that, really, it goes all the way out to 2032. You're going to be at the very early part of that. Clearly, there's a lot of risk that goes along with the 2032 contract. And so we put all of those things, and we just don't take credit for risk retirement until we actually retire the risk. And as we've been talking this morning, on the beginning of contracts, milestones are spaced out and pretty far apart. So we will book conservatively on the program to start with, and we will take credit when we have earned it. And that's kind of the approach we'll take.
Kristine Liwag: That's really helpful color. And may be a follow-up question on the Virginia-class. Can you quantify how much of the margin headwind you've booked as you transition from Block III to Block IV and Block V? And when does that headwind stop?
Christopher Kastner: We don't comment on specific margin rates on specific programs. I think we'll just stay with the 7% to 9% this year in shipbuilding, then 9% to 10% when we get into 2020.
Michael Petters: And we don't have the contract today for Block V yet. So where we are is we're delivering the last ship of Block III, and we're executing across the business in Block IV.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi: Mike, can you just remind us what some of the assumptions are that drives the margin improvement from this year into next?
Michael Petters: Well, it's just a matter of -- we're working through the volume of the early programs, and we'll start to see more and more milestone opportunities to take credit for the risk that we're retiring today. That's really it. The backlog increase over the last 18 months will start to mature, and we'll have more and more -- this month -- this quarter, we did not have very many milestones to hang our hat on. As time goes forward, we'll have more and more of those. And the way we see this business coming together and executing and the way we're executing today, we believe we're firmly on track for that number for next year.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay. And then you referred to the block buys as an historic moment for the company. I think is it historic event for shareholders too? Like in the context of you've never had this much visibility into carrier construction, so margins on carrier constructions longer term should be able to get to a level that they haven't been in the past. Is that a fair way to think about it or not?
Michael Petters: Well, that's certainly our objective. We believe this is good for everybody. It was -- it's good for the industry, it retires a lot of risk on the program by being able to move from one platform to the next, whether that's you're talking about labor or you're talking about the supply chain. The fact of the matter is that the two carrier contract actually retires risk, retires some of the supply chain risk in the Columbia program and in the Virginia-class program. So from that standpoint, it was all good. The job now is for us to go and capture all of the opportunity that's out there. We have great visibility, we have great leadership, we have great opportunity with our workforce and with our suppliers and with our customers. And as I say, it's put up or shut up time. And so for us, this is what we've been angling for quite a while. We're excited about the opportunity. It's going to play out over a period of time. So for folks who are interested in what might happen in a quarter, this is going to be a little bit more of a warming trend that you're going to feel. And then when you look back over several quarters, you're going to say, oh, my gosh, this is a whole lot different than it used to be. So that's kind of the way this will -- that's the way shipbuilding plays itself out, and that's the way this one will play itself out. But yes, we're really excited about it.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global.
Peter Skibitski: Sorry if this was asked, I got on a bit late. But Mike, I'm wondering what you thought when you first looked at the fiscal '20 budget and the out years and you saw some of this unmanned money in there. And I think the big program is the LUSV, I believe. How do you guys think about that in terms of strategy? Do you view it as an opportunity for you because it's really a ship? Or do you view this, hey, this is something that may be kind of compete with what we're doing right now? Or do you say, hey, we've got tons of work already, we're going to kind of ignore this type of thing? How you guys are approaching this all unmanned move that maybe is kind of starting out on?
Michael Petters: Well, first of all -- and Pete, it's a great question, but I would just point out, our job is to build the Navy the nation needs, not for the nation to buy the Navy we can build. So -- and I do personally believe that no matter what, anybody wants to do. If we're not moving towards a more unmanned future, we're going to miss an opportunity here. And so that's why we've been very focused on in building our unmanned capabilities. We went from -- eight years ago, we didn't have an unmanned capability to speak of. We have now -- we're part of the Boeing team that's going to be producing the XLUUVs. We're going to be actually manufacturing that product to support Boeing. That has given us a pretty good insight into where the UUV space is going. Capabilities that have been created and will be created for the UUV space are going to feed right into the U.S. fee space, so we're intensely interested in that space. I don't see them as being competitive to stuff that we're doing today. Frankly, if that's where the nation needs to go, then we need to be there and make sure that we get there with them and lead the way. So as we talked a little bit before about the strategy in Technical Solutions. We've -- as I said, we've kind of gone from cold iron on the unmanned space to a pretty good position on UUVs now, and we're intensely interested in the future for unmanned platforms across the whole range of Navy ships.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Just continue on the talk about carriers, Mike, with the two carrier buy since, I guess, in theory the two ships are being spec-ed in tandem, I would imagine where a lot of this cost savings comes from. Is there some increased risk of design changes on ship number two? Just because -- I don't know, is it a 3.5 year or 4 year centerline that there could be some technology evolution even in the time period that short?
Michael Petters: Well, there is always -- I mean, frankly, on every one of the platforms we built because of the -- whether it's 4 or 6 or 8 years to build it, technology continues to evolve, and the war fighters are -- they're always very interested in the latest technology. The question is, how do you mature that technology and then insert it into the platform? In some of the programs where you have multi-ship procurements, there'll be a block insertion of technology so that technology will develop in parallel to the program, and then when it's mature, it gets inserted to DDGs, have a great track record of inserting technology over the life of the ship -- over the life of the program. The submarine program also has a really great track record of inserting technology in terms of block upgrades. I mean the carriers have kind of been because they're eight year platforms, and quite frankly, since the last two ship contract we had was back in 1988. In the 30 years since then, every carrier we built for a while felt like it was the last carrier. And so as you kind of got to the end of construction, there would be real decisions about do we insert the technology now or do we deliver the ship and then try to insert the technology after delivery? The beauty of the two ship contract is that we're going to be able to work our way through that kind of in a hybrid mode where we're going to be allowed to mature technology in parallel with the construction. If is the technology is mature enough to insert it into a construction phase, we will. If it's not mature enough, then we won't. And so I don't think that by the second ship or that contract, we're going to -- I was the program manager on the second ship of the last two ship contracts, and at the very end of that, that was the -- Truman was the second ship to be delivered. At the end of that, we were making really important decisions about, hey, this is technology that we're going to insert after the ship is delivered because we know how to build this and it'll be more efficient. So there's just a stability that, that creates will allow us to get the technology right. So I'm not worried about that as a major risk.
Robert Spingarn: If they do make some design changes, though, for ship two, is that on them or on you?
Michael Petters: Well, it's on them, I mean, if that's the contract that we have. And quite frankly, what I think will happen is that if there's a desire to change the -- you may decide that you want to do something different with the volume of the carrier than what we're doing today kind of like what we did between LPD Flight I and Flight II, I don't know that it's going to show up in the second ship. I think it shows up in the next contract.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then the other thing I wanted to ask, maybe this is for Chris. But the multiple you paid for G2 at Fulcrum and whether those businesses, it looks like they contributed in the quarter. But we don't notice it on the operating income line. So I wanted to ask you about that contribution. And how we should think about the margin profile for Technical Solutions going forward?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, so both of those were about 9x when you take in the consideration of tax attributes of each. So we think we've got a very fair price for each. We still are confident in the 5% to 7% return on sales in 2020 for TS. I would add that for modeling purposes, there's about $15 million of intangibles this year related to the trend -- to each of those transactions combined. So that should help a bit in your models.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Mike, when you're speaking to the shipbuilding margin, you've expressed the confidence in returning to 9% to 10% next year. I guess when I look at those schedules, and you've alluded to the margin stepping down this year because the basic mix shift to newer work, less mature work. And when I look at the shipbuilding schedules, it looks like you'll keep mixing down to more -- higher mix of less mature work for a few years. And it's hard to go ship-by-ship on an earnings call, but I guess just bigger picture, philosophically, given how much work you've alluded to having and given how long cycle the business is, I guess why would it only be one year that you would mix shift down and then not have that continue to happen for a longer period of time?
Christopher Kastner: Let me start, Noah, this is Chris. We absolutely have a maturing of work in, especially, Newport News. We you 79 CVN 73 and then the Block IV, both maturing. So fundamentally, the majority of that uplift will be related to Newport News programs maturing in 2020. Added to that, you have two ships at Ingalls LPD 28 and 29, they're at the front-end and performing very well. So we're very confident in those as well. So you're right, I don't want do a program review ship-by-ship on earnings call, but fundamentally, the maturing of those programs at Newport News, coupled with the introduction of the new programs, and we still are very confident in the 9% to 10% return on sales.
Michael Petters: And I would just add, Noah, that I know this is "what have you done for me lately" business. But if you just go back a couple of years, you'll see that Newport News has been mixed down for a couple of years now, working their way through all of these new work. And so what they've been doing as they've been retiring risk early on and programs to get ready for some of these milestones that we see picking up next year.
Noah Poponak: Is Ingalls more on the front-end of that curve of mixing down when you look at each ship there?
Michael Petters: I think that's a little bit of what you're seeing, yes. And then you go to the budget and you see that LHA 9 has pushed out, and you see the LPDs have been stretched a little bit, and that's been the thrust of our engagement. We are very supportive of the President's budget in shipbuilding, but they could have done better in amphibs. That's -- that for us is how you kind of mitigate some of that. But yes, I think Ingalls is -- we don't expect it to be as dramatic as it was in Newport News because they have more programs, they have more multiyear stuff, their ships are smaller, and they all take this long to kind of get moving. But Ingalls has had quite a run, and they are kind of going through the shipping of gears right now to get ready for the next run.
Noah Poponak: Should we expect the Ingalls margin to be up or down in 2020 versus 2019?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, I don't want to get into specific margin rates. We just think 9% to 10% in 2020 makes sense.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And then in the 2019, 7% to 9%, is that including an expected CVN 79 launch EAC?
Christopher Kastner: No.
Noah Poponak: Okay. So it's 7% to 9%, I guess, whether or not that happens?
Christopher Kastner: Correct.
Noah Poponak: Okay. And then just one more on cash flow. You had a large positive change in working capital in the fourth quarter, and it looks like basically just a reversal of that in the first quarter. So Chris, what are you thinking for working capital for the year and the cash flow model? And I guess, kind of update us maybe on a multi-year basis, how sustainable you see having positive change in working capital?
Christopher Kastner: Well, you got it right in Q1, right? We had an exceptional Q4 last year. I think it's a bit early to update the metrics that I provided on the year-end call relative to cash flow. So we'll just move through the year and update those as we get later in the year. The team's going to work very hard at working capital, they did an exceptional job in Q4 '18, they know the objectives. And unfortunately, in shipbuilding from time-to-time, things work perfectly like they did in Q4 and then sometimes not so perfectly. So with a small amount of contracts and large invoices, they can move across the period. All I can say is we'll be on it to maximize working capital as we move through the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Krishna Sinha from Vertical Research.
Krishna Sinha: I see this morning that you guys won a $932 million contract to provide yard services for the Littoral combat ships at Ingalls. Can you just talk about your expected revenue flow-through on that program for the next few years?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. So it's a good question, and we're really excited about the award. Ingalls team did an exceptional job competing for that, and I know that we've executed very well through a partnership with our TS organization, by the way, which is a synergy that we really think is appropriate and we're excited about. But think about the revenue, it's -- so you can't just divide it by six. It's -- we think potentially around $100 million a year of sales with the slow ramp here. That's really a budgetary number that's executed annually, and there are -- at times, you don't receive the full amount. So I think $100 million -- right around $100 million annually for the next five years.
Krishna Sinha: Okay. And then you mentioned earlier being a partner with Boeing on their unmanned ship capability. Can you just talk about the cadence on those programs? And what we can expect in terms of revenue for you guys as you help build out autonomous shipbuilding?
Christopher Kastner: Well, that's a great question. I think every chart that you look at with unmanned in it starts to look like the chart from 20 years ago with unmanned aviation where there is kind of a slow, steady build momentum starts to build and then suddenly, there's knee in the curve, and everybody has got drones and everybody is flying unmanned everywhere all the time. In the unmanned ship area, especially in the unmanned undersea space, we're still in that slow, steady build of capability and experience. The physics of being underwater are just -- we haven't figured out how to repeal those logs yet. And so communication is challenging, autonomy is challenging, navigation is challenging. All of those things are big challenges that we're working our way through. At some point, I think everybody believes that there is a knee in the curve, nobody really knows when or where it is. And so for us, it was really important for us to get into the space in a pretty noticeable and important way before we get the knee in the curve. And Boeing did -- Boeing made a major investment with Eco Voyager to demonstrate capabilities in this pretty harsh environment. And we made an investment in Proteus, which is either a manned or unmanned vessel that we run out of Panama City to learn about the space. And one thing led to another and Boeing turned to us and said, can you help us manufacture a product? And so at this point, the Navy has asked Boeing to manufacture five of these. And so -- and we're working very closely in support that Boeing is going to make five, and we're working with them to do that. But we're still at the point now where we're doing the slow, steady build. We're not at the point yet where we've hit the knee, and everything is going to go to take off. And so for us, it's still about building that experience.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Joh Raviv of Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: So when you think about backlog growth, how does that tie into your risk-adjusted 3% sales growth target through 2021?
Michael Petters: Well, it's the same. I mean a lot of the backlog we assumed as we stepped out and said, okay, what are the -- how do we see this business moving ahead? We assume some of these contracts, and so far so good, I'd say.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes, I just wanted to put together the comments about getting more mature. So I went back and looked, there were total adjustments in '17 of about $200 million that were up to about $110 million in '18. So can you give us -- will the expectation for this year be lower than '18? And then for '20, we see resumption as we've got more mature. I mean is that kind of the thought process?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, I don't want to -- George, I don't want to necessarily track to the cumulative adjustments. And I think post call, maybe Dwayne and I can walk you through what you're referring to that -- I think we're just still comfortable for 7% to 9% this year and 9% to 10% in shipbuilding next year. With this year, more adjustments or more opportunities for adjustment in the back half of the year.
Operator: And our next question is the follow-up from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: I wanted to follow quickly on one of the points about margin that Noah had made earlier. And I asked about Newport News, it definitely appreciated the fact that they've had mix headwinds for the past few years. But if we look at -- some of the disclosures you guys have had from the proxies, it seems like Newport News has kind of struggled to reach the internal targets that you guys have, which presumably take account of those mix headwinds. And so as you think about the -- in that context, what sort of gives you the confidence in the margin expansion that's coming there, especially in 2020? It seems like it should be a big year for margin expansion at Newport News.
Michael Petters: Well, I'll start with that. We've had several transitions at Newport News over the past couple of years. We've had a product transitions, maturity of program transitions, we have leadership transitions. We are now digitizing the shipyards. So there've been a lot of moving parts. But as we move forward with against this backlog, a lot of that is starting to settle down. And a case in point is that we originally expected that we would be launching Kennedy in the first quarter of next year. Program team has recognized and has pursued pretty aggressively the opportunity to have a quality launch before the end of this year. I think that speaks to some of where we're going with that. Now where we are on that is there is a lot of pain happening down there. And if you want to go to see the ship and you stand still for more than a couple of minutes, you're liable to get painted yourself. But they're moving ahead, and that's the sign of where the maturity of the entire -- the technology, the capital, the leadership team, the workforce and the contract mix, we think, is coming together very nicely. So we're pretty confident on that, very confident on that.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to your President and CEO, Mike Petters, for closing remarks.
Michael Petters: Well, thank you all for joining us on the call today. As I said, we had a -- we are very excited about the future of the business. We had a really clean quarter. We've got a lot of things done this quarter that set us up for the future, and we look forward to seeing you and appreciate your interest in our business. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-14 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2018 Huntington Ingalls Industries Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Dwayne Blake, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Hayley. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in the remarks today, Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We're planning to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us again today. Before we get into the details of the call, let me first thank each of our 40,000 employees for remaining steadfast to our core principles of safety, quality, cost and schedule, which helped us produce another year of solid results. I truly appreciate the efforts you put forth in each and every day. So now let me share some highlights of our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results, starting on slide three of the presentation. Sales of $2.2 billion for the quarter and $8.2 billion for the full-year were both approximately 10% higher than 2017 and represent record highs for the company. Diluted EPS was $4.94 for the quarter and $19.09 for the full-year, both significantly higher than 2017. We received approximately $3.3 billion in new contract awards during the quarter, including contracts for NSC 10 and 11, which is the continuation of the stable serial production program for the Coast Guard. As a result, our backlog was approximately $23 billion at the end of the quarter, of which approximately $17 billion is funded. The 2-ship contract award for CVN 80 and 81 announced at the end of January is a significant step toward building these ships more efficiently and affordably. And this contract increases backlog by over $15 billion. It stabilizes the Newport News workforce, it enables the purchase of material and quantity, and it permits a fragile supplier base of more than 2,000 vendors in 46 states to phase their work more efficiently. In addition to this award, we have captured a significant portion of the shipbuilding contracts that were included in the FY'18 and '19 authorization and appropriations measures including the aforementioned NSC 10 and 11 and a six ship DDG contract received in the last quarter. As noted previously, these contracts combined with expected awards for VCS Block V, LPD 30 and future Flight II LPDs are forming the foundation to support this business for the next 10 to 15 years. Now shifting to capital deployment for a moment, I am very pleased to report that we have generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flow during the first three years of our path to 2020 strategy. This strong performance has allowed us to invest over $1 billion in the business through capital expenditures at our shipyards, invest in our employees through significant pension contributions and make bolt-on strategic acquisitions in our Technical Solutions business. At the same time, we have returned $1.6 billion of free cash flow to shareholders from 2016 through 2018. Regarding activities in Washington, the partial government shutdown had minimal impact on our business as our current work was predominantly authorized and appropriated in prior years, including the 2019 Defense authorization and appropriations measures, which were enacted into law last year. We look forward to working with the Congress during the 2020 legislative cycle to continue the serial production of submarines, destroyers, amphibious warships and National Security Cutters to leverage high production lines and supply chains and efficiently produce the warships our nation requires. While sequestration remains the law of the land for two more years, we remain hopeful that a budget agreement will ultimately be reached that will best support Defense and non-Defense discretionary needs. Now I'll provide a few points of interest on our business segments. At Ingalls, the team completed acceptance trails on DDG-117 Paul Ignatius in December and expects to deliver the ship in the first half of this year. NSC-8 Midgett remains on track and is also expected to deliver in the first half of this year. For LHA-7 Tripoli, trials and delivery are expected around mid-year. And focus continues on integration and testing to support plan trials and delivery of DDG 119 Delbert D. Black later this year. At Newport News, the team is focused on completing ship erection of CVN 79 Kennedy in the spring and painting of the hall in late summer or early fall in the support of launch planned for the fourth quarter of this year. The ship is approximately 87% structurally complete with 390 of 448 lifts joined together in the dry dock and approximately 55% complete overall. I am very pleased with the progress on the ship. In particular, of lessons learned from CVN 78 USS Gerald R. Ford and increased pre-outfitting work performed on the assembly platen and in the manufacturing shop should allow the team to continue achieving cost and schedule performance that is in line with our expectations. For submarines, the team experienced higher than expected cost in preparation for launch of SSN 791 Delaware that was completed in December. They also reassess the schedule for SSN 794 Montana, the first Block IV boat to be delivered by Newport News and the remaining boats in the Block. As a result, the EACs for Delaware, Montana and the remaining Block IV boats were increased to address the additional cost and schedule impacts. These changes resulted in a net negative cumulative adjustment of roughly $20 million in the fourth quarter. And while this situation is very disappointing, the team has the problem and taken a necessary actions to minimize these impacts. We expect to deliver Delaware and achieve pressure hull complete on Montana in the second half of this year. During the Q1 call last May, I commented that we expected the return on sales for shipbuilding to be in the 7% to 9% range for 2018 and 2019. Even with the step back in the Virginia-class program, the 2018 reported return on sales for shipbuilding was 8.6%. And we expect to remain in the 7% to 9% range for 2019 and do expect to return to the historical 9% range in 2020. Now turning to Technical Solutions, the team achieved a number of key milestones in the quarter, including the award of the O'Kane maintenance availability in San Diego and a successful transition of the Los Alamos M&O contract. During the fourth quarter, we also completed the acquisition of G2, a Maryland-based cybersecurity solutions and services company that adds advanced cyber capabilities and key federal government customers to our portfolio. And last month, we announced an agreement to purchase Fulcrum IT services, a Northern Virginia-based technology services provider that had significant capabilities in the area of C5ISR, intelligence operations, enterprise software solutions and cyber. Now these acquisitions are expected to be accretive to cash flow and earnings and strengthen our existing capabilities while adding new customer relationships, directly supporting our strategy to optimize and expand our services portfolio. This includes key new customers in the intelligence and special operations communities as well as an additional defense and federal agencies. And these relationships will allow us to incrementally grow in markets that we believe are essential for the future security of the nation and customers in these markets have another trusted partner in the Technical Solutions team. So in closing, 2018 was another solid year for Huntington Ingalls, and I am very excited about the future for our business. Strategic investments in our facilities, people and capabilities combined with key contract awards such as the CVN 80, 81 2-ship contract and the six ship DDG multiyear contract position us to leverage a unique long-term revenue visibility and stability to produce predictable low risk cash flows. In addition, our keen focus on execution, our strong balance sheet and our solid capital deployment strategy keep us on a path to continue creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. And now I'll turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Today, I will review our fourth quarter and full-year consolidated results as well as provide you with information on some items for 2019 and 2020. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Turning to our consolidated fourth quarter results on slide four of the presentation, revenues in the quarter of $2.2 billion, increased 10.2% over the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher volumes in aircraft carriers and navy nuclear support services in Newport News as well as higher volumes in the LPD, LHA and DDG programs at Ingalls, partially offset by lower volumes on the NSC program at Ingalls and the VCS program at Newport News. Operating income for the quarter of $213 million decreased $18 million or 7.8% from fourth quarter of 2017, and operating margin of 9.7% decreased to 189 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by lower risk retirement and higher than anticipated cost on the VCS program. Moving onto consolidated results for the full-year on slide five, revenues were $8.2 billion for the year, an increase of 9.9% from 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher volumes in aircraft carriers and navy nuclear support services at Newport News as well as higher volumes in amphibious assault ships at Ingalls partially offset by lower volumes in the DDG and NSC programs at Ingalls and lower volumes on the VCS program at Newport News. Operating income for the year was $951 million and operating margin was 11.6%. This compares to operating income of $881 million and operating margin of 11.8% to 2017. Higher operating income was driven by more favorable operating FAS/CAS Adjustment as well as the overall volume increases noted previously partially offset by lower operating margins. The lower operating margin was largely driven by performance on the VCS program. Additionally, interest expense was $58 million for the year, a decrease $36 million from the prior year due to the bond refinancing in December 2017. Our effective income tax rate was 3.2% for the quarter and 13.9% for the full-year, this compares to 65.8% and 38%, respectively, for fourth quarter and full-year 2017. Taxes in 2017 were impacted by the one-time effects of tax reform and discretionary pension contributions. The lower tax rates in 2018 were driven by the lower US federal income tax rate associated with tax reform and higher estimated research and development tax credits for 2011 through 2018 tax shares. Turning to cash flow on slide six of the presentation, cash from operations was $648 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $506 million. For the full-year, cash from operations was $914 million and free cash flow was $512 million, compared to 2017 cash from operations of $814 million and free cash flow of $453 million. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $142 million and for the year $402 million or 4.9% of the sales. This compares to $361 million or 4.9% of sales in 2017. Cash contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans were $546 million in the year, of which $508 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans. Additionally, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $276 million, bringing the total number of shares repurchased in 2018 to approximately 3.6 million at a cost of $788 million, of which $48 million was not yet settled for cash as of December 31, 2018. We also paid dividends of $0.86 per share or $37 million in the quarter bringing total dividends paid for the year to $132 million. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we acquired G2 for total cash consideration of $77 million. Now turning to slide seven, let me provide an update on pension. We project a favorable net FAS/CAS Adjustment of approximately $159 million in 2019, and approximately $161 million in 2020. expected 2019 FAS/CAS Adjustment initially provided on our third quarter earnings calls update is due to higher year-end CAS interests rates and lower than projected asset returns in 2018. CAS recoveries over CAS contributions are projected to be approximately $237 million in 2019 and approximately $103 million in 2020. Now let me provide you with an update for some additional 2019 items as shown on slide eight. We expect the non-current state income tax expense to be in the $9 million to $13 million range and our effective income tax rate to be approximately 21%. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $60 million for the year and capital expenditures as a percent of sales is expected to be between 5% and 6%. Also, depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $210 million. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be between 4% and 5% of sales in 2020. We now expect our capital expenditures between 2016 and 2020 to be between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. As a reminder, capital expenditures are expected to return to the historical level of approximately 2.5% of sales in 2021. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up. So we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Hayley, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Myles Walton of UBS. Your line is now open.
Myles Walton: Hey, Mike, I was hoping you could touch on the VCS? And how much of -- of which you're experiencing as a result of moving to the new contract structure on the Block IV? It sounds like you're kind of bridging the two. And also the -- kind of the late delivery that was called at this summer, how much of that have you recovered from in these contracts? Just give us some colors that you've kind of bounded the issue, obviously, you've adjusted that EAC accordingly? But how much was the result of transition sort of Block IV? How much is a result of increase in rates? And, again, give us some assurance that you've founded the issue?
Mike Petters: Yeah, I'll start and then maybe I'll let Chris talk to the rates issues. We have as a sort of core principle of at least my career is, you should launch no ship before its time. And as we were heading up to launch on Delaware, our approach to a quality launch there we started to recognize that to get to where we wanted to be on that ship for a launch, there was both cost and schedule pressure. So we don't launch until we're ready. So when we -- when the launch got delayed, we had to step back and say what were the root causes of that and what is that mean to us, not just on this particular program and Delaware is the last ship of Block III. But is there something that we do account for in our risk register in Block IV. And so that process is a very -- it's a routine process that we go through in our EAC process every quarter. But also the risk management process is very, very disciplined. And so as we went through that process, we recognized that we needed to reflect that in the risk registers for Block IV. So we did both of that. We took the program adjustment for Delaware, but also adjusted Block IV. And we also accounted in the ongoing negotiations we're having for in Block V. We absolutely believe that the problem is a rather challenge that we experience is bounded. The team is -- they recognize how they got here and they recognize the approach to get through it. I feel very confident about where the submarine program at Newport News is. And I'm also pretty excited about the future of that program as we go forward. So I'm -- this is was a routine adjustment that caught us on the cusp between Block III and Block IV, and so that's why it kind of shows up the way that it does. But I'm very confident about where that program is going to go in the future.
Myles Walton: And then, Chris, you gave us the color on the 2021 CapEx coming back towards a normalized level? What is the net CAS recovery after pension contributions look like in terms of post 2020? In a deck you're showing an uptick in the cash contributions required by the company and decline in the case of CAS. Post 2020, are those two things more or less neutralized?
Chris Kastner: Yeah. So they definitely wind down a bit. I'm not comfortable providing 2021 data at this point. Trying to get you '19 and '20 from a planning standpoint that FAS/CAS and contribution start to normalize subsequent to '20, for sure all things being equal, of course.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Doug Harned: I wanted to go to the Ingalls for a minute. The -- you're just -- you've been getting good margins at Ingalls and you're just in the early stages of ramping up on the Jack Lucas and the Ted Stevens. So as you get into these Flight III boats, how should we think about the margin trajectory with that transition to Flight III?
Chris Kastner: We're -- as Mike indicated on his prepared remarks, we're still comfortable returning the 9% return on sales in 2020, and the Flight III boats or Flight III ships are in that mix. So we're comfortable with how those ships are starting and we're comfortable with that 9% return on sales projection.
Mike Petters: Yeah, I'd go little just maybe expand on that, Doug. You know, across the whole business we will be -- we're starting up now, we're adding to launch on Kennedy but we're now behind Kennedy we have two more carriers to build. We're at the very beginning of Block IV and we're negotiating the Block V contract at Newport News. We have the steady refueling business at Newport News. We're coming through the second half of a refueling and will beginning -- the beginning of the planning phase for the next refueling. At Ingalls, we have 10 destroyers now under contract to build. We are negotiating the first ship of Flight II of LPDs and we are in a place where we just signed a contract for two more NCSs, NSC 10 and 11. And then across the whole range of the business, all of our programs are -- were getting the business into the production lines that are hot. And even though there's a -- the backlog is expanding pretty dramatically. We're in a place where we feel pretty comfortable that next year we're going to back into 9% to 10% range. And that's going to be across the whole business, there would be pieces of it, that will be -- because the risk registers we won't be at that level, there would be other pieces that the risk registers are going to be in a good place and we'll be above that. So at a blended rate we believe that in very short order, even though the backlog was expanding as quickly as it is. In very short order we're going to be in that healthy 9% to 10% range and we're pretty excited about that. Whether that's going to happen exactly the way that we see it play out, you know, this is ship building. So we'll see. But I've said this is the most exciting time that I've seen in shipbuilding and this is when it gets really good now. The orders are in the book and the team can get cut close to go execute those orders.
Doug Harned: And then talking ships little bit the you've done to acquisitions in the government IT space here recently. What we've seen in that space is a lot of consolidation and arguments by some of the larger players that you really needs scale both for cost and for the market. And so as you pull these together I mean you are well below the scale of many of these other large companies. I mean how do you think about competing at the size you're at in that space? Or do you feel what's the scale you think you would need to make that really successful?
Mike Petters: Yes good question Doug. I think of the scale issue we don't look at it the same way. We and that may be because we just record that smart. But I think that we post that we've taken without navy customer for decades has been to understand the customer well enough to understand what capabilities they need then go invest in those capabilities so that you can become the preferred partner for that customer. In this space whether it's cybersecurity or data analytics and those kind of things when we acquired Kimball we brought on several new customers and we've gone through a pretty rigorous evaluation of what are the capabilities that those customers are going to need for where they are going to be in the future. And then we've been pretty selective about go and build that capability in our business. And both G2 and full-term are exactly that. I don't believe that you can we just successful by being made. I think you're going to have to be intimate to the customer you're going to have to be talking to them about what capabilities they need and then you've got to go her figure out how to create that capabilities so that they have it when they need. And we're excited about the approach because it helps us become more intimate with these customers over time and we become a much more interested partner. And we think that that's going to be the foundation of a very successful services business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Just two quick ones probably both for Chris. One just explaining on Myles question and your answer Mike it sounds like we should be thinking to block four booking rate on DCS is lower exit the various and whatnot if you can just confirm that for us? And then secondly on the cash flow were there any working capital elements of significance that represented a pull forward of some good guys into Q4 2018 versus 2019? Anything we should be aware of?
Chris Kastner: Yes so I'll handle the last one first. So we did have a good Q4 and working capital both receivables and payables. Grad paid early on some stuff that we weren't really expecting its testament to the team that was working cash over the year to ensure that we maximize it so that we did have a positive working capital quarter for sure. And Mike you want to handle the DCS but we don't specifically give bookings in the program.
Mike Petters: I mean this was a, I would say for the sides for this size of the program for block 4 this is a relatively small adjustment for that.
Carter Copeland: Okay Chris if you could help us quantify how should we think big some of that good news in Q4 on the cash flow was?
Chris Kastner: Yes you can think between $100 million to $150 million right at the end of the year that came in because of the team is working very, very hard at it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse.
Rob Spingarn: Following on but what Carter just as you, given the word on forward Chris can you talk a little bit about the trend from this year to next year beyond pension and CapEx? How should we think about the various puts and takes into 2019? And then separately if you could give us the growth in that EIS adjustments in the segment?
Chris Kastner: So I'll give you gross and net first. Positive of 62 and negative of 50. Ingalls was a positive 30 and Newport News was a negative 18. From a free cash standpoint what I intended to do this year on this call was give you all the various factors that influence cash flow at HII the nonrecurring type of items. So depreciation amortization capital net pension cash and then everything else is just working capital and that's timing related. And as you know as you saw in Q4 you may have seen be a bit lumpy. So hopefully I've given you more information where you can understand how cash flow within a corporation.
Rob Spingarn: But over the years should we expect it to be similar 2019 from 2018. In other words you have another you works some of that strong Q4 in the early part of 2019 and then you catch up at the end of the year?
Chris Kastner: We're going to work very hard to ensure that happens.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Raviv of Citi.
Jon Raviv: Sorry to keep on this cash flow question but maybe just a little more specific. I think at the beginning of the year you've talked about having specific headwind and tailwinds in the 2019 that sort of implied $750 million of cash free cash in 2019? Pension moved through in the year such that on the last call some of that cash went away. Ratings at all levels of the level of free cash flow you expect to be able to say in that maybe next couple of years CapEx in the side pension?
Chris Kastner: Yes Jonathan I appreciate the question. And as you know we don't provide that residential what I tried to do is give you all the components that make up cash flow. I really would rather not give you directional and my thoughts relative to how it's going to be prepared to 2018. But I think you can probably get there with the information that I provided.
Jon Raviv: Okay and then I have a follow-up in terms of the sustainability. Mike you have talked about for a while your business being flattish and up 3% and now up 10%. To what extent is this new level in 2018 almost a base of which you claim or given all the backlog that you've been able to build or you were to some risk that started going down and again at some point kind of even at not that risk adjusted normalized you talked about previously?
Chris Kastner: And Jonathan I apologize i did not hear you very well. I think the question was about growth. This is Chris and Mike can chime in subsequent that we are still confident with 3% CAGR 2017 through '22. obviously we had pretty good 2018. But we don't really don't expect that to continue obviously because of Los Angeles submarine work will finish this year. And then tailwind 2020 potentially. So we're feel still comfortable with that sort of growth rates for those years in shipbuilding.
Mike Petters: Lead back and I would just go and find out that what what's actually going to happen have beyond the persistent 3% growth in shipbuilding is that backlog is going to put us in a place where we're going to be able to talk about not just five years but 10 years. And we'll be able to talk to a pretty persistent growth rate across a decade that's going to be for a work we have under contract that is buy and large immune to some of the winds that might blow politically. So that gives us a lot of confidence in terms of the foundation of our business with our core customer we think that puts us in a very unique spot.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Chris if I heard you right you had a $20 million negative adjustment from the DCS. If I exclude that in Newport would have been about 6%. Is that what we should expect for the quarter's this year or is that on the low side?
Chris Kastner: Well that's getting on a run rate sort of margin for a return on sales for Newport News in the quarter. Obviously there will be opportunities for step ups as we achieve milestones at both ship yards. So well it is run rate that's not how we think about return on sales within the year.
George Shapiro: Yes because you had mentioned I thought I got it right that net adjustments in Newport remind us 2018. So roughly taking out the 2018 you kind of get this is the underlying base rate for Newport News? And then as a question of what you can do on EAC adjustments et cetera?
Chris Kastner: I think that's there George.
George Shapiro: Okay and then for Mike. The 3% sales growth you've talked about in the past had that assumed all of the business that you know seem to be getting the two Ford carriers and stuff? Or is there incremental from the business you got?
Mike Petters: Yes I think that when we first talked about the 3% the two carrier contract for instance was being talked about but not I think was uncertain. The destroyer piece was uncertain at that point. I think where we are now as that we're very confident about the 3% because of the work that we've captured. There are some things out there that frankly we'd like to see that could help this move along more. If you can do for instance if you can do a two ship by for Aircraft Carriers you can do also do ship by for LHAs. We've got figure out a way to get the LHA program back in phase because it's out of phase right now. And we got to do that as very efficiently as we can from a shipbuilding perspective we've got a LHA seven and LHA 8. But LHA nine and LHA 10 are out there and they are not in phase. So we've got to get to those in phase. So that remains to be seen. We're negotiating the first contract of flight two LPDs. The best way to build the flight two LPS would be to move to a multiyear contract. So we need to go do that. So those are things out there that would enhance our view the frigate program is out there and that will enhance our view. So while we saw defied around the 3% because of the work that we've done we're still out there doing more of this to try to be as efficient as we can.
George Shapiro: And then just one quick follow-up, so given how much higher than 3% the growth was this year I mean what caused that? There were unique items in there that you didn't foresee? Or if you can explain a little further?
Mike Petters: Yes George that was driven by the LA class submarine availabilities the three boats that we had in Newport News in 2018.
Operator: Our next question comes from Krishna Sinha of Vertical Research Partners.
Krishna Sinha: I think in late December you want a sub safe contract for $875 million. And then I think recently you also have the opportunity for something like $400 million on option period 3 for some MTV ships work for the Chief of Naval operations. Can you just talk about how those revenues flow through over the and over what time period you're going to see those revenues?
Chris Kastner: I'm not entirely sure the awards you're referencing I apologize. But all of the all the awards we had in the fourth quarter and the perspective that Mike previously gave relative to the growth rate.
Krishna Sinha: So are you seeing any incremental sort of opportunity for maintenance or MRO work. I know that sort of ad hoc and it comes on and off. But any not on the LA class particularly but any other work that you're seeing coming down the pipe that could be incremental to the growth rate?
Mike Petters: Well I think that there is a bigger strategic issue around how is the Navy going to try to do maintenance going forward. There's been a challenge in terms of their readiness they they've talked about. And as they moved the resources towards more readiness, they've also been talking with the whole industry about how do we do that more strategically. We're certainly engaged in our discussion with the Navy but it's very premature at this point to try to talk about what impact that might have on our particular business. The LA class is actually an example of sort of the dynamics of that space in terms of those were pop-ups that we were available that we were able to do. But right now we can't forecast what after that. So and I think that sort of the challenge of that space historically has been the unpredictability of it and the volatility of it. So I think that the discussion is going on between the government and the industry right now. So how do we do this on a more efficient way which would drive out some of the volatility. And if we can do that then we can start to project that into our into our look ahead. But we're really not able to do that right now.
Krishna Sinha: And then just one maybe one final one on free cash flow, everybody's kind of harping on this. But I'm just curious from your perspective pension obviously is a noisy's sort of metric and it's going to harmonize at some point. If we just exclude the pension if we normalize CapEx. What's the sort of underlying free cash flow that we can expect from this business on a go-forward basis. Like what's normalized free cash flow look like for this business?
Chris Kastner: Yes so I apologize again but we don't provide guidance. What I've tried to do is give you all the variables that impact cash. And addition to that we provide top line and where we think we're going to be from a return on sales standpoint and what the tax rates going to be. So I think based on the information I provided you can get to a fairly consistent or number that you can count on. Obviously working capital moves around a little bit in that it can be lumpy at times. But with I think with the information I provided you can arrive at a fairly reasonable number.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: A couple of quick questions. Back to the revenue growth question. I think everybody's kind of scratching up that one. Largely because it seems with the business you've won and the business you could win that 3% number just seems really low right? I mean that how could you possibly not hit that? I mean I guess the question is how could you possibly not do better than that? That's the first question.
Chris Kastner: Well the answer Ron this is Chris. And I consistently said if things go perfectly it could be better but you have there are constraints within a shipyard. There's only so many boats you can build at the same time. So it's not as if we get these orders and they provide for immediate sales growth. What they do provide for is amazing stability within our business space. So it's not as if it immediately show up in sales and margin.
Ron Epstein: And then maybe I don't if this asked or not but I'll ask it again if it was I mean when we think margins on the two carriers how should we think about that as we go from CVN 80 to 81?
Chris Kastner: Well I think certainly we've got a contract here that's going to carry us out to 2032. So we have a pretty large this register at this point. And as we with all of the advantages come us along are historic and very disciplined process for making sure that we don't retire the risk before we've actually retired it. Now what happens here is that as you are going through the first ship it's really going to be the third ship in the class. And so you're going to be able to take advantage of what's you've learned from the first 2. And you'll have opportunities where you're at high risk on the first ship and you'll decide that maybe that's not a risk on the second ship. So there'll be a progression just like it is on any other program it's just going to be a 13-year curve as supposed to a 8-year curve or a 5-year curve that we have on other programs.
Ron Epstein: Got you. Got you. And then maybe just one more for you just quick one. On the CapEx outlook in 2021 how many summary instances are resumed are being built?
Chris Kastner: That's the current program of records. I think the question around submarines is it as the industry has been expanding itself to be able to handle the two submarine per year delivery rate in Virginia-class as well as support the Columbia program. Discussions about future submarines and adding more submarines to the budget I mean that's been a very loud discussion and we stand ready to support that. But the capital that sort of things if you just going to add one or two ships to the budget along the way and kind of option them in. They're not really won't require substantially more capital. That would just be putting them back into our production line and working them through the process. If the nation were to decide that they wanted to go some other build rate. We're we wanted to go to a three Virginia-class stream extreme be and go to a three Virginia-class per year build rate confirm with the Columbia-class program. Then that would probably require another thought on capital. But we are not seeing that being the discussion today and so we feel pretty comfortable with the capital investments that we've made on the BCS program. And even if they add a ship here or a ship there we think that that will be that we're in we're well positioned to support that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Douglas Harned of JPMorgan.
UnidentifiedAnalyst: So the new to the stock so I apologize for this pretty basic. But just thinking about that shipyard margin this year coming in at around 8.6 and getting kind of on way into the 9% to 10% range in 2020. And thinking about the moving pieces there And you're very much above the range at Ingalls. And so that implies I guess better significantly better margins on the carrier even as you look at it after you've signed the contract for 2. And improving margins on the Virginia not being offset too much by the absence of that Los Angeles cross work. Is that the right way to think about the margin moments that allow you to bring of the Newport News margin?
Chris Kastner: I think the way to think about this and welcome to the stock. I think the way to think about our ship building businesses is that brand new programs are going to be booked very conservatively because we just we have too many scars where we've gotten out in front of our head lights. And so we went to be conservative in new programs. Very mature programs we can where we understand where the risk is we will be more aggressive. Where we are right now is that we have a tremendous amount of new work at Newport News. And so as a result we're being pretty conservative at Newport News. And on the other hand at Ingalls we've got some pretty mature programs there. And we're hot production lines. So we're in a place where we can be more aggressive. Both teams are executing exceptionally well and we we're of the work that they are doing and the positioning that they are making to accelerate into the next decade. And that's across all of our programs. And so our view is that the healthy blended business of shipbuilding ought to be a mix of very mature product lines with the significant volume of new work and then that blended that puts you in a 9% to 10% range. We've been very consistent about that since we left we still believe that to be the case. And we expect that even with all of the new work that we're taking in Newport News in the next we've taken it on and in the across the rest of this year. We expect that our blended rate next year is going to be in 9% to 10% range we're pretty comfortable with that. So we're excited about where this positions us because it does put us in the healthy place for the next five to 10 years.
UnidentifiedAnalyst: Great. And then I'd say here is a quick follow-up for Chris just even we few take out the $150 million of cash that kind of pulled into the fourth quarter it still implies on the positive working capital contribution to cash flow in 2019. Just want to make sure A that's correct? And kind of like what's driving and given that we've got this growth underway? And at some point does that become more, more of a neutral or headwind on the working capital front since you're growing?
Mike Petters: Yes so I we do have good terms with our customers so working capital doesn't as we grow working capital does not increase that much. So it's all about timing with working capital with us and what happens around the end of the month. So you're correct relative to the pull forward. And we'll just see how 2019 goes.
Operator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible].
Unidentified Participant: Couple of questions. You mentioned the 7% to 9% margin range this year. Can you remind us of how many ship you have this year I think it's 5? And how that compares last year? Just obviously you guys are conservative but typically we've seen margins kind of move up on upon delivery. Is there anything different about the programs you're delivering on this year relative to history. I'd appreciate some color.
Chris Kastner: So we have five ship deliveries we have Delaware and then for angles two DDGs LHA seven and NSC-8. So it's going to be normal course of when we evaluate over risk registers when those ships delivers and if we have an opportunity we'll book some additional margin.
Unidentified Participant: Okay Chris you also I mean cash flow question has been announced many, many times. But obviously when we look out to in the past you've talked about her Avondale recovery being sort of a nonrecurring plus in 2018 and then maybe it bleeds into 2019. Could you refresh our understanding of whether that's behind us now and what it was in terms of actual dollar value last year 2018?
Chris Kastner: Sure. Avondale is behind is now. We've recovered that. I think that was $15 million that went into AR from an inventory related to Avondale. But we did get you the information. So that is absolutely behind us we saw in the facility the restructuring is fully and that's covered.
Unidentified Participant: Okay. So just putting it all together ex working capital dynamic in Q4 just wanted to be clear because that I think there's some confusion. It's looks like the cash flow the things you've identified is about $200 million may a little bit $220 million year-to-year plus between the sling and the mismatching cash pension versus contribution the CAS recovery versus contribution. The increase in tax rate and the slight increase in CapEx year-to-year in 2019. Is that fair something in the $220 million range ex working capital changes?
Chris Kastner: Yes I'll not going to comment on where I think it's going. I've given you all the information would on the tax rate we have not that's book tax, the cash tax will that will settle out 2019 or '20 when we get agreement with the IRS. So I'm being punished by giving too information here unfortunately. So I tried to give you all the factors that influence cash flow. You saw what happens in working capital in 2018 and that potential effect that can add for 2019. And I think there's enough information for you to derive a reasonable estimate for 2019 and 2020.
Unidentified Participant: Last one for me on CVN 79 give you as sort of any kind of commentary on EICs in the quarter? And whether that was a source of any variance either way.
Mike Petters: Nothing material. We're pleased with how 79 is progressing.
Chris Kastner: Right. yes we've been as we've been program team set up a target for launching this ship earlier and moving the launch into 2019 from 2020. They've been pretty steady and persistent at achieving the things they need to achieve get done. We're encouraged by that packet and it's been holding the line for quite a while now. So that program is coming together. And I think even more importantly now with more two behind it becomes a really important key foundation for the future of the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays.
David Strauss: Following up on that in terms of the Kenny launch. So it safe to assume or I guess you guys are assuming that the launch doesn't occur in 2019 and in your margin guidance 7% and 9% margins? And how big of a swing factor is that in terms of margins in 2019 as to whether that occurs or not?
Mike Petters: Yes we don't give specific projections of what we think that might be. We have to execute it a then evaluated. As not necessarily even without the launch we believe we can get to 9% to 10% return on sales range for next year. There's a lot of things going on in 2020.
David Strauss: Okay. Question on CAS recovery it seem like on the last call I don't think you were on it Chris. but seems Like they were tempering an idea that CAS will drop off. You focus a pretty big CAS drop off from 2019 and 2018. And it sounded like in the prior call you were potentially talking about another big drop off in 2020 but that number we're seeing here is that our result of the performance in 2018 or how do we think about CAS recovery levels longer term?
Chris Kastner: Yes I'll give you 2019 and '20. '21 it does come down a bit and that a little less than we thought in '20 driven by discount rates and asset returns. But you should see beyond '20 metering down a bit along with FAS and contributions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi: Just a quick one for Chris. Does the you have for the block five for CVN effective program accounting for 79 in anyway?
Chris Kastner: No.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay. And then Mike you've talked about how healthy shipyard the 9% or 10% margin on average I think maybe I'm coming up with the on average part of that. But you're obviously little bit below that now. I'm wondering if you have kind of line of sight into when margins could be better than that just based on a lot of it being the block 5 as this CVN can go from kind of a dilutive margin to non accretive margin four or five years whether you actually have line of sight into a few-year period remarks can actually be better than average?
Mike Petters: Yes. I would, interesting question. Frankly my view is that if we get too far above the 10% range what that will indicate is that we're not backfilling the work. And so while it would feel really good because you got a really good number. It's not exactly the healthiest place for you to be. And so our intent our focus will be getting the risk registered retire. So we can optimize the return on these programs. If we see that we have a different outlook at that point we will. But more importantly we're going to be working hard to try to continue to backfill the work so we keep that were added late in the healthy range.
Operator: And it's a time I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn it over to Mike Petters, President and CEO for any closing comments.
Mike Petters: Well we thank you all for your interest in the business. We continue to focus on execution and the work that's happening across the full range of our business. We appreciate your interest and your time today and we look forward to seeing you in the future. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This test as of the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-11-08 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Q3 2018 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks Ira. Good morning. And welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries’ third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President of Business Management and CFO is out with the flu. So Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer and I will be handling the call today. As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that not historical facts, are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also, in our remarks today, Mike and I will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix to our earnings presentation that is posted on our Web site. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our Web site at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation, as well as our earnings presentation. Mike, I'll turn the call over to you.
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. And I want to pass along our best wishes to Chris, I hope he feels better, I hope this call will help him feel better. Good morning to everyone else and thanks for joining us. Today we released third quarter 2018 financial results that continue to meet our performance expectations for the business. So let me share some highlights starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Our sales of $2.1 billion for the quarter were 12% higher than the third quarter 2017. Diluted EPS was $5.29 for the quarter, compared to $3.27 last year. We received approximately $2.8 billion in new contract awards during the quarter include full funding for the first two ships of the flight 3D DDG competition. As a results our backlog was approximately $22 billion at the end of the quarter of which approximately $17 billion is funded. The six ship DDG contract represents one of the first awards that will form the foundation to support the business for the next 10 to 15 years on the horizon our CVN 80 and 81, VCS block 5, NSC 10 and 11 and LPD Flight 2. As noted during our first quarter earnings call all of this contracting activity supports our sales outlook for the next five years and is expected to result in the award of base contracts or options to be exercised for 20 to 30 ships by the end of 2020. Turning to capital deployment for a moment during our November 2015 investor day meeting, we committed to investing in the business through CapEx and returning substantially all free cash flow to shareholders through dividend increases of at least 10% annually and share repurchases. Since that time we have made substantial progress in modernizing our shipbuilding facilities at Ingalls in Newport News by investing over $900 million in capital expenditures. In addition, we have increased our dividend in excess of 10% each year and our most recent increase from $0.72 to $0.86 per share announced yesterday continues this commitment. And we have also repurchased 4.9 million shares at a cost of roughly $1 billion from 2016 through the third quarter of this year. Regarding activities in Washington the President recently signed a minibus appropriations bill for 2019 that included funding for the Department of Defense and other agencies. We’re very encouraged by the support for Navy shipbuilding in the final appropriations measure, which includes the following. Alignment with the National Defense Authorization Act permitting funding for CVN81 under two carrier buy if anticipated savings can be confirmed. Funding for LPD flight 2 advance procurement material for either LPD 31 or for several ships across the future multiyear procurement. Funding to accelerate the purchase of advance procurement material for LHA 9 as well as R&D money to accelerate the purchase of LHA 9 to 2021 and increased funding for the DEG program. We continue to urge lawmakers to proceed expeditiously in finalizing the FY19 appropriations for those agencies that are currently under a continuing resolution. For the 2020 budget request we are hopeful that we can continue to leverage our hard ship building production lines and critical supply chains to affordably achieve fleet requirements address the challenges identified by the administration's recently released report on the industrial base. Now I will provide a few points of interest on our business segments. At Ingalls the team delivered NSC 7 Kimball in September and is striving to complete test and deliver NSE 8 Midget early next year on the DEG program the team completed builder trials on DDG 117, Paul Ignatius last month and is focused on completing exceptions trials in Q4 with delivery expected in the first half of 2019. For DDG 119 Delver D Black, the focus continues on integration and testing to support plan trials and delivery late next year. On LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale continues to perform well on both costs and schedule and a focus for LHA 7EEE is on the test program with trials and delivery expected next year. At Newport news CVN 79 Kennedy is nearing completion of manufacturing work and the team is beginning to utilize transformation initiatives such as integrated digital shipbuilding to support construction activities, the ship is approximately 84% structurally complete with 376 of 448 lifts joined together in the dry dock and approximately 53% complete overall. The team lowered the final piece of the ships under water hull into place at the end of September which completes the erection of all the ships structures from main deck down. These activities support the teams plan to achieve an earlier launch of the end of next year. I continue to be very pleased with the progress on the ship and look forward to seeing the team meet this commitment. For submarine SSN 791 Delaware was recently christened and remains on track to deliver in the first half of next year, this is a final block three boat to be delivered by Newport News. Turning to technical Solutions the US Department of Energy's National nuclear security administration issued a notice to proceed for the management transition process at Los Alamos National Laboratory to Triad National Security, LLC. After four month transition period, the joint venture team will assume full management and operational responsibility for the laboratory and technical solutions is an integrated subcontractor to the joint venture team. Additionally, improving energy market conditions are beginning to translate into modest profitability in the oil and gas business. In closing, it's clear that the focus on execution in our shipbuilding business is the primary reason behind the favorable outcome for programs in the FY19 minibus appropriations bill and prior year appropriations and recognizing this we’re focused on negotiating fair and profitable contracts that grow the top line while remaining steadfast in our commitment to execution on our shipbuilding programs by keenly focusing on safety, quality, cost and schedule. These efforts, combined with solid execution by a technical solutions team and a capital deployment strategy that invests in our shipyards while returning excess cash to shareholders keep us on a path to continue creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. So before I turn the call over to Dwayne for some remarks on the financials and this part probably isn't going to make Chris feel as good, let me share a few thoughts on our pension strategy. He always gets nervous when I think about pension. With higher discount rates used to established cash contributions were introduced with pension relief under the moving ahead for progress act in 2012 our senior leadership team made a conscious decision to stay with market base rate in lieu of safe harbor rates. This caused our tax expense to be higher in the short-term because of the use of lower market base rates with the expectation the cash expense would be lower in the future. At the same time we were able to make discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans, and recover those contributions in our overhead rates. Our view was that as a company with a long horizon our future cost position would be more competitive as a result of lower future cash expense and we could move our qualified pension plans closer to being fully funded. As a result of favorable funded status of our plans and the recent increase in discount rates, consistent with our strategy, we anticipate a decrease in our cash expense and fast cash adjustment over the next few years. This in turn will make our business more competitive and our products more affordable. So now I'll turn the call over to Dwayne Blake for some remarks on the financials.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Mike. As I review our third quarter financial results and provide a few updates to the full year. Please follow along with slide presentation we included with our earnings release, this morning. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation we had another strong quarter as revenues of 2.1 billion increased 12% over third-quarter 2017 due to increased volume in our ship building segments. Operating income in the quarter of 290 million increased 49 million or 20% from third quarter 2017 and operating margin of 13.9% increased 99 basis points. These increases were primarily driven by higher segment operating income and a favorable change in the operating sales tax adjustment in the quarter compared to the same period of 2017. Turning to Slide 5 of the presentation, cash used in operations was 93 million in the quarter after contributing 434 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plan. This includes the final portion of 508 million discretionary contributions to our qualified plans in 2018. Free cash flow in the quarter was a use of 195 million and year-to-date free cash flow was 6 million. Net capital expenditures in the quarter were 102 million, or 4.9% of revenue, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately 5% of revenue. We returned 130 million to our shareholders in the quarter, by repurchasing approximately 412,000 shares at a cost of 99 million and paying 31 million in dividends, bringing our cash balance at the end of the quarter to 68 million. Now to segment results on Slide 6 of the presentation. Ingalls results in the quarter of 694 million increased 17% from the same period last year driven by increased volume on LHA, LPD and NSE programs, partially offset by lower volume on the DEG program. Ingalls operating income of 82 million in the quarter was up 8 million year-over-year, primarily because of higher revenues. Ingalls operating margin in the quarter of 11.8% was 66 basis points lower than the same period last year primarily due to lower risk retirement on LPD 27, partially offset by higher risk retirement on the NSC program. Turning to Slide 7, of the presentation, Newport News revenues of approximately 1.2 billion in the quarter increased 12% from the same period last year mostly due to higher volumes in aircraft carriers and navy nuclear support services. Please keep in mind that the increase in Navy nuclear support services volume is primarily driven by Los Angeles class submarines maintenance and overhaul active, while this is good work we expected to start ramping down towards the end of next year and therefore do not consider it to be a sustainable source of long-term revenue growth. Newport News operating income of 119 million and margin of 10.1% in the quarter were up 23 million and 98 basis points year-over-year respectively, mainly due to a $43 million workers compensation benefit in 2018 due to favorable medical and loss experience trends, and a higher discount rate. This was partially offset by the resolution of contract changes on CVN 65 and CVN 72 in 2017. Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation. Technical Solutions revenues of 245 million in the quarter increased 1.7% from the same period last year driven by higher oil and gas and mission driven innovative solutions revenues partially offset by lower fleet support and nuclear and environmental revenue. Technical solutions operating income of 16 million and margin of 6.5% in the quarter, decreased 6 million and 260 basis points year-over-year respectively, primarily due to the release of a portion of an accounts receivable allowance related to the Westinghouse bankruptcy filing in third-quarter of 2017, partially offset by improved performance in oil and gas services. Before we transitions Q&A let me address a couple of additional life, we completed the sale of our Avondale facility in Q4 and the final details of the transaction within our expectations, so there are no material impact to earnings or cash. We expect 2018 interest expense to be approximately 59 million and our effective income tax rate to be approximately 18%. Turning to Slide 9 in the presentation. We have updated our 2019 pension and postretirement benefits outlook. Note that 2019 projected cash expense and cash contributions are down by 92 million and 32 million respectively from our previous outlook provided during the fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. These reductions are driven by higher discount rates. Projected 2019 total FAS expenses up by 3 million, primarily due to an assumed 0% adds of return in 2018 partially offset by higher discount rates. Consequently, 2019 FAS/CAS adjustment has also decreased from prior outlook and is now projected to be 234 million for the year. Please remember that pension related numbers are subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria and as in the past we provide you with an updated pension estimates for 2019 and 2020 on the fourth quarter call. That concludes my remarks, so let's turn to Q&A for a moment and as a reminder, please remember to limit yourself to one initial question and one follow up, so we can get as people through the queue as possible. Sarah I will turn the call over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Your line is now open.
Jon Raviv: It’s a pension and free cash flow question, so guys have previously talked about 2019 free cash flow being in the neighborhood of $750 million, with the lower net pension cash items and would it be fair to think of that, that 750 is a bit lower in 2019. And then just rolling forward from there, how do you think about sustainability of that number given what you guys have strategically approached the pension as we talked about earlier Mike with the pension net cash rolling off be able to be offset by lower CapEx for example. Thank you.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks Jon and so when you think about the free cash outlook remember 2018, we talked about in essence, to be about 100 million headwinds from where we finished last year, so that would directionally put you in a 350ish range. You talk about the 400 million headwind and you're right, you look at the table that we provided in this presentation deck and it does indicates roughly a 60 million reduction from what we were looking at before. So that would directionally take that tailwind in 2019 from 400, call that 340. Given the fact that we still don’t know what the final discount rates and asset returns will be so call it in a range and say tailwind of 330 to 340 is probably a safe place to think about it. And kind thinking about it going into 2020 and we talk about the fact that we are positioning ourselves with putting out pension plans to a point where we're close to fully funded so that puts us in a place where the need and the demand for higher contribution is not as significant as it has been in the past. That nuance really puts us in a place where you don't have to really concern ourselves with the big contributions and that in turn keeps the CAS recoveries lower but at the same time with lower CAS recoveries to Mike's point earlier puts us in a place of affordability. So that's really what we focus on and I think that's kind of where we see ourselves.
Mike Petters: And to your point in your question, you alluded to it is our intention to come off of the CapEx spending on schedule.
Jon Raviv: Got it and as a follow up on that CAS point, in your news point you have $247 million of CAS recoveries over CAS contributions. I understand the contribution requirement goes down could you speak to when the CAS piece goes down and the shape of the product CAS piece goes down, given the pension strategy.
Mike Petters: So the CAS recoveries that we talked in the past that things will naturally gravitate towards kind of the zero. We really haven't talked specifically about the timing of that but as you can imagine there is a reduction that you can expect we'll give the specific number on the Q4 call, so stand by.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is now open.
Myles Walton: Mike I was hoping you could comment on this status of providing that evidence to the Navy so provide Congress for the savings of the block buy and kind of what the timeline is that you expect and what the hurdle of savings that you have to signup for or the Navy will have to see and provide evidence to support for you to get the go ahead.
Mike Petters: I guess I can say that we submitted our proposal to the government several months ago and we had a very substantive and constructive dialogue working our way to closure on what that looks like as we go forward. We remain optimistic, starting with the legislative side both authorizing and appropriations we're looking forward to receiving information and we're trying to put that together. I would say that’s more of a long near-term than long-term issue because in order to get the savings that we're talking about we need to get this done. But given that we're into pretty steady conversation, I don’t think I want to predict timeline at this point, I’m just going to say were working really hard to do this as soon as we can.
Myles Walton: And Dwayne you mentioned that the center cost referred work or after market work that you’re doing that you don't see as a necessary ongoing for multiple years. So what's the size of that contribution this year and what's the kind of headwinds for next year and is that pretty attractive margins relative to the base business.
Dwayne Blake: Those availabilities on average Myles can run 200 million to 300 million run to 18 to 36 months on average. So you basically got three of them going on right now and so as I mentioned you will start to see the first of those kind of peel off in the middle part of next year. So we see that a little bit of a nothing substantial and at the same time, the Navy as they are continuing to make their push to increase the efforts on the modernization side of it is always opportunities on that front, so the team is certainly engaged on that front, and we’re prepared to support the navy if they have the availability that may need to come our way.
Mike Petters: Let me just add, this falls into the whole readiness discussion that has been ongoing between the Pentagon and the services and the Congress and the issue from the industry standpoint is if you create a team that is capable of doing the work the feast or famine nature of this in the past has really had a pretty negative impact on the ability to efficiently achieve the readiness targets that you want. So our engagement today is not only in the work that we're doing to support the Navy's requirements for 2018 and 2019, but as also we are in discussion with the Navy along with the rest of the industry about how can you more efficiently support the readiness of the platforms that are out there whether they be surface ships or submarines. And so let’s see how that all works out at this point there is we are only at the discussion phase but my personal view is that what we then do and doesn’t really support the fleet that well what we as a team have been doing doesn’t support the fleet that well and as a team we've got to come to a better solution and we stand ready to help do that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Carter Copeland: I'm wondering if you can just expand a little bit on that on Myles' question on the repair and mod work and you have to strengthen that in the last few quarters but you didn’t explicitly mention it in the release so the slides there just wondering if the growth there is that sort of leveling off that's first question and then second one just so we make sure we cover all the accounting questions in addition to pension Dwayne can you give us the growth favorable and unfavorable EACs and just maybe some color around which segment they applied more to.
Dwayne Blake: So I'll take the second one first. So the team adjustments net 34, 61 positive, 27 negative no material negative adjustments and the split was roughly 85 and Ingalls shifting Newport News.
Carter Copeland: Awesome.
Mike Petters: And relative to the repair activity beyond some of what's driving that is the work we're doing in the refueling overhaul, and we're at that phase of putting the ship back together and so trying to get the delivery condition or the ship sorted out and so that's kind of the phase that we are in these are somewhat sequential you are planning the next one while you are kind of running to the end of this one and then you'll start on the follow-up when the ship leaves and so that's kind of there's a little bit of a cycle to that refueling business that you are seeing in the numbers this time too.
Dwayne Blake: And then as it relates to the availability as again the pace that they are on they are kind of in the steady state now with the those that are actively working at Newport News and so I think all three of them are kind of in the I guess in the steady state mode if you will and as I mentioned you are start to see the first of those kind of peel off about middle towards the end of next year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Two questions, one for you Mike and one for Dwayne. For Dwayne I'm estimating the workers comp that's facing expense in the quarter was about 15 day, and if you could explain where that came from. And then for you Mike, if you do get approval for the second carrier when do you need to get the money in the budget because the budget this year was kind of funny it said yeah maybe we will give you a approval but didn’t put any money in for it?
Dwayne Blake: So your first question on the workers comp it was actually 43 million and it's basically a function of re-measurement of our workers comp liabilities that they do have periodically to look in that historical trends in terms of medical expenses and just Worker's Comp experience as well as discount rate. So something that is done periodically and that is the 43 million that I called in my remarks.
Mike Petters: And George relative to the question about the funding, relative to the shipbuilder portion of the carrier construction acquisition when we look at not just the next year funding but the five year plan for funding for aircraft carriers, it was our view that you could reapportion that funding between the two ships and actually generate savings and that you wouldn't need to actually add any funding to make that happen and that really was the tipping point where you could say look if you already programmed the money for a ship if you actually just allow us to do two ships instead of one you don’t need to add any more money to the budget. You just need to get the authorization done we can proceed and actually generate savings. That's actually why, if we had to go and put more money in the budget to actually acquire the two ship. I would say that I will be a little less optimistic about the possibility of getting it done. But the fact that we can actually reprogram the money between the two ships to generate savings became a very exciting prospect for everybody we talked to, so its just a matter to definatizing it.
George Shapiro: And just a quick follow-up for you Mike, you been saying 3% to 5% revenue growth this year you’re up 10% year to date and it looks like you got pretty much approved everything you said you hoped for in the '19 budget so you're willing to up that number.
Mike Petters: Actually George to correct you, I’ve only said three, I never said 3 to 5. I’m not willing to change that because think about what's happening and on the one end we’re in a great spot that ships have been authorized and appropriated in the '18 or '19 window and it takes a lot of the uncertainty about '20 and '21 out of our business. As I said before, if you're going to sustain this the level of shipbuilding the SEN account for the last couple of years with Colombia on the horizon with frigates on the horizon with the LHA on the horizon, the LPDs on the horizon in addition to the Flight III destroyers, the block five submarines you have to be able to sustain the level that you're at today. And you know, we've seen comments where the Pentagon is already now stopping to think about maybe we need to prepare two budgets for '20. That’s not really consequential to us, but it does indicate there's a lot of uncertainty about whether we can sustain where we are today or not and as I said before, are we looking at a long-term sustained commitment to our higher level and a higher rate or is this just the rat and the snake that's going to be good for us but it's going to we’re going to go back to our historic levels. And I think the jury's still out on that, so I'm sticking to my number.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Rob Spingarn: You just kind of touched on this with George, but Mike with regard to the potential flattening out of the budget I’m think you just mentioned two budgets, I’m thinking of the lower one, the $700 billion and the spending on Columbia, which just seems to be a very top priority and that number is rising. How do we frame the risk to the rest of your portfolio?
Mike Petters: This Rob is what we've been talking about I think I feel like I've been -- we've been talking about this for four or five years now that we've got to figure out first of all we've got to figure out sequestration we're '18 and '19 were great because we had a budget deal we go into '20 and '21 there is no budget deal everyone expects that there will be another one but you got to go do it. So sequestration is the first blanket. The second blanket then is the one that we have talked a lot about it how are you going to pay for Columbia without causing collateral effects in the account. And so you know, we manage to do that in '18 and '19 as we head into the next couple of years over, and we get ready to start construction of the lead ship. We're going to be working really hard to make sure that the affordability of the programs that might be affected works our way through. So you see efforts on the multiyear for the LPDs, the frigate competition is still out there. What happens to the option ships on the destroyer, the Congress was interested in a couple of more submarines in addition to the base contract for block 5. The question is how you are going to work all that through with the priority of getting funding for Columbia done and our view is the best thing for us to do is to stay engaged and make sure people understand the impact and consequences of any particular course of action, we comment that those discussions from a position of we're executing really well on our business, so we can tell you what the efficient way to do the work will be and we have made significant capital investment in our business to actually make us more affordable. Both of those help the argument that the sustainable higher rate of funding for shipbuilding is actually the most efficient course for the taxpayers to take. And that's the path that we're taking.
Rob Spingarn: And then with regard to the strong execution that you are talking about Mike just switching to the carrier and on CDM 79 if indeed you are ahead of schedule should we think about that as meaning that labor hours are coming in below budget or have you had to put in more labor than expected to get ahead of schedule as given your result here.
Mike Petters: So we have a pretty disciplined process around both cost variances and schedule variances that we manage down there and review the program is reviewing that daily I'm reviewing that every month. And so I think that and the earned value system that we use when we if we want to accelerate something we better make sure that it’s worth it to us, but it's not going to cost us more than would have cost us to began with or accelerate it or that there is a payback to the acceleration. And so what I really worry about in a construction program typically as we get so focused in on one particular critical path that we'll go and knock the heck out of the critical path but we will neglect some of them just more mundane volume stuff that we need to be doing and we kind of create this backlog of volume stuff that needs to be done and it pushes it to the right in the program. That's not really happening in this program right now we're basically we're making decisions about the path and the sequence and the program management teams intent to accelerate the schedule actually that's a way to reduce the risk in the program and so that's why I'm very supportive of that and very encouraged by their initiative.
Dwayne Blake: And then just to refresh were not going to know we won't know how well you've done there until you put the ship in the water which is around the year from now.
Mike Petters: About a year from now and our process is very disciplined and we've been through the process that’s not disciplined and if you lose that discipline then you’re setting yourself, may feel good in the short-term but your setting yourself up for some long-term problems. So we will know more when we put the ship in the water.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Ron Epstein: Just a couple of quick one when the, for the Colombia class, is there going to be any additional CapEx needed for that or is you kind capitalized for what you’re going to need to do in Colombia class.
Dwayne Blake: Right now the capital plan that we have supports the portion of work that we are intended to do. As my sense is that’s pretty firm but as we get closer to construction there's something that pops we will have to evaluate that but we made a pretty significant investment in the program already and we kind of like what we've done and what it means to the program.
Ron Epstein: And Mike could you just talk to there has been some discussion I think on the Hill about possibly doing second refueling of the carriers so you get some more carriers in the fleet by just refueling then yet again, what’s your sense on that, what that mean, is that an opportunity for your guys, where is that going to go?
Mike Petters: Ron, I guess my experience with these ships and we all lived through the end of life of enterprise and kind of like, I don't want to be mundane about it, but kind of like your car, there is a point where every time you take the car in it costs you a whole lot more than you thought it should and as ships get older and you take them in for maintenance that curve, that maintenance cost curve isn’t linear. It starts to accelerate and becomes a real burden for the rest of the fleet. So I would think that if you, I mean there is a whole lot of technical stuff to talk about whether you can actually really do that from a science and materials and technology standpoint, but even if you decided that you wanted to do that you better actually really understand the cost curve of just your maintenance and I would not be an advocate of that. I would argue that the better way to increase the number of carriers in the fleet is to build them more frequently and efficiently.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Krishna Sinha with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
Krishna Sinha: I got a two-part question on margins. So you know couple quarters ago you gave sort of midterm guidance for 7% to 9% margins. And I just wanted to know when you put that margin guidance out there was there a particular point in time where your mix became headwind enough headwinds to push that down towards 7% to so far you been doing much ahead of that and similarly to that you talked about some of this ad hoc work like the Los Angeles stuff or other modernization work that could come down the pipe. Was that 7% to 9% inclusive or exclusive of that ad hoc work, so meaning is there were you thinking more about the core business being 7 to 9 and then this ad hoc work being layered on top or were you factoring in some of his ad hoc work into that 7% to 9% guidance.
Mike Petters: Well, you probably give us a lot more credit than we deserve. When we look at the 7% and 9% we were coming off of our perspective that if you have a healthy balance in the business between new work and mature work you ought to be operating in the 9% to 10% range. And our outlook we couldn’t see all of the different pieces and we couldn’t see all of the different timing but what we could see was and still see frankly with the now that we've kind of come through an appropriations bill for '19, what we could see as that we are going to be very heavily weighted towards new work. If you just think about what we could be doing here, starting with the destroyers in this past quarter, the work for the destroyers but then follow that up with a contract for two carriers than a contract for block 5 and submarines, the backlog is going to go up pretty significantly, and that's going to create a significant amount of new work which we just felt that it was really important for you to understand that was going to push 9% to 10% balance out of balance. It's healthy and positive for the business because it's work were capturing but it's going to push us out of balance and you should not expect that we would be in 9% to 10% range as we work our way through that. Now we don’t have this stuff under contract yet so the timing of when we start to phase out of that and get to a place where we're retiring the risk in a way that gets us back in the zone is something that we keep looking to and I think that the fact that we have been able to perform in this arena even with that kind of balance starting to shift I think that actually speaks well of the folks in the ship yards that are executing. But it's on them that we've actually done better than we might have thought we were set up to do, so I'm proud of the team, I'm proud of what we're doing but I think that you just got to keep your eyes open. A two carrier contract is going to completely weigh down the front end of the balance beam, so that's kind of the way we're thinking about it.
Dwayne Blake: Let me just add too on the front end Krishna when you look at where we are this year for ship building and with the reported number is kind of a big number at 10.7% for ship building but when you take out the kind of the one timers and it's kind of puts you back towards like 8.4% for the quarter and even year-to-date is at 8.4% so when we talk about the 7% to 9% it's kind of work it's relatively kind of in the middle of their sweet spot.
Krishna Sinha: And then just again on ad hoc work do you have any sense you talked about Los Angeles and you talked about maybe some other modernization type work in the wings but you could see coming down the pipe do you have any sense of the size of those opportunities and the timing of when that would come through and not like in terms of a quarter or but maybe in terms of years when that would come through.
Mike Petters: Yes, I think it's frankly it's too early to tell. It kind of depends on how the navy comes through its discussion about how to improve its stability to get the fleet ready and what our role in that's going to be and it's just not mature enough to be able to make any predictions on it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Finbar Sheehy with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Finbar Sheehy: You've talked about returning essentially all the free cash flow back to the shareholders and you been doing it primarily through repurchases. But you also said you plan to increase dividends at least 10% annually and can you give us any thoughts on how you're thinking about ultimately dividing the path between dividends and repurchases is there for example, a long-term dividend payout ratio you want to get to or split between repurchases and dividends.
Dwayne Blake: So Finbar when you look at the commitments and we talked about the fact that we would have at least a 10% increase on the dividend, which we've done and then the share repurchases will be opportunistic. So we continue to take advantage of opportunistic repurchases so we don't really have any set targets that we're shooting towards in terms of a payout dividend or anything of that nature. But you know suffice to say we'll be focused on continuing the commitment on the dividend increase and being opportunistic on the share repost.
Finbar Sheehy: And just on Q4 some of these ACs, are there significant risk reserve events coming up that you expect to be positive or negative in the quarter.
Dwayne Blake: So for the second half we don't have any additional ship deliveries, we had NSC 7 that delivered in Q3, as Mike mentioned DDG 117 is preparing for trial in Q4. So that's pretty much it for this year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Gautam Khanna: You may have covered this I apologize joined late but just to be clear Chris on cash flow, I know you haven’t officially guided it but next year previously we were thinking 750 is it now the delta is just the lower pension recovery is that right.
Dwayne Blake: And guess you weren't on the front end of the call, I’m Chris today. So I talked about the fact that change in the net CAS cash roughly 60 million and then also mention the fact that we still don’t know what the final discount rates and returns will be so that could put some additional variance in the number so use kind of a 330 to 340 tailwind versus the 400 that we been talking about before we would be pushing the safe spot.
Gautam Khanna: And then in CapEx just to be clear, should we assume that 2019 is relatively flat with '18 and so 2020 drops about 200 million to get 1.8.
Dwayne Blake: That gives you to the number we been talking about. So yes its fair way to think about it.
Gautam Khanna: And just any update on icebreaker some of the longer-term pursuits that you guys have talked about any update on where those things stand today.
Mike Petters: I mean you can read about those programs are proceeding at pace whether it’s the icebreaker or the frigate we're engaged in both of those programs and we're engaged with those customers and we keep moving ahead at their pace.
Gautam Khanna: The pace on the icebreaker seems to be slowing. Is that fair or what do you expect this actually ultimately get done.
Mike Petters: That’s a good question, I’m kind of the mind that they still have to kind of reconcile how much they want to spend with what they want to buy. And so I think you see that sort of whenever programs it's not just the icebreaker, whatever program has a huge appetite for what it wants to buy but doesn’t have a huge budget it takes a little bit longer to get it get that sorted out because you have to kind of go through and figure out what's important to you. And so I think that's kind of where they are.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Joseph DeNardi: Mike, it surprised me a little bit that you called out lower CBN 79 sales in the quarter was that just an anomaly or have sales kind of peaked on that contract at this point.
Dwayne Blake: I guess comparatively speaking Joe it's Dwayne, so the timing maybe a bit of a nuance but I think when you look at where 79 is the team is marching full steam ahead towards launch so in terms of how the actual volume compares quarter-over-quarter can vary but it's not slowing them down at all in terms of where they are focused.
Joseph DeNardi: And then Mike just want to make sure I understand what you are trying to communicate, I guess on the pension commentary was the message that we should kind of temper expectations from a cash flow standpoint or if there's margin upside as you realize the cost savings of that strategy.
Mike Petters: Well, I will tread gingerly here and just suggest that we were given the opportunity several years ago with everybody in the industry we were given the opportunity to make some choices that would free up cash in the near term for -- related to pension that would then create a longer tail in terms of recoveries. We chose not to do that because we already had figured that how to allocate our capital and as we were our focus in this businesses is to continue to make our businesses more competitive and our products more affordable. And so by making that choice I think we were a bit of an outlier, but we are in a place today where that choice is something that is pretty evident that we made that. So as we work our way through how we describe impact of pension for the next year and CAS recoveries for next year and the year after, I'm pretty happy with where we are because I think we are in a much more competitive position and I think our products are going to be more affordable and in an environment where every dollar in the budget is a knife fight that's not a bad place for us to be.
Operator: We do have a follow-up question from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Your line is now open.
JonRaviv: Just going back to Krishna's question about the margin, 7% to 9% certainly appreciate that you are the midpoint year-to-date with all of this new stuff picking up should we expect that to go down in 2019. And then potentially recover once we get CBN in the water late next year or is it 7% to 9% perhaps apply a little bit beyond '19 as well.
Dwayne Blake: Yes, so we've again the 7% and 9% range was the '18 and '19 get phenomenon margins back in the sweet spot as Mike mentioned on 2020 to 2021 timeframe so that remains our drives the fact that we are doing a little bit better, thus far certainly is certainly a positive phenomenon but we are still going to keep that 7% to 9% range out there for the current view of the world.
Mike Petters: And the lumpiness of the business, I’m not going to try to handicap you know quarter by quarter we are typically not very good at that.
Operator: Thank you. We have a follow-up question from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Can you just tell us what is the learning curve that you now running on the Kennedy versus the Navy's always been skeptical that you could achieve it given their history of what second ships are.
Mike Petters: So in the history I think GAO did a report and pointed out that the best man hour reduction from one ship to the next in the carrier program was like 9% or something like that, you know, which is that’s an interesting benchmark. Our performance today is 15% or in some places better than that. So I’m very pleased with what's going on there and very happy with the way the team is looking for ways to continue to create value for customers and shareholders.
George Shapiro: And if you looked at this say over the six months so is that 15% improved, stayed about the same.
Mike Petters: Without getting too technical, it's been about the same, it's been a pretty steady rate.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Petters for closing remarks.
Mike Petters: Thank you and thanks to all of you for your interest in Huntington Ingalls and for joining us today. Appreciate your perseverance as we muddled through without Chris and we hope Chris will feel better going forward. My hope anyway is also that you can see that over time all of the strategies that we have are designed to make our products make our businesses more competitive and make our products more affordable. I think you can see that whether it's in our capital improvement programs, our digital strategies, our transformation initiatives, our engagement opportunities all of that is designed to improve that experience for our customers. And so we think that's the best way for this business to create value. We believe that we are on track for that and we appreciate the time you put in this to working with us and we forward to seeing you soon. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-08-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Brendan. Good morning. And welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries' second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President of Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that not historical facts, are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also, in the remarks today, Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation, as well as our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on the call today. This morning we released second quarter 2018 financial results that reflects solid performance across all three business segments. So let me share some highlights starting on slide three of the presentation. Sales of $2 billion for the quarter were 8.7% higher than the second quarter of 2017, diluted EPS was $5.40 and included the benefit of a claim for prior year research and development tax credits and Chris will provide some additional color on taxes during his remarks. We received approximately $1.1 billion in new contract awards during the quarter resulting in a backlog of approximately $21 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $15 billion is funded. Regarding activities in Washington both the House and Senate recently passed the 29 National Defense Authorization Conference Agreement and the bill is now ready for the President's signature. We are very encouraged by the support for Navy shipbuilding in the final measure, which includes the following: it authorizes the purchase of a four forward class aircraft carriers CVN81. It supports the purchase of CVN 80 and 81 under single contract if anticipated savings can be confirmed and it supports advance procurement for LPD Flight II amphibious warships to leverage high production lines and supply chains. We're also pleased with the progress of the Defense Appropriations Bills in each chamber, but also very supportive of navy shipbuilding and we remain hopeful that the appropriations process will continue to proceed expeditiously. Now I'll provide a few points of interest on our business segments. At Ingalls the team is continuing to drive DDG-117 the Paul Ignatius, NSC-7 Kimball and LHA-7 Tripoli toward completion with trials and deliveries for these ships expected to stay in the fourth quarter and first half of next year. On the LPD program LPD-28 Fort Lauderdale reached 25% vessel complete during the quarter and is performing well on both costs and schedule. On the DEG program the team has started fabrication on DDG 125 the Jack H. Lucas this is the first Fight III three ship that incorporates a new air and missile defense radar system and Ingalls also recently launched DDG 121 Frank E. Petersen Jr. At Newport News CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 47% complete overall and 81% structurally complete with 361 of 448 lifts joined together in the dry dock. At this stage of construction the team is focused on efficient execution of each super lift and that includes increased levels of pre-Operator [ph] fitting work. Importantly we are seeing the benefits from these actions and from the capital investments in covered workspaces on the assembly platen, I am very pleased with the progress on this ship. There's still a lot of hard work ahead of us but, the team is meeting our performance expectations and is continuing to drive toward an earlier launch of the ship at the end of next year. On the submarine program SSN 789 Indiana delivered to the navy at the end of June and SSN 791 Delaware the final Block III boat to be delivered by Newport News is on track to deliver in the first half of next year. Now turning to technical solutions, we continue to realize the benefits of having a business segment that is focused on non-ship building activities, but has reached back to our entire portfolio of capabilities. For example in just the past 15 months we have significantly expanded our Department of Energy portfolio, previously concentrated at the Savannah River site. The portfolio now includes contracts for managing the Nevada National Security site, the remediation of certain areas of the Los Alamos National Laboratory site and the management and operation of the Los Alamos site. At each of these sites whether we are the lead, minority partner or significant subcontractor we bring an unmatched level of nuclear expertise and complex project management skills to the team and we are proud to be a trusted partner of our DOE customer. In unmanned systems we continue to strengthen our partnership with following during the design phase of XLUUV the navy's flagship UUV program, a down select and initial prototype production contract award is expected early next year. Additionally, we were one of several companies that recently received a contract to support research and development activities for the Navy's UUV family of systems. And finally in the oil and gas business we have seen a rebound in project activity in the United States and Canada that is driving increased hiring in both markets. As a result of our strong project execution and an unrelenting commitment to customer success we are well positioned to take advantage of improving energy market conditions and are doing just that. In closing we've had a very solid first half of the year and look forward to maintaining this momentum in the second half. Our path to 2020 strategy is on track, and our near-term focus remains on executing existing contract work and capturing quality new contracts. These actions, combined with our well trained and engaged work force, keep us on a path to continue creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. Now that concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Christopher Kastner: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. As I review our second quarter financial results and provide a few updates to the full year, you may follow along with the slide presentation we included with our earnings release this morning. Beginning with our consolidated results on slide four of the presentation. Our second quarter revenue growth was particularly strong as this marks the first time since we spun that we generated revenues in excess of $2 billion in a given quarter. Revenues in the quarter of $2 billion increased 8.7% over second quarter 2017, driven by higher volumes in aircraft carriers and Navy nuclear support services in Newport News. Operating income in the quarter of $257 million increased $16 million or 6.6% from second quarter 2017. The increase was primarily driven by favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment in the quarter compared to d same period of 2017, partially offset by lower segment operating income. Operating margin in the quarter was 12.7%. Turning to slide five of the presentation, cash from operations was $239 million in the quarter after contributing $60 million to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans, of which $50 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified plans. Year-to-date, we have contributed $84 million to our qualified plans. And as discussed previously, we expect to make a total of $508 million in discretionary contributions to our qualified plans of 2018, with the balance occurring in the third quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was $154 million. Net capital expenditures in the quarter were $85 million or 4.2% of revenues compared to $79 million in the same period of 2017. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be between 5% and 6% of revenues. We returned almost $280 million to our shareholders in the quarter by repurchasing approximately 1.1 million shares at a cost of $247 million and paying $32 million in dividends, bringing our cash balance at the end of the quarter to $398 million. Now the segment results on slide six of the presentation. Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $629 million decreased 1.6% from the same period last year, driven by decreased volumes on the NSE program and surface combatants, partially offset by increased volume on the LPD program. Ingalls' operating income of $83 million and margin of 13.2% in the quarter were down $15 million and 214 basis points year-over-year respectively, mainly due to lower risk retirement on LHA 7 and the NSE program, partially offset by higher risk retirement on the LPD and DDG programs and $12 million of income from recoveries related to a settlement involving a legacy commercial contract. Turning to slide seven of the presentation, Newport News revenues were approximately $1.2 billion in the quarter, increased 18.2% from the same period last year, mostly due to higher volumes in aircraft carriers and Navy nuclear support services. Newport News operating income of $91 million in the quarter was up $11 million year-over-year, primarily because of higher revenues. Newport News operating margin in the quarter of 7.7% was 30 basis points lower than the same period last year, primarily due to changes in contract mix. Now to Technical Solutions on slide eight of the presentation, Technical Solutions revenues of $243 million in the quarter were relatively flat to revenues in second quarter 2017. Technical Solutions operating income of $7 million and margin of 2.9% in the quarter decreased $2 million and 81 basis points year-over-year respectively, primarily because of lower performance in fleet support services. Before I turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A, let me address our lower than expected effective federal income tax rate for the quarter and the expectation for the full year. Our effective federal income tax rate for the quarter of 8.8% deferred from the statutory rate because of the claim for higher research and development tax credits for the post spin-off 2011 through 2015 tax years. We now expect our 2018 effective income tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow up so we can get as many people in the queue as possible. Brendan, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A. Brendan?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is open.
Doug Harned: Thank you. Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Harned: I wanted to get a little better understanding of the margin profile at Newport News. And particularly when you look at CVN 79, can you give us a sense of the risk profile on that program? In other words, if things go according to - just according to plan, do you foresee next year that we could see some improvement in margins at Newport news?
Mike Petters: Doug, we've talked about this before, really the next major event on 79 from a risk while we do quarterly EACs, our risk-retirement milestone is going to be launched. And the nominal schedule for launch is the beginning of 2020, but the team is pushing hard to get the launch done in the fall of next year. And at this time, we seem to be on track for that and we're happy about that. But we're probably not going to do any sort of major risk reassessment between now and launch.
Doug Harned: Okay. So if I think of Newport News more broadly. I mean, you're well into Block IV on Virginia Class. I'm just trying to understand if we should start to see some potential for margin improvement there as Block IV matures. And if you - and would think, if you get launch early on CVN 79 that would also be some potential for upside. I'm just trying to understand what levers are there?
Christopher Kastner: No, Doug, it's Chris. That's a really good point, Block IV will be maturing 73 will be maturing as well. So along with 79 you have both of those programs maturing. But we are still pretty comfortable with the 7% to 9% return on sales. It could fluctuate some quarters, but we are comfortable with the 7% to 9% for shipbuilding.
Doug Harned: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Carter Copeland: Good morning, gentlemen.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Carter Copeland: Just a couple of quick ones. One, Chris, can you clarify for us the gross favorable unfavorable cumulative. And then Mike, I just wondered if with the NDA supportive of many of the things that you've been looking for. How does that play into your updated thoughts around timing on contracting of some of these opportunities? How far out will that take us, now that you've got some very clear support for what you've been looking for?
Christopher Kastner: Sure, I'll take the adjustments first and then I'll kick it over to Mike. There were $50 million of positive adjustments, 13 negative for net 37. 70% of that net was Ingalls.
Carter Copeland: Thanks, Chris.
Christopher Kastner: Sure.
Mike Petters: Carter on the - as far as the NDAA goes, as I mentioned, we're very encouraged and pleased with the way that Bill came out. And we look forward to the President finally signing that Bill. There is still an appropriations process that has to work through self through. I think I said before, this is the most exciting time that I've seen in shipbuilding in 30 years. And if you step back and just look at what we're doing right now. We actually have an offer into the Navy to build two aircraft carriers. Our team has an offer into the Navy to build 10 submarines. And we are in a competition for our share of 10 destroyers and that's right now their support for multi-year procurement of LPDs. So we're all very encouraged by all of this. But the way the nation makes its decisions to go and actually execute these requires both authorizations and appropriations where we're engaged in the appropriations process, but we are not through that process yet. And so, we're at a place where all the things that need to be happening or happening, but we are not across the goal line. And have been around long enough to know that you don't get points until you get across the goal line. So, as far as the longer term view, I do think that we're going to - I am encouraged to things that we're going to be able to get contracts for all of these of ships over the next year to 18 months and get that done and that's going to set the shipbuilding piece of our business up for the next 5 to 10 years and I am very encouraged about that. But we're not done yet and before we look at the scoreboard, we're going to keep trying to get first balance.
Doug Harned: I like it. Thanks Mike.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Yes, I wanted to know Mike for the first half for the year now you have had 7% revenue growth and you were suggesting more like 3% over next several years. You want to change that estimate or what's going on here and do you expect this kind of growth in the second half?
Mike Petters: Yes, George, I think that we talked about the 3%, we talked about it over several year period. Yes, we've had a couple of good quarters, but we're comfortable with our 3% estimate over a longer timeframe.
Christopher Kastner: George, this is Chris. I may add we've three submarines in Newport News right now in availabilities. That's really not work that is consistent over the long-term, it'll be lumpy overtime. But we are still comfortable with a 3% CAGR at this point.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then Chris just a follow-up, you had said before that at Ingalls, we would see probably lower margins later on in the year as we see more new ships coming, starting, so you'll have less EACs, is that still an accurate statement?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, I think overtime what we've said is that, as we get new ships at Ingalls, there should be less opportunity for the higher margins, as they have had over last couple of years. I still think we're comfortable with the 7% to 9% return on sales for shipbuilding.
George Shapiro: Okay, thanks.
Christopher Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Raviv of Citi. Your line is now open.
Jonathan Raviv: Thank you. On free cash flow for this year, Chris can you just revisit some of the targets you have intimated for the year, I think $100 million down year-on-year, which would imply $350 million in 2018. And then what are the building blocks on the 2019 beyond the mechanical $400 million year-on-year swing from pension?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, we don't provide free cash flow guidance, but I had discussed $100 million of pressure to where we finished last year and we finished last year around $450 million. And then just the significant swing based on our accelerated pension contribution, net pension cash of about $400 million in 2019. There are other puts and takes that will go into 2019 cash and we're coming to our plan now. So as things evolve through the year and when we get into the year-end call I'll be able to provide you more color.
Jonathan Raviv: And then sort of related to that question on sustainable almost like taking out sustainable cash flow, obviously the net pension inflow is pretty significant right now. When that starts shrinking is due to pension mechanics is there anything you can do to fill that hole, so to speak?
Christopher Kastner: Well, don't necessarily think of it as a hole, right. The major swings for cash for us right now are our capital program, which we think makes great sense that is $1.8 billion through 2020. And then pension driven by CAS cash and FAS, so overtime as we become more fully funded, all FAS/CAS and cash should come down. We provided the information where we directionally think that is in 2018 and 2019, we'll come through the plan and we'll provide you additional guidance or additional direction for 2019 and 2020 for pension. So there is not a lot of moving parts, when you think about cash and shipbuilding, it's really capital net pension and working capital and working capital is fairly consistent. So, we really don't think of it as a hole we need to fill, it's just a normal operation of the business.
Jonathan Raviv: Understood. Thank you, Chris.
Christopher Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is now open.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Sam Pearlstein: I wanted to go back on the 3% outlook that you have. Because you mentioned this is for the sales growth, you mentioned a couple of different competitions or things that are out there. And I guess trying to just think about how the things like the frigate and icebreaker in terms of how those break or how we buy the DDG 51 Flight IIIs in terms of the split. How do you think about those and their profile in that longer term growth rate?
Christopher Kastner: It's a good question. The 3% CAGR is really a risk adjusted viewpoint on how things could evolve between now and 2022. If things fall perfectly, it could be more than that, but it's really a risk adjusted look at shipbuilding revenue taking into consideration all of those competitions and all of those programs.
Sam Pearlstein: And Mike, the Flight III competition, is this similar to prior ones or where you might have the loser get some of the winners' price. Should we expect a 50-50 split? Anything different about this competition versus other ones we've seen in the destroyers?
Mike Petters: Yes, I think in the main it's - I'd say it's in the same box, but it's in the different part of the box. Because I think the Navy came to this solicitation this is my perspective, but they came to - this time around they came with a view that they're trying to figure out how to get quantity as well as value out of this Block by considering that it's also is a radar upgrade. And so we actually had to price several different scenarios of schedules and quantities of ships complementary between our yard and our competitor's yard. And I can't speak to the Navy's evaluation process, but I think they were looking at all of those different scenarios and trying to figure out how to optimize their return. For us, it created a circumstance in the proposal that basically if you want the ships faster, there is an opportunity to do that. And so it's just going to be interesting to see how this all turns out on the backend. But I think where we're going to be like I said we're going be in the same box, but I think this is going to be a case where the industrial base is trying to support the Navy from a quantity standpoint. And I think that's going to be pretty good, however it turns out. And it's going to be pretty good for at least for us. It's going to be pretty good no matter how it turns out.
Sam Pearlstein: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna, Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Gautam Khanna: Thank you, good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Gautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could give us any flavor on the gross unfavorable cumulative catch ups year-to-date whatever it is, $37 million. Is that skewed to NNS and how is that mix changed if you look kind of first half versus first half of last year?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, this is year I don't believe there was anything materially that we would address. And I don't have the specific cumulative adjustments for the first six months of the year last year versus this year in front of me. Gautam I could walk you through that later today if you like.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. No that would be helpful. I'm just trying to get at on CVM 79 have you - are you sort of on plan with the cost estimates over the last couple of quarters. Or is that been a source of gross unfavorable?
Christopher Kastner: No, we're comfortable with where we are on 79.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. Chris, I was hoping if you could give us some directional color perhaps even the floor on where the pension trends FAS/CAS recovery beyond 2019. I mean, what sort of - you're giving guidance on a CapEx it appears that it would drop something like $200 million in 2020 based on your five year plan. Do you have any sort of lower bound on pension recovery that you can give us so we have some framework (inaudible) outcomes?
Christopher Kastner: Gautam, I don't right now. We're going through our planning process and I'll be able to update our analysis for pension for both 2019 and 2020 and provide that to you on the year-end call.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And just last one, based on the deliveries you are forecasting Q3 and Q4, should we expect that Newport's margin this quarter is sort of a high watermark for the year or do you have any sort of color you can give us on sort of the sequential cadence of margin at MMS?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, Gautam, we don't - as you know, we don't provide margin guidance. What we have said, is it will be 7% to 9% return on sales in shipbuilding for the next two years.
Gautam Khanna: All right. Thank you. I thought I'd try.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Sir, your line is open.
David Strauss: Thanks. Wanted to ask about cash return, so far year-to-date you've had a heavy amount of share repurchase, you've got the pension fund coming due in - or your plan on doing that in Q3. How should we think about from here are you going to increase debt or raise debt to fund the pension given where you stand today and how should we think about share repurchase through the rest of the year? Thanks.
Mike Petters: Yes, share repurchase is an essential part of our strategy that we kicked off in 2015 where first we invest in our shipyards, n we're investing $1.8 billion in our shipyards through 2020. And then returning substantially all free cash flow back to shareholders. What we did in Q2 is consistent with that strategy and we're going to continue to execute it. Relative to raising debt, we don't necessarily need to do that for our pension contribution in Q3, we have our cash balance of I think $398 million and we have a $1.3 billion revolver. So, we have a strong balance sheet that we can deal with that.
David Strauss: Okay. And a follow-up on TS, I think in the past you said you've targeted that business as a 5% margin business in the 2020 timeframe. How does Nevada and Los Alamos kind of change - potentially change that story?
Christopher Kastner: It's all part of that story. It's an essential part of the strategy within TS was to be successful in the DOE space, team has done an excellent job there. I think Mike's done two of the facilities here. So, if he wants to comment on it.
Mike Petters: Yes, I would just - as Chris said, this is an essential part of our TS strategy. And I would kind of offer that in my over 30 years in the business. I have watched this over 30 years try to chase down some of this business with really only one success and that was at Savannah River. At the end of 2016, we reorganized the business and we created a separate division and we created and established new leadership lines. And we became much more focused on going after that business. And since that time, we have become - we're on the team at the Nevada test site. We are subcontractor to the team at Los Alamos on the M&O contract. And we're the prime for the Los Alamos legacy clean-up. So, in basically 18 months we've won three awards where after 30 years we had only won one. So, I am excited about where we're going with that business. And as I said, and Chris has said, it's an essential part of where the TS business profile is going to go, not just over the next couple of years, but really over the next several decades. We're a principle partner now with Department of Energy and we're proud to be there and very supportive.
David Strauss: Thanks for taking my questions.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Christopher Kastner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Ronald Epstein: Hey, good morning, guys.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning, Ron.
Ronald Epstein: Maybe two questions, back to the revenue growth assumption of 3%, Mike, for your comments if some of that stuff that is being talked about potentially a two carrier block and the 10 submarines so on and so forth. And it being in your words the best environment you've seen in 30 years it's hard to believe that's a 3% growth environment if any of that actually comes through?
Mike Petters: Yes, like as Chris said Ron this is the 3% is kind of risk adjusted. We're not home on the two carriers, we're encouraged but we're not there. On the submarine business the 10 ship Block V contract is one we're working on. Congress is considering adding a couple of ships to that, but not sure how that's going to play out. The destroyer business is 10 ship competition so there's share of 10 ships with an option for five more, not really sure how that's going to play out. There's desire to go to multi-years on the LPD, the LXR program, the LPD Flight II, but we're not at that point yet either. And the frigate competition is in end of next year RFP and maybe a 2020 award so we're really way up in front of that. And so our view of it is as that, Chris said if all of those things break our way it's definitely more than 3%, but as we step back and handicap where we think that things are going to go with some confidence from a risk standpoint we think 3% is a good number to work from right now. If some of these things start to break our way and we see a different number and see it and make an adjustment we'd be happy to let you know.
Ronald Epstein: Okay, yes, fair enough. And then maybe another question when we were down visiting the shipyard a little while back and walk around CVN 79 and seeing all the super lifts and what's going on with that ship. Can you maybe just talk to everyone on about some of the lessons learned you guys have had on that ship that you can apply to CVN 80 in terms of efficiency. So as we think about the transition to the next carrier how we could maybe see maybe more margin stability or even potentially margin uplift?
Mike Petters: Sure, you saw it when you were here, we have made pretty significant capital investment to reduce the cost of 79 and we targeted a pretty significant man hour reduction just in the labor side of that contract between 78 and 79 we see opportunity to continue to advance those reductions when you go to 80 and 81. Especially if you happen to have it in a two ship contract where you're able to just have the teams move from doing the work on 80 and going right over and doing the work on 81. Shift gears if you're able to do that inside of the shipyard you ought to be able to do that in the supply chain as well and approaching the market and approaching our suppliers and talking to them about buying two ships that's worth the material as oppose to one should create some efficiencies for us there. And then, as we go through and I think Ron when you were here we talked with you all like we've talked with everybody about the digital transformation that's going on in Newport News and how you bring the technologies that are out there to bear on this pretty complex manufacturing enterprise, we believe there's opportunities there as well. And the real push for the two carrier contract is to create that stable floor so that we can then go and prosecute all of those efficiencies and opportunities. So as I keep saying we're very encouraged about where we are today. If we had - if you were able to do us time lapse and say a year ago today we were preparing a one ship proposal for the Navy for CVN 80. Today we have a proposal into the Navy for CVN 80 and 81 and we are seeing and encouraged by a lot of broad support both inside the Navy and across river and the Congress for proceeding down that path. We think that sets the foundation for affordably producing and delivering aircraft carriers in the future and we're really excited about what that means for us.
Ronald Epstein: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Krishna Sinha of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
Krishna Sinha: Hi, thanks for taking the question. On the Indiana 789, given that you delivered in the quarter and you completed sea trials. I would have expected a little bit of more of a risk reserve to be taken this quarter. Is that something that's still yet to be booked, is that like a 3Q event, or did you take most of the risk reserve on that at launch at an earlier date?
Christopher Kastner: Well, thanks for question Krishna and welcome. We assess issues on a quarterly basis, we have adjusted those previously on the Indiana. I don't anticipate material adjustments related to that, that both going forward, and I still believe that 7% to 9% is the right way to think about the business over the next couple of years.
Krishna Sinha: Yes. And then on future sort of risk events, - risk reserve events, EAC events. Can you just talk about - I think that the 789 was the major launch this year, are there any other milestones, major milestones on other programs that we should be aware of in 3Q and 4Q?
Mike Petters: We do had delivery of NSC 7 this year and then we're moving down the path on delivery of the other two boats, DDG 117 and LHA 7 towards the back half of this year, the first half of next year. And then we have incremental milestones on a number of ships that we'll assess on a quarterly basis.
Krishna Sinha: Are the EAC adjustments typically in looking at a single program, when are the bulk of EAC adjustment sort of taking. Are they more towards the launch date or the delivery date?
Christopher Kastner: Well, you have to assess each program and each program and each ship will have its individual risk register. So there is not a path formula that's determined for each of the milestones, it's all based on the risk register on the specific ship, on that specific program, as it runs through the manufacturing cycle.
Mike Petters: Yes, we have a pretty discipline process, where we - when we come off a contract we map all of the risk that we see to the milestones in the program. And we evaluate at each milestone, we evaluate whether we actually retired that risk or not and if not, can we continue the work to retire that risk at the next milestone or another milestone. Or do we have to actually recognize that we didn't retire that risk. Every program has its own profile, we tend to be conservative in that regard. And so I'd say - and that sort of the blend that we have been talking about for almost eight years now. That early in programs, we tend not to go and recognize risk retirement, we don't want to recognize it before we know for sure we have retired it. So, there is probably a bias towards the backend of programs, but each one has got its own profile, as Chris said.
Krishna Sinha: Yes. And then one quick one on revenues, you talked a little bit earlier about obviously the positively shipbuilding environment and the sub-committee NDA write-ups and how that's breaking your way as it stands right now. If things go to plan, even your risk adjusted plan. Is there a particular year where you'll see a surge in new builds, or is it really spread out very easy over say the next 10 years or some long period?
Mike Petters: Yes, we actually think that we're in a pretty unique position right here, because if you step back just a little bit and look at what happened in the FY 2018 process and now what's happening in the FY 2019 process, with regard to shipbuilding, there is a pretty good surge, that's why I'd say it's the most exciting time I have seen. In these two years there is a surge for ship authorizations and appropriations, each program has its own path and sequence for playing it, for win you actually go to contract for the particular ships. But the issue that I think that makes us a little bit unique in the industry is it, this two year window is really special for shipbuilding. There is a big question really about what happens out in 2020, sequestration kicks back in, what happens after that. Our view is that a lot of the work that we're going to get under contract before 2020 puts us in a pretty unique place. If you see the same kind of activity in 2020 and 2021 and follow-on, than that's just going to be even better for the business. But we're - we think that - I think I have described it before, are we going to be at a new - is this an indication of a new sustained level for the business or is this just going to be the rat and the snake where we have a lump in the business that we're going to work through over the next five to ten years. The job right now is to get the lump under contract and then we'll go figure out how do we keep it at that sustained level.
Krishna Sinha: Okay, that's great. Thank you guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Joseph DeNardi: Yes, thank you very much. Mike just on Columbia Class if you look at the work share it looks pretty similar just from our standpoint in terms of what you guys are doing in Virginia Class. So should we assume that maybe the margin profile on that business could actually be pretty good right out of the gate because there's some commonality or there are actually some aspects that would lead to it being kind of more of a normal margin curve, I know it's ways out, but just curious how you think about that?
Mike Petters: Well, I mean, the work share is a little bit different than it is on Virginia Class. We will not be delivering any of those ships whereas we deliver half of the Virginia Class programs. We will be building units and we're doing design work for those. Our scope on Virginia is about half, our scope on Columbia is less than that and we're going to be moving into a lead ship environment for ship that's really 100% new. And so for the next period of time next few years we're going to be in the design phase moving into construction. And we're going to be incredibly as supportive as we can be to make this program as much of a success from the gate - from the opening gate as we can. But I don't think you want to just turn around and say it's the same as Virginia and it's just the expansion of volume I think that would be a misread. This is a new program and I think you need to treat it as a new program.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay. And then Mike you mentioned a couple of times the risk adjusted growth you see in the business. Wondered if you could share kind of what the upper end of that range would look like if everything falls your way? And then what are some of the key risk items that you're looking at that'll determine kind of how that plays out? Thank you.
Mike Petters: Yes, I think that's completely driven by whatever assumptions you want to pick. And it could be something as simple as are there going to be any options picked up on the Destroyers or not. Is the RFP for the Frigate going to come out on time, is it going to be only one builder and they're going to make that award on time. And I think you start getting into a top line guess based on and it's driven entirely by your assumption. So I don't know that there's much value in trying to do that. Our view is that we've looked at all of that we think that right now the best way to position the business and to talk about where the business is going is that from a risk adjusted standpoint 3% seems to make sense. As I mentioned before if a couple things start to break our way and it changes our view we would be happy to describe that with you and discuss it with you.
Christopher Kastner: Also timing is very important you could have six month delay on a ship, which could impact your revenue, be very successful on acquiring a ship and building the ship, but that six month delay could impact your revenue. So the 3% is really a risk adjusted answer based on knowledge of all those factors.
Joseph DeNardi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning, Rob.
Robert Spingarn: I'm jumping in a little late so I'm going to - hopefully these haven't been asked, the first one is on for Chris on the cash flow statement there are some grant proceeds offsetting some of your CapEx. And I wanted to see if you have any color on what that relates to whether that's for Columbia or something else? And would something like this be recurring going forward and is it net or gross relative to the CapEx guidance of 5% to 6% of sales?
Christopher Kastner: Yes that…
Robert Spingarn: And Mike I have one for you.
Christopher Kastner: Well that's all included in the 5% to 6% of sale from that shipyard of the future proceeds from the State of Mississippi.
Robert Spingarn: So that's - okay so it's obviously for Ingalls programs therefore nothing to do with Columbia is it program specific or just across Ingalls?
Christopher Kastner: No across Ingalls.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then Mike on the - just wanted to ask you on the multi-year for DDG 51 what is winning this competition really mean? Do you have an indication on how the 10 ships would be split, how the priced options would be split? And then how we think about the price the loser would have to accept?
Mike Petters: Actually, I have no indication. We've submitted our offer. What was unique about the proposal was that we actually put - we actually price several scenarios and the scenarios included building more than half and building less than half of those programs. So, then the Navy will go and they will make their choice. And since we priced all of that, I think that this is one of those - it's a unique situation because I think the Navy bid per quantity on a pedestal with cost in this competition. And I think that's good for the whole industry. And we will see how it turns out.
Robert Spingarn: Does that mean it could be more than let's say 60-40, like 70-30 kind of thing or?
Mike Petters: No. I don't think it would be any more than what you've seen in the past. But I - yes, and let's just leave at that.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Last question actually on the - I just wanted to ask for your outlook on the cutter, on the Coast Guard cutter deliveries, how we should think about those since they often are strong ships from a margin perspective, what the delivery schedule looks like for the cutters?
Mike Petters: Yes, NSE 7 back half of this and NSE 8 first part of next year.
Robert Spingarn: Thank you very much.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Raviv of Citi. Your line is now open.
Jonathan Raviv: Hey, thanks for taking the follow up.
Mike Petters: Sure.
Jonathan Raviv: I will not ask about growth, but I will ask about cash deployment. And I understood that repo is an important part of this strategy where we have seen other companies in this space, defense broadly contributing more to pension, we've seen sizeable M&A. What's the current mindset on cash deployment beyond repo?
Christopher Kastner: Current posture hasn't really changed since we came in a few years ago and described it. We're going to invest in our core business. So, large capital investment that we've been - and we're in the middle of that right now. And then when you move from capital investment to the free cash, we're going to return substantially all of our free cash to shareholders in the form of either share buyback or dividends and we have a commitment to increase our dividends every year. As far as M&A goes, we believe that our balance sheet is strong enough to - if we have opportunities to take advantage of, we'd be able to do that. That's the path we've been on. That's the path we expect to be on through 2020. I think this quarter we had a little bit more share buyback than we've had in the past, but that's completely consistent with what we said back in 2015 and we're not changing that posture at this point.
Jonathan Raviv: And on M&A, if you - as you evaluate the pipeline or look at opportunities or evaluate them, are you focused more on core shipbuilding or could we see some interest in expanding the services market which u seems to be - which it appears to be going well thus far?
Mike Petters: We stand close to the core and we'd always evaluate shipbuilding opportunities. But within TS, there are markets such as unmanned underwater vehicles, [indiscernible] advanced training, agile software development, restricted work and then even environmental management in support of the DOE. So, we're going to stay close to the core and utilize a fair - a very disciplined process to evaluate those. Anything else, Jon?
Jonathan Raviv: No, no. I said thank you very much.
Christopher Kastner: You're welcome.
Mike Petters: Yes, we just didn't hear that.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I am showing no further questions and would like to turn the call back over to Mike Petters.
Mike Petters: Well, thanks everybody for joining us on the call this morning. As I mentioned, this is an exciting time for our business. Not only is it the most exciting time that we've seen in shipbuilding in 30 years, but we have feeling that growth now in our TS division that with a couple of key wins in the DOE business and our footprint in the UUV business. We really see that some of the seeds we planted a few years ago are starting to sprout. And we're very encouraged by that. And we look forward to the rest of the year and for the years to come. Thank you all very much for joining us. Bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-05-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the First Quarter 2018 Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dwayne Blake. Please go ahead, sir.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks Andrew. Good morning. And welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries’ first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President of Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that not historical facts, are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also, in the remarks today, Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our Web site. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our Web site at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation, as well as our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the all. Today, we released first quarter 2018 financial results that included revenue growth in all three of our business segments. So let me share some highlights starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $1.87 billion for the quarter were 8.7% higher than 2017. Diluted EPS was $3.48 and operating cash was $120 million for the quarter. We received approximately $2.6 billion in new contract awards during the quarter, resulting in backlog of approximately $22 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $15 billion is funded. So before getting into the discussion of our business segments, I want to talk about the current and near term shipbuilding environment. At the end of Q1 2018, we had approximately 25 ships under contract to be constructed in our facilities. By the end of 2020, if all goes as planned, we will see a significant amount of contracting activity that is expected to result in the award of base contracts or options to be exercised for 20 to 30 ships. This includes the DDG 51 multiyear procurement, VCS Block V, CVN 80 and 81, NSC 10 and 11 and LPD Flight II. At the same time as you already know, we are investing approximately $1.8 billion of capital in our facilities to improve efficiency, capacity and affordability. I have to tell you that this is the most exciting time I have seen in my 30-plus years in shipbuilding. This new work supports our sales outlook for the next five years, and forms the foundation that will support the business for the next 10 to 15 years. As the shipbuilding portfolio transitions, we are resetting the expected return on sales range. During the Q4 call, I commented that while our long-term shipbuilding return on sales target remains in the 9% to 10% range, we may fall slightly below the lower end of that range from time-to-time as we continue through the transition period on programs at Newport News and begin the transition to new programs at Ingalls. What we are experiencing now and expect to experience over the next two years is that the mix of contracts and production is a bit out of balance with more new work than normal. And this puts pressure on the blended return on sales rate. Recognizing this phenomenon, we expect the return on sales for shipbuilding to be in the 7% and 9% range for 2018 and 2019. So now, I will provide a few points of interest on our business segments. At Ingalls, the team is focused on completion of DDG 117, NSC 7 and LHA 7 in the second half of this year. At this same time, they are preparing for the future as the proposal for the next DDG 51 multiyear procurement was recently submitted to the Navy. And Ingalls began reactivating shipbuilding facilities on the east bank of the Pascagoula River. These facilities will provide additional capacity to support Ingalls’ current ship construction and modernization programs, as well as help us better prepare for future work, including next-generation amphibious assault ships and surface combatants. At Newport News, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 75% structurally complete and 43% complete overall. The team continues to produce results that are in line with our expectations, and is pushing to accelerate launch by three months to the fourth quarter of 2019. On the submarine program, SSN 789 Indiana is prepared for sea trials and delivery to the Navy in the second quarter. In addition, the team completed and shipped the final module of SSN 792 Vermont, the first Block IV boat, during the quarter. The Newport News team is also preparing for the future as they recently submitted their proposal in response to the Navy's request to provide pricing to purchase CVN 80 and CVN 81 under a two ship contract. The two ship purchase reduces the cost of aircraft carriers by stabilizing the Newport News workforce in the national supplier base, allowing the team to buy materials in quality, and sequencing construction activities more efficiently. Turing to Technical Solutions. Australia's Department of Defense awarded a contract in Naval Shipbuilding Institute, a joint venture between Technical Solutions and KBR. The JV will establish and manage the new Naval Shipbuilding College in support of Australia's mission to recapitalize its shipbuilding and maritime sustainment industry over the next 30-plus years. In closing, we are seeing the early stages of top line growth that supports our outlook for sales and shipbuilding over the next five years, and we are investing in the facilities to support this growth. Our partnership with the Navy and solid program execution allow Congress and the administration to provide stable, and in some cases, accelerated funding for programs. And finally, our work under contract plus new work on the horizon at are shipbuilding segments, coupled with key wins in our Technical Solutions segment, keep us on a path to create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. And that concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Mike and good morning. Before I discuss our first quarter results, I would like to comment on some new accounting standards that we’ve implemented. During the quarter, we adopted the new revenue recognition and pension cost presentation standards. We also implemented the recent FASB guidance resulting from tax reform on the reclassification of certain tax effects in equity. These changes are clearly identified and explained in our quarterly report. Moving on the consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter of $1.7 billion increased 8.7%, primarily due to higher volumes in aircraft carriers and navy nuclear support services at Newport News, and higher volumes in amphibious ships at Ingalls, partially offset by lower NSE program volume. Operating income in the quarter of $191 million increased $23 million or 13.7% from first quarter 2017, and operating margin of 10.2% increased 45 basis points. These increases were primarily driven by a favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment. Turning to Slide 5 of the presentation. Cash from operations was $120 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $47 million. Net capital expenditures in the quarter were $73 million or 3.9% of revenues compared to $58 million in the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, we contributed $43 million to our pension and post retirement benefit plans in the quarter, of which $34 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified plans. We also repurchased approximately 674,000 shares at a cost of $166 million, and paid dividends of $0.72 per share or $32 million, bringing our quarter end cash balance to $528 million. Before I address segment results, please note that segment operating income in the quarter included a one-time $20 million expense for bonuses paid to our employees related to tax reform. Moving on to Slide 6 of the presentation. Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $585 million increased 6.4% from the same period last year, driven by increased volume on the LPD and LHA programs, partially offset by decreased volume on the NSC program. Ingalls’ operating income of $64 million and margin of 10.9% in the quarter were down from first quarter 2017, mainly due to lower risk retirement on NSC program, partially offset by higher risk retirement on LPD program. Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation. Newport News revenues were $1.1 billion in the quarter, increased 11.4% from the same period last year, mostly due to higher volume and aircraft carrier RCOH programs and submarine support services. Newport News operating income of $51 million and margin of 4.7% in the quarter were down year-over-year, primarily because of the one-time payment of bonuses related to tax reform and changes in contract mix. Now to Technical Solutions on slide 8 of the presentation. Technical Solutions revenues of $233 million in the quarter increased 3.6% from the same period last year, mainly due to higher revenue in oil and gas and fleet support services, partially offset by lower nuclear and environmental revenue. Technical Solutions’ operating income of $2 million in the quarter increased $20 million from first quarter 2017, as a result of the $29 million reserve taken in the first quarter of 2017 against accounts receivable due from Westinghouse, partially offset by the one-time payment of bonus is related to tax reform. That concludes my remarks. I’ll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Andrew, I’ll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Doug Harned: I wanted to understand a little bit more about how you’re looking at the CapEx profile going forward. Since you announced that you’re going to reactivate the east side of the Pascagoula River, looks like that would be a big project. And so I am interested in how you’re thinking about -- how you’re going to use that. Is that tied to higher volumes or more toward how you do new models like LSR. Could you talk a little bit about that CapEx profile and how that fits in?
Mike Petters: We started this overall capital expansion well ahead of this contracting expansion that we just talked about, and so we’re actually pretty well positioned to drive the -- to reset and drive the efficiencies that we need to get these ships under contract. The specifics around the east bank are really driven by, as we look at the extra workload that the Navy has put-in in some of their competitive programs, especially on the non-nuclear ships, it becomes a capacity issue for us. And I’ll let to Chris talk about it.
Chris Kastner: The numbers -- the activation of the east bank is all included in the $1.8 billion that we previously talked about. So think about the 5% to 6% of sales that we identified this year, next year is relatively flat and it tapers down from there.
Doug Harned: So this assumes -- this is basically tied to the existing outlook for new ships more than it tied to the expectation that the volume of ships might go up in the future. I mean this would give you flexibility for that, but you would do this under any circumstances?
Mike Petters: Well, that’s interesting. I mean, I think we probably would not have done the east bank if we were in a steady state position that we ran back when we kicked off the capital program back in 2014. But what we’re seeing right now is the expansion of shipbuilding contract that we talked about between the LPD programs, the Destroyer programs, the Frigate programs, that expansion drives us to a place where to do all of that efficiently, we need extra capacity. And so that's where we’ve made the decision to add on that expansion.
Chris Kastner: Doug, the Ingalls team is pretty relentless about improving efficiency and activation the east bank will help in that regard as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Raviv with Citi. Your line is now open.
Colin Canfield: This is Colin Canfield on for the line of John Raviv. Just a little bit on margins, if you could you just talk a little bit about the bonus payments impacting Newport News and TS, and then with respect to the shipbuilding margins in terms of falling out of that 9% to 10% range. What are the drivers there and how long are we out of that range for?
Chris Kastner: First on the numbers, $20 million Newport News was 12 of that Ingalls was five and TS was three.
Mike Petters: And regarding the shipbuilding margins, we’ve been on a program here for a few years where we’ve talked about the healthy balance of a shipbuilding enterprise where the amount of stock that you're completing is about the same as the amount of work that you’re contracting for. That if you’re in that healthy blend and you’re executing well, you should be in the 9% to 10% range. What we’re seeing right now is -- and we've been talking about this over the last couple years, ever since the carrier got sequestered and delayed at Newport News, we’ve been a little bit out of balance. And when you get out of balance and you have a lot of work on the front end of the pipeline, we don't recognize the income from that until we retire the risk. So we’re a little bit out of balance as we go into the phase. And now we look out over the next couple years and we see the major amount of shipbuilding coming down the pipeline, so that's going to put us even more out of balance. And we think it's just important for everyone to understand that we’re executing really well. We’re executing really well in every part of our business. The opportunity right now to retire risk to drive margins up and capture that income are not as many as we have seen before. And certainly, at Newport News, there is not as many opportunities. And in the mean time, we’re going to be putting more and more work on the front end of the pipeline. And so we just want to make sure everybody understands that we’re in a really good place right now. I wouldn't trade this position for anything. We’re not having execution problems. We need to go get these ships under contract. They need to be good contracts and they’re going to serve us well for the next five to 10 years. And so that’s why I find this to be the most exciting -- frankly, this is the most exciting shipbuilding environment in over 30 years. And so where the margins go, I guess my thinking on that is that there's two major mistakes you can make in shipbuilding; the first one is you can recognize income before you retire the risk; and when you have to back that out, because you didn’t retire the risk, that’s not a small matter that’s a huge matter. And I’ve lived through a couple of those. We will not do that here at HII. The second mistake you can make is you can go and you can start trying to sign contracts to fill up the volume and the revenue, and you end up signing bad contracts. We’re in a phase right now where the biggest driver we have is, for the future success of this company, is to make sure we get good contracts going forward. So to me, this is exactly where we want to be.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Mike, some color on the sales growth. I mean you were saying 3% this quarter was extraordinarily strong. Is this something unique in this quarter that subsequently -- subsequent quarters, we’re going to see a lot of slower growth? And then on the -- for Chris if you just give us what the EAC adjustments were in the quarter? Thanks.
Chris Kastner: Well, I’ll start with the EAC adjustments. Our positive $52 million negative $24 million for a net 28 -- 80% was Ingalls, I’ll start off on sales, Mike, if you like. I mean it was a strong sales quarter. We’re still pretty comfortable with our five year CAGR of 3% growth. Obviously, if things were perfectly in the budget process and sequestration and getting all the ships awarded that we have planned under contract, it could be better than that. But we’re pretty comfortable with the 3% CAGR.
George Shapiro: There was something unique this quarter that caused the particular strength that won’t repeat in subsequent quarters?
Chris Kastner: Not really, you’re just seeing increased volume. Really the majority of that’s coming out of Newport News with the RCOH program, and 79 hitting really full throttle.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Gautam Khanna: Chris, I was hoping you could give us some directional color on where CAX pension reimbursement may trend in 2020. I know you gave us 2019 last quarter. But can you give us a ballpark on what the range of outcomes are for calendar ’20?
Chris Kastner: Gautam, I apologize for my answer before I give it. But it was -- the reason I gave ’19 was because we have that pension acceleration. I thought it was appropriate to give you guys some additional information, so you could think through ’18 and ’19. There’s just going to be factors that go into that calculation for ’20. So I think I’d be reminiscent providing that information directionally.
Gautam Khanna: Could you at least give us some sense of it -- it’s going to be down presumably, right?
Chris Kastner: Like I said, there’s -- year-to-date asset returns are 1.7% versus our assumption of 7.25%, and discount rates have gone up to 4.13%, is what our calculation was at the end of the quarter. So those are opposing directionally going in the opposite directions. And all of that will go into the calculation on what happens to ’19 and ’20. So really I’d rather not get into the directional numbers at this point.
Gautam Khanna: And stepping back at Newport in the quarter, if we add -- not that we can. But if we were to add back the $12 million of one-time bonus payments, the underlying margins 5.8%. Were there any -- on a net basis, were there negative EACs in the quarter?
Chris Kastner: None individually significant enough to mention, it’s really about what Mike said, is conservatism relative to some big programs that are taking up a significant amount of the run rate at Newport News.
Gautam Khanna: And to your guidance comment earlier about the 7% to 8% shipbuilding margin, so we should just assume there’s no major risk retirement events this year or next at MMS that allow you to take a big positive catch up? Is that -- we’re just not going to see much in the way of major milestones that would afford the opportunity positive or negative. Is that fair?
Chris Kastner: Well, Gautam, we evaluate our EACs on a quarterly basis. And we do have the submarine program that’s being executed but that’s just starting out for Block IV. But I think you’re correct, is the major millstones relative to aircraft carrier don’t show up here until 2020.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mr. Pearlstein, please check your mute button [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Ron Epstein: So just jump back to the CVN 80, 81. On that block deal, if that all goes through. Does that imply that the construction centers go from roughly five years to 3.5 years?
Mike Petters: Well, that’s certainly a way to drive some more costs out of the program. We just submitted our proposal this week to the Navy. The discussion that we’ll have over the next few months is exactly how we plan to execute that, and how they plan to -- how does the contract take shape. Our view is that if you can get away from the five or six year centers that we’ve seen and you can get to something more like three or four, you certainly will get to a place where it will be more efficient. Having said that, I would say I’m getting go back to my overall theme of -- we talked about multi-year procurement of aircraft carriers, that’s the first time in over 30 years that we’ve submitted a two-carrier proposal. That’s pretty cool, multi-ship procurement and carriers. We have submitted a multi-ship procurement in submarines proposal, we’ve submitted a multi-ship multi-year proposal for Destroyers. We’ve been selected to be the sole source provider of what was LXR, which is now LPD Flight II. That’s a pretty strong place for us to be. And it’s really important that we get these contracts right, because five years from now, folks will remember whether you’ll be able to see firsthand, whether we got the contracting of it right or not and that’s the ambition for the next couple of years.
Ron Epstein: And do have the labor to handle that? My understanding is to train a master pipefitter for military shipbuilding. It takes a number of years. I mean, do you have the labor to handle it?
Mike Petters: We’re having to labor up now. But the core of our company is that we’re a workforce development company. We know how to create workforce. We have been ramping the workforce at Newport News for a period of time now. And we have training schools, we have cracked training programs, we are using digital technology to get our workforce up to speed faster. It's really exciting to watch our young new craftsmen come in and actually take some of our digital tools, and show them to some of our more senior folks and have our senior folks engage in that. So there's a lot of excitement on the waterfront right now in terms of how we’re going to get work done, and how we’re creating this new workforce. And that's true at Newport News and it’s true at Ingalls as well. And so we’re confident that we’re on track to do what we needed to support the business from a workforce standpoint. I have more concern about supply chain. We have 5,000 suppliers there across costs virtually every state in the union. And we spend a lot of time in supply chain right now, especially with those critical suppliers to make sure that they get the signals that they need to invest, the support that they need to create, the workforce that they need -- and I will go back now to the two carrier solicitation. The fact that the government that they Pentagon sent us a proposal, a request for proposal on two carriers, is the biggest signal that the Navy could have sent to the entire supply chain that we are serious about this ramp-up in the size of the Navy. And so let's take that signal and let’s run with it, let’s go invest in our facilities and invest in our workforce and get this done. So we’re excited about that and we are seeing that excitement now in our supply chain.
Ron Epstein: And then one question quick little detail for Chris. When you look at the investment in the east bank, is all of that is going to be recoverable on the volume that will go through the east bank overtime?
Chris Kastner: Absolutely.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Joseph DeNardi: Mike, just on the 79% margin. Does the bottom end of that range assume that maybe you guys experience some challenges on carrier construction, or maybe just talk about what's driving the assumptions around that range of margins. Thank you.
Chris Kastner: Joe, really it’s what Mike already mentioned relative to the contract mix and the transition that’s taking place in Newport News. It’s no individual issue on a program, it’s just where we are on the programs that are under contract within Newport News.
Mike Petters: And I would just add to that we go into every contract, as we talked about many times. We put the entire risk register in front of us and we don't take credit for any evidence till its retired. And so if we have major setbacks in a program, it will be because of a risk that we not only did not retire, but it's that we didn't foresee, because we -- if we just take a step back on a program, it’s because we didn’t see that one coming. If we saw it coming, we’re not taking credit for it yet. So that’s the way --that’s what informs us when we think about where the business ought to be. And so like I said, the biggest sin you can make in this business is recognizing income before its time. And we’re just not going to fall into that trap.
Joseph DeNardi: I guess, what I was trying to ask is, maybe what gets you to the bottom end of the 7% range and what gets you to the high. Is there any way to clarify that a little bit?
Mike Petters: It’s just the volume of work, the time of contracts, the volume of work that’s coming in, the opportunities that we might have to recognize income along the way. I mean it’s the composite of all that that puts us in -- we just create a band around and say this is what you can expect for the next couple of years. And actually this is really good. This is a great problem for us to have right now.
Chris Kastner: I would also add, there were no major risk retirement milestones in the quarter, and we had three ship deliveries over the balance in the second half of the year.
Joseph DeNardi: Mike, maybe just at a higher level, you’re one of only two shipbuilders on certain programs you’re the sole source on others. Why can’t that degree of consolidation, if you want to call it that translates into more sustainable margins and maybe less risk for the business?
Mike Petters: Well, I mean I think in most of our situations as we’ve talked about when we go to contract, we’re not really talking much about -- and we might negotiate a little bit about price of a contract, the target of the contract. But what we’re really negotiating in our negotiations is the risk on the contract. And we’re usually in a place where the government needs the contract and we need the contract. So when we go in the room, we have differing views of how much risk there is on the program. And both of us have to walk out of the room with a contract that we are both happy with. And so you get -- and that happens -- that happen on every ship in the multiyear procurements but it happens on every block. In the case of a larger procurement, it happens on every ship. And so whatever risk retirement that you've accomplished on a previous ship affects the way that that risk discussion goes in the next contract. And so that keeps it in the band of relative performance in my view. And I think that's the pretty healthy for us and it’s healthy for the government, and it’s worked well over the years. And I think that's the way it’s going to go going forward. If you remember the discussion we’ve had here, a lot of what put the pressure on Newport News that we’ve talked about for the last year or two was really goes back to four or five years ago when there was -- we were talking about sequestration and refueling overhaul got the rate by a year. And when that happen, the start of that overhaul was delayed by a year, it put Newport News in a place where they actually had to go through a process of laying people off, getting themselves a little bit out of whack in terms of skill set in the business and then bringing those people back as we started to ramp up. That was absolutely the most inefficient way from a program management standpoint to execute. And it’s to me, it’s Exhibit A and why sequestration has been such a bad idea. Where we are today is we have a two-year budget deal. We are a company that actually benefits from this two-year budget deal in a different way than most others. A lot companies are having a discussion about what happens after the two-year budget deal is done. For us, our objective is to get as much of this under contract during this two-year window as we possibly can. And it insulates us from what happens on the back end of that. Not completely not entirely, but it certainly is a place that I’d like to be. And this shipbuilding ramp up is larger than any ramp up we’ve seen since the Reagan build up. So that’s where we’re going.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Sam Pearlstein: You talked about execution, and I guess there was some stuff in the press and I apologize if this is asked already, about the Indiana being a little bit late. Can you just talk about that construction, any issues in terms of timing on delivery?
Mike Petters: We’re just working through. This is the normal -- the romance of the business, just working through the process of delivery. The delivery of a submarine requires a whole lot of second checks and certifications and retests, and those kinds of things. And I don’t see it as to be anything exceptionally abnormal. We would certainly like it to be delivered sooner but nothing that’s causing us anything other than programmatic concern.
Sam Pearlstein: But when it comes to risk retirement upon delivery or however it might, would you see that as impacting it?
Mike Petters: We’re going to -- we’ll evaluate the EAC as it moves through the quarter and if we have an opportunity we’ll take it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Mike, I wanted to follow-up with the Kennedy. I mean, are we still in the same situation as we were last quarter as things are attracting to the accelerated learning curve you have been projecting and we really won’t know anything until 2020. Or are there some data points along the way that we might have a better clue?
Mike Petters: Well, we’re still tracking, George. The challenge on the Kennedy that we took at the beginning, we invested to take man hours out. We took a pretty significant man hour challenge on the ship, and we’re tracking to that. And so the things that we invested in are paying off for us. The leadership team is working to try to launch the ship a little bit early. We’re supportive of that. But we, as Chris said, we will be evaluating EACs on that program each quarter as we go forward.
George Shapiro: Well, I mean is there any specific time lines or data points that you could point to that we ought to be out look for?
Chris Kastner: I think launches are really good milestone that we should be tracking.
George Shapiro: And then the other quick one that I got is, even if you adjust it out for the charge last year and took out the bonus for TS this year. The profits are still down. I mean, what it takes to actually get improvements in that business?
Chris Kastner: Well, I think Mike talked a bit about it already. We’re in a transition a bit right now and we’re going to be in that transition for a while. We’re adding new programs. It’s a place that’s -- George, is your question about TS?
George Shapiro: Yes.
Chris Kastner: So we’re doing all the right things. I think we’re doing all the right things in TS. We won two programs within the DOE space for a LANL and the Nevada test site, transitioning into both of those now. Our pipelines are fairly rich within oil and gas and in government services. So I think as you see a recovery in oil and gas and we start to get it under contract within TS, you'll see the recovery.
Mike Petters: I’ll go a step further. I think we’re getting real traction in TS right now. As Chris mentioned, the awards the Nevada test site and the Los Alamos laboratory, both of those awards in the second half of last year, basically ratified our view that we can create a channel of capability to a new customer. And DOE is a very important customer with a pretty significant amount of work to do over the next -- basically the next same time next 50 years that shipbuilding is looking out to. And so getting our foot in there and improving our work and working on the hard stuff that they do and getting that right now is a way for us to expand our position in the Department of Energy space. You know we have a teaming agreement with Boeing on the UUV business. We think we’re getting traction there and this is a business that we were not anywhere near being seven years ago. And so my estimation is that the UUV businesses is going to be one of those places where a lot of people are going to want to be. But we think we’re in a good position in that business right now. The Navy's decision and discussion about increasing its readiness and trying to get complete support activity out there, that plays right to what AMSEC does is part of a technical solutions. So we've been planning, over the last couple years we’ve been planning a lot of seeds in the Technical Solutions business, some of them are starting to ripen now. And I feel comfortable that we're getting good traction there. And that's the part of our business that’s really on the move, and I'm glad that they’re part of us and I am excited about what they’re going to do for us.
George Shapiro: And Chris just one, little one. 20% tax rate in the quarter is likely the go forward rate for the year?
Chris Kastner: So I wouldn’t change the projection for the tax rate at this point, 21% I think is -- I’m comfortable with that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Gautam Khanna: Chris, I was wondering if you could help bridge us on cash flow next year. This year we have some non-recurring items like you mentioned the Avondale recovery. I think if you could clarify how much of the 251 you ultimately recover and in what years. And then what type of headwind that poses for next year -- the moving items?
Chris Kastner: Thanks for the question, Gautam. I’ll see if I can answer the right question at this time. I’ve talked about 2018 cash already. We have about $100 million of pressure from our finished ’17, which was $452 million. Really the only -- and included in that number is the restructuring cash recovery. So the only significant difference between ’18 and ’19 is going to be the difference in that pension. So you have about $400 million difference there. And if you just focus on that assuming capital is about the same then I think you got a reasonable set of assumptions for ’19 that is assuming all things remain the same relative to pension.
Gautam Khanna: So just to follow-up on that. Last quarter, you guys provided that table where you showed the 549 of tax pension this year dropping to 90 something next year. Obviously, there is a cash tax benefit associated with contributing to the plan. So should we be thinking about the 549 this year -- it’s not the year-to-year change of 549 minus 92, it’s 549 times one minus last year's marginal tax rate, so whatever that is, 370. And then next year, 92 at next year's marginal tax rate of 70. The delta is actually $300 million year-to-year in terms of cash…
Chris Kastner: A better way to think about, Gautam -- so we don’t do calculations on the phone here, it’s just cash taxes are about the same in ’18 and ’19.
Gautam Khanna: Cash taxes are the same, okay. So your point is on the net basis, the difference in pension after tax net is $400 million year-to-year?
Chris Kastner: Its $400 million for net pension and cash taxes are about the same in ’18 and ’19.
Gautam Khanna: But the follow-up on the Avondale question, of the 251 that was on the books, how much you ultimately recover? And I just want to know how much is in this year versus next year?
Chris Kastner: So remember, the $251 million is overhead expense, it has to go through your contracts through the profitability on the contract, and then through your billing rates. So it’s all the specifics number that will be recovered relative to restructuring, because you have to do it on a contract-by-contract basis. I would say that the vast majority will be recovered in ’18. We also recovered some in ’17 in Q4.
Gautam Khanna: But just to be clear, of the $251 million. Do you actually recover all $251 million, or is there a cost share on it where the government gets call it half, and you guys get half?
Chris Kastner: That’s right.
Gautam Khanna: So half of the $251 million is ultimately recovered, some of it in Q4 last year, most of it this year?
Chris Kastner: Gautam, I know you are trying to get to a precise number here, but it’s really difficult to, because you’re dealing with share lines. Some actually have contract protection where you’re doing contact adjustments for them. Some you don't where you’re just writing share line and have 50-50 share. So it's all in the $100 million pressure that I mentioned and it will -- the vast majority would be recovered in ’18.
Gautam Khanna: So on a net basis, and I am sorry to be annoying about the questions, but people are trying to anchor to something here with the guidance revision on earnings, or the margin guidance on earnings. The free cash flow next year net should rise assuming everything is equal by about $400 million before considering executions…
Chris Kastner: Assuming everything is equal from a pension assumption standpoint -- and remember as my predecessor used to say, cash can be lumpy because we do have large contracts where large invoices can move across the period. So yes, your fundamental assumption is correct.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Carter Copeland: Mike, I wondered just one final one here on the commentary on the Navy this quarter. And the 355 ships by the end of next decade instead of the following decade, and the incremental language around service life extension in Los Angeles class submarines. How much of that, if any, is incremental to the type of growth outlook that you talked about last quarter and you’re talking about this quarter beyond the setup? Any color you can give us on that evolution that maybe different than what you talked about last quarter?
Mike Petters: The short answer is, not much different than what we’ve been saying. There is a fixation on number, because that’s how the Navy communicates to the Congress and to the country what its requirements are. As you know, when they come up with a number, they put it into a plan that was going to be many, many years couple of decades before they get close to that. And so there is a lot of question back saying if you really going -- if we really need 355 ships then we need to get there as fast as we can. So getting there as fast as you can means that not only do you ramp up construction, which is what we’ve been talking about for most of the last hour, you also need to go and make sure that you bring along the other ships that you’ve got. And kind of hard to go and ask the citizens to pay for a bigger Navy if you’re not doing everything you can to take care of the assets that you have. So whether it’s refueling a few 688s that are assessed to be worthwhile, or maybe you bring cruisers back or maybe there is extensions on Destroyers, all of that is part of, I think the reality of -- our Navy is trapped. We talked about this a year and half ago that our own internal assessment was that the Navy was probably 20% short of ships. The Navy assessment came out with some precision in that number, but that’s all consistent saying that we’re asking our Navy to do stuff and their operating tempos are too high, they don’t have enough ships to be in all the places that they need to be and they need to get as many of them out there as they possibly can. So I am not terribly fixated on the 355 as a number, because you get into all discussion about what you’re counting and what you’re not counting and does this count as a ship, and I don’t really spend a lot of time on that. What I can tell you right now is that the Navy is moving forward with multi-ship procurement across its most complex platforms. And they’re moving out in a way that we haven’t seen since the Reagan era. That is a major change in this space, and that’s why I come back to -- this is the most exciting time for us to be in the space. You may remember Carter that the Reagan buildup was for 600-ship Navy, we never got to 600. I think that we got into the 580s before we backed away from that. So that’s why I don’t fixate so much on the number as I focus on what are they doing. Releasing the two-ship RFP for the carrier is a huge signal to the industry that we are going to expand the Navy. And so like I said last quarter, I have to practice saying the word growth. I now am a believer. We are moving down a path to expand the Navy and this company is going to be the principal partner in making that happen and we’re excited about that.
Carter Copeland: That’s great. It’s not about the -- it’s about the journey, not the destination, got it.
Mike Petters: That’s exactly right.
Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. So with that, I’ll turn the conference back over to CEO, Mr. Mike Petters for any further remarks.
Mike Petters: Well, I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call. As you can tell, I am very excited about where we are and where our shipbuilding business is headed. But I am equally excited about the traction we’re getting in our Technical Solutions division today. This big piece of contracting that we’re going to be doing is going to actually move us out of the balance that we've been talking about for seven years in the 9% to 10% range. It’s going to put pressure on the low end of the scale. If I have to choose between having pressure on the low end of the scale, because I have too many new contracts to work, or having out of the margin high, because I am executing a lot of material work and not getting new contracts, I’d absolutely choose to be where we are today. I am excitedly to be partnered with the Pentagon to go get all this work done. And we have a team that’s executing well, and is well positioned to get this done over the next couple of years. So as we do that, we will continue to focus on execution, because that's been the hallmark of what we do and I’m excited about that. So thanks for joining us this morning, and I look forward to seeing you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-02-15 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries' Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.

With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks Dwayne. Let me start out by saying that we at Huntington Ingalls are extending our prayers and thoughts and appreciation to the folks in Florida that are associated with that terrible tragedy yesterday. Our hearts and prayers reach out to them. So, good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today on this business meeting. Today we released fourth quarter and full year financial results from our seventh year of operations as a publicly traded company. I want to take a minute to thank our team of nearly 38,000 employees that produce these results by remaining laser-focused on our operational pillars of safety, quality, cost and schedule. But before I discuss the financial results, let me share my thoughts on a couple of topics. Adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act commonly referred to as Tax Reform has created an opportunity for us to increase investments in three important areas. The first area is our facilities. Recall that in late 2015 we made a commitment to invest $1.5 billion of capital in our Shipbuilding business through 2020. These investments are intended to improve affordability, efficiency and competitiveness and to preserve and protect current and future U.S. Navy programs. Tax Reform will allow us to increase this commitment by an additional $300 million. These funds are designated for facility improvements that expand operational capacity at Ingalls and for investment in digital tools to improve operational efficiencies at Newport News. The second area is our employees. We will provide a one-time cash benefit of $500 to each hourly and salaried employee. In addition, we are accelerating discretionary contributions of approximately $200 million in 2018 for our qualified pension plans. Chris will provide more details on our pension outlook during his remarks. And the third area is our communities. We are increasing our investments through charitable – through additional charitable contributions to organizations across the country where we live and work. Even with these increased investments, we are maintaining our path to 2020 commitment to return substantially all of our free cash flow to shareholders through annual dividend increases of at least 10% and opportunistic share repurchases. The other topic I want to discuss is our outlook for Shipbuilding. When we developed our path to 2020 strategy three year ago, the revenue outlook was stable based on Congress providing funding to support the Navy's 308 ship plan of record. Since that time, the new National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy have reexamined the perspective composition and legality of the future force. Additionally, the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act included the SHIPS Act, which is an important signal that demonstrates the nation's commitment to a larger fleet. We stand ready to increase production to support a larger fleet and if that perspective work occurs, we could envision a sales growth rate of approximately 3% over the next five years. This comes with the usual caveats regarding the adequacy of future budget request and a need for the Congress to resolve the final two years of sequestration and provide timely appropriations. Our long-term shipbuilding return on sales target remains in the 9% to 10% range. However in the near term, we may fall slightly below the lower end of that range from time-to-time as we continue through the transition period on programs at Newport News and begin the transition to new programs at Ingalls. Our outlook for Technical Solutions revenue and return on sales remains unchanged. Revenue is expected to grow in the low-single digit range and return on sales is expected to expand from low-single digits to the 5% to 7% range by 2020. Now let me share some highlights from the quarter and full year starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2 billion for the quarter and $7.4 billion for the full year were both higher than 2016. Diluted EPS was $1.41 for the quarter and $10.46 for the full year. Adjusting for the one-time cost to refinance our seven-year notes and for one-time tax expense related to Tax Reform and additional discretionary pension contributions, EPS was $3.11 for the quarter and $12.14 for the full year. Operating cash was $434 million for the quarter and $814 million for the year. 2017 was another strong year operationally as we delivered or redelivered six ships to the U.S. Navy. Most notably, the lead ship of the Ford class aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and we received $8.1 billion in new contract awards during the year, resulting in backlog of $21 billion at the end of the year of which $13 billion is funded. Now, I will provide a few points of interest on our business segments. Ingalls had another busy quarter as they laid the keel for LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale and DDG 123 Lenah H. Sutcliffe Higbee, christened DDG 119 Delbert D. Black, delivered DDG 114 Ralph Johnson and launched and christened NSC 8 Midgett. In addition the team extended the collective bargaining agreement with its labor unions for an additional four years. At Newport News, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 68% structurally complete and 40% complete overall. We continue to be pleased with the quality of the work and the incorporation of lessons learned from the lead ship of the class, the USS Gerald R. Ford. On the submarine program, SSN 789 Indiana remains on track to be delivered to the Navy in the first half of 2018, while activity continues to ramp up on Block IV boats. In addition, integrated product and process development work is underway for the Columbia-class program. Turning to Technical Solutions, the team secured a key win as a part of the LLC that was selected to perform the Los Alamos National Laboratory Legacy Cleanup Contract. That contract is valued at $1.4 billion over a period of 10-years and provides another opportunity to partner with the Department of Energy on a very important long-term project. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our 2017 results and remain confident in our ability to execute our path to 2020 strategy. We are poised to benefit from modest growth in shipbuilding in the near-term and our Technical Solutions business is creating the building blocks for a bright future. Our credit profile has significantly improved over the past seven years and we are well positioned to continue delivering long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. So that concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials.
Chris Kastner: Thanks Mike and good morning. Today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year consolidated results as well as provide you with some information on the outlook for 2018. Before I get into the results, let me review a couple of one-time items that are included in our financials. We adjusted net earnings $14 million for the one-time expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additionally, we adjusted net earnings $63 million for the impact of tax reform, $56 million for the write-down of our net, the deferred tax assets and $7 million associated with an expected $214 million acceleration of discretionary pension contributions into 2018. Please refer to the earnings presentation on our website or the earnings release for more information on these adjustments as well as the segment results. Turning to our consolidated fourth quarter results on Slide 4 of the presentation, revenue in the quarter of $2 billion increased 3.9% over fourth quarter 2016, primarily due to a full quarter of Camber sales of $70 million versus one month of Camber sales of $23 million in 2016 and higher volumes in Navy nuclear support services and aircraft carriers at Newport News, partially offset by lower volumes on the NSC and DDG programs at Ingalls. Operating income for the quarter of $227 million increased $41 million or 15.3% from fourth quarter 2016 and operating margin of 11.4% decreased 257 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by $50 million of favorable one-time items at Newport News in 2016 and lower risk retirement at Ingalls, partially offset by improved performance at Technical Solutions and a favorable FAS/CAS adjustment. Moving on to the consolidated results for the full year on Slide 5, revenues were $7.4 billion for the year, an increase of 5.3% from 2016. This increase is primarily driven by a full year of Camber sales of $309 million in 2017 compared to one month of sales in 2016, higher volumes in aircraft carriers and Navy nuclear support services at Newport News and higher volumes in amphibious assault ships at Ingalls. Operating income for the year was $865 million and operating margin was 11.6%. Additionally, interest expense was $94 million for the year, an increase of $20 million from the prior year due to the bond refinancing in December. Our effective income tax rate was 65.8% for the quarter and 38% for the full year. This compares to 21.5% and 26.9%, respectively, for fourth quarter and full year 2016. These increases were primarily due to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets as a result of Tax Reform. Turning to cash flow on Slide 6 of the presentation, cash from operations was $434 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $301 million. For the full year, cash from operations was $814 million and free cash flow was $453 million. Compared to 2016, cash from operations of $822 million and free cash flow of $537 million. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily due to lower net pension benefit and increased capital expenditures in 2017. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $133 million and for the year $361 million or 4.9% of sales. This compares to $285 million or 4% of sales in 2016. Cash contribution to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans were $335 million in the year, of which $294 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plan. Additionally, we repurchased approximately 174,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $41 million, bringing the total number of shares repurchased in 2017 to approximately $1.4 million at a cost of $288 million. We also paid dividends of $0.72 per share, or $33 million in the quarter bringing totals dividends paid for the year to $115 million. Now let me provide you with some items for 2018 as shown on Slide 7. We expect non-current state income tax benefit to be in the $8 million to $12 million range, and our effective income tax rate to be approximately 21%. We expect interest expense of approximately $63 million for the year and we expect capital expenditures as a percent of sales to be between 5% and 6%. As Mike mentioned in his comments, Tax Reform allows us to increase our capital expenditure commitment through 2020 by an additional $300 million. Turning to Slide 8, I'd like to provide you with some perspective on FAS/CAS and pension contributions for 2018 and 2019. These assumptions are based on the pension discount rates and asset returns as identified on Slide 8. As you are aware, pension is sensitive to changes in needs and other assumption, but because of Tax reform, I thought it would be helpful to provide you with an understanding of our current baseline. We expect favorable net FAS/CAS adjustment of $369 million in 2018 and $356 million in 2019. As a reminder, starting in 2018, we have adopted the new retirement benefit standard ASU 2017-07, which moves all components to the FAS, pension and post-retirement benefit expense except for service cost from operating to non-operating income with no impact to net income. And as Mike mentioned, we plan to accelerate a portion of the 2019 discretionary pension contribution of $214 million into fiscal year 2018. This makes our planned cash contributions to pension and post-retirement benefit plans $549 million in 2018 and $92 million in 2019, of which $508 million and $49 million, respectively, are discretionary contributions to our qualified plans. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Sabrina, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Doug Harned: I was interested, Mike, in your comments about the budget and you are saying that you could look at potentially a 3% top-line growth rate going forward. When you think about that, is that how you look at it based on the 2018 and 2019 budget proposals, or is that tied more to your Navy goal of 355 ship Navy, because I don't see those as necessarily exactly tracking together, so I guess what do you base the 3% outlook on?
Mike Petters: Yeah. I think – Doug, thanks for the question. It's a little bit of both. You know I had to actually go practice how to save the word growth a few times before this call. We hadn't had a chance to talk about growth in Shipbuilding for a long time. And yet, here we are, we have a budget and a 30-year plan and a National Security Strategy that are all aligned. And if you look at the way this came out, they came out kind of in series the way they were supposed to come out and they came out on time. You know what's encouraged, there's a lot of things that are encouraging to me. Doug, I have been saying for a long-time that I have been worried about how the Columbia-class was going to be paid for without affecting the budget. If you look at the budget and you look at the 30-year plan, it looks like resources are going to be allocated to not create that effect, not create impact. We're going to pay for it. That's really encouraging to me. It's also encouraging to me that, the 30-year plan and the budget and all the documents basically talk about working with industry to find the most efficient ways to do these things. I have been calling that out as a great recognition of the opportunity we have to go and do things more efficiently and maybe even get some things done faster. At the end of the day though, we only do one budget at a time and as we look at the timing of the programs that we're involved with, over the next couple of years, most of those programs were going to be trying to go to contract on in some fashion. And so the startup of those programs and the timing of those programs and how that plays out, all of that kind of comes together and says, it looks like about a 3% target over the next five years. And, we'll adjust that accordingly as we get more facts and get deeper into it. But that's kind of the way we're thinking about it right now. And we're cautiously optimistic that you know we're ready to go here.
Doug Harned: When you talked about CapEx and the new depreciation rules making that more attractive and you are making more investments now. Is that – are those investments separate from what you might think about if you start to see this become more concrete. In other words, are you going to be doing some investing, a little bit ahead of a potential growth in programs or is it something that you'll have to wait a little while to see contract get formalized?
Chris Kastner: Actually Doug I think we started investing a few years ago. And we talked about the need for a generational type investment in the capacity and capability of our shipyards to support that – to support our view of what the Navy needed to be. What this is doing is sort of, this is validating our decision to get out and invest early. And so, we think we're pretty well poised in position right now to answer the call and move ahead.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of John Raviv with Citi. Your line is now open.
John Raviv: Hey, Mike can you just qualify the 3% growth number. Is that supposed to be a CAGR over five years, and if so, should we think about it being either back-loaded or front-loaded or how do you think that kind of thing rolls out, given what – normally what you're seeing in the budget now, but the budgets that have been passed and got signature already?
Chris Kastner: This is Chris. It's a five year CAGR, rather not comment on front-loaded or back-loaded. But the way we're looking at the budget and the way we're looking at our plans look as if we could get that sort of growth rate.
John Raviv: Understood. And then, Mike, I was wondering if you could just give us some historical context for the last time you made facility improvements or generational investments, what did you do? Who paid for it? How long did it take and what did you – what do you feel like you got on the other end for it, was it more ability and more efficiency? Just kind of curious and your perspective there…
Mike Petters: That's a really interesting question that we could probably spend all day talking about. I mean the history of the business has been that we've made investment – typically made investments when we can look down the sideline of a program with some confidence that the program is going to be there. They will make big investments, then either the program will pan out or it won't. At Newport News for instance, there were some pretty significant investments made by Tenneco back in the 1980s in support of Newport News participating in the Seawolf program. When the cold war ended and that program got truncated, that – that Newport News did not have any participation in the construction of those programs and those facilities had to be redeployed. My observation of that was that the value of those facilities, they became valuable to other programs and so our ability actually to specifically quantify the capital investments to a particular program, my personal observation is we need to be better than that. We build facilities that are – in the end are going to outlast programs and they are going to be flexibly used for other programs along the way, and so that's what led us to the decision that we were going to make these generational investments a few years ago because we knew that first of all our investment would help actually create future where the Navy would have some confidence that they can move ahead with the program. Secondly, that these facilities would outlast any program that was on the record at that point in time. And so, you know I don't want to say that this was the first time we made generational investments, but it was a major departure from a way that at least in my experience and history, the way that we had always invested in the past. And so, we've been confidently going down that path. Like I said, this – the last series of events with the national security strategy and the budget and the 30-year plan at this point seemed to validate that perspective and we're pretty excited about where we are.
Operator: Thank you and the next question will come from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.
Pete Skibitski: Hey Mike can you got into any more detail on your thoughts on the five-year shipbuilding plan just because you know when I look through it, I saw good thing, I saw less good things for you guys in terms of, more DDG 51s and thinking about still that gap on the LHA, I think – I didn't see any more NSCs, so how are you thinking about the puts and takes there and the ability for Congress to shape it, just little more thoughts on that?
Mike Petters: Well, I mean, you know if I were write the 30-year plan, it would probably look a little bit different than the one that the Navy wrote. But that's okay, that's part of the process. And there are certainly some things that we could go in and say we would prefer to see this in this place or that in that place. But quite frankly, what I – the first thing that I looked at was the resourcing of the 30-year plan and the call-out for the expansion of resources across the plan to go and build – I mean the phrase you know to create the Navy the Nation Needs, strikes me as the right way to go about doing a 30-year plan. As opposed to trying to maybe in the past we might have done the nation – the Navy the nation can afford. And so, we got to get into how all that's going to work out, but where we have some opportunities to engage with the Navy and to engage with the Congress on more efficient ways to perceive, we'll do that. But all-in-all I'm pretty pleased with where it sits right now.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. So, as it stands, the LHA gap, doesn't present a big marketing challenge or workforce challenge for Ingalls kind of by itself as ways to mitigate that. It looks like they did add more LPDs?
Mike Petters: No, I wouldn't say that. I mean if it actually executed the way that it is in the plan, that would – that's something that we would be engaging on, say that there is a better way and more efficient way and more productive way to build in those – build that product and build those product lines. So, I'm not ready to say that, you know we completely 100% endorse the way that it's laid out, but we'll be engaging with the Navy on those things that we think could be improved. And you've highlighted one, the LHA is one of those areas that we will be talking about.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius. Your line is now open.
Carter Copeland: I wondered if you might just give us a little bit of color about the incremental $300 million CapEx how that's splits between you know facilities improvements versus the capacity expansion efforts you mentioned?
Chris Kastner: So, Carter this is Chris. $200 million of that is related to facilities and equipment primarily at Ingalls and increasing capacity. And we have a $100 million of it related to additional digital tools at Newport News.
Carter Copeland: Okay great and then another one Chris with respect to the pension pre-fund, where does that put you now on a funded status when you look out at the 2019 and 2020 on risk basis? I would assume you are at a pretty good spot here in terms of contributions looking beyond what you laid out for 2018 and 2019?
Chris Kastner: You asked a good question. So, yearend we are at 89% funded on a FAS basis. We don't give specific numbers for 2018 and 2019, but when we have a $900 million liability and we are essentially cutting it in half. So I don't want to project what's going to go on and what's going to happen with asset returns and discount rates till the next couple of years.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Rob Spingarn: So Mike, as we change Blocks here on Virginia-class and on DDG 51 into Flight III. Could you talk a little bit maybe in more detail about the timing on unit revenue increases and changes in margin profile? I think, Flight III adds some complexity on the DDG 51, and then of course just the higher unit numbers on the Virginia-class, and when that should flow through?
Mike Petters: Yeah. So, first of all, I am not sure that I am going to talk about any particular program like that. I think what I would tell you is, what we've talked about before, that the healthy business has to have the right amount of new work coming in and the right amount of mature work in the business, so that in a blended way you end up being in a 9% to 10% range. Certainly, where you just got the RP for the multiyear on the DDGs and we're beginning to work on getting through to the next Block, Block V on Virginia-class. And we've talked a lot about how that, the start up with those programs, we have pretty good risk registers and we don't take credit for retiring the risk until we retire. I think what I would tell you at this point is that if we really are going to expand the Navy the way that these documents suggest and the way that people are talking about, what that's going to do is that's actually going heavier – it's going to put a heavier weight on the new work than what we have today on mature work. And so that's going to swing our overall. That's my comment about how as we transit – we began transitioning programs at Newport News. We are going to go through a transition at Ingalls as we expand, and so that's going to put a little bit of pressure on the bottom side of that band.
Rob Spingarn: Well, that's really my question, Mike is, when is that Ingalls transition just with all the budget numbers moving around and the ramps and so forth? When is the timeframe for that transition? Because I think what you are implying is 11.8% doesn't happen, when that happens in terms of margin?
Mike Petters: I mean, when that happens, when you see a number like that, it means that they've been very successful retiring risk on very mature programs. It's not hard to go through and kick off starting at the very top. There is going to be a new carrier, hopefully two in our contract base in the next couple of years. There is going to be a new block of submarines in our contract base in the next 24 months. There is going to be a new flight of destroyers in our contract base. There is going to be a new flight in transition to LXR in our contract base. We are ramping up right now on LHA 8. And so, just about every single one of our programs over the next 24 months, we are going to be going to new contract on. And so, my view of that is that this is going to play out over the next couple of years, maybe two or three years. And depending on the timing of those contracts, it could extend to the fourth year. But that's – I mean that's all – it's all good because its expansion of the business at a time when we are executing really well. And it allows us to set the stage to move those programs to a point where they are mature for us in the out years. That's why I am really excited about this and we don't typically break any of the programs down by program. But in general, the expansion of the Navy is going to create near term pressure as we take on that risk and long term opportunity as we harvest those programs.
Rob Spingarn: No. Mike, you've proven over the last half decade or so that you're going to book conservatively and then hit your numbers. You guys have been executing very, very well. What I am trying to figure out is as we get this 3% revenue CAGR, can EBIT keep up if the margins profile is going to change that?
Chris Kastner: So Rob, This is Chris. A good bellwether is the launch of CVN 79 in 2020.
Rob Spingarn: Okay.
Mike Petters: That's a good point, Chris. That's sort of a point where we will be able to assess where we stand relative to most of the programs we have.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Good morning. I don't know whether others are having a problem, but the quality to the call is not very good. So hopefully I am not repeating a question. But I had for you Chris, free cash flow in 2018 I assume was probably going to be less in 2017 given the increased CapEx [Technical Difficulty]?
Chris Kastner: Can you hear me now?
George Shapiro: I hear much better now.
Chris Kastner: Okay. I can't hear you very well. But I think your question was about cash flow in 2018, it's a good point relative to the additional capital on the net pension. We finished around $450 million free cash in 2017. I probably have about $100 million of pressure to that in 2018.
George Shapiro: And then Mike, you'd mentioned that the margins could be a little bit lower in the next year or two. Is that just the Newport News and the pressure from the Kennedy, and if you could also update as to when you think you'll be able to ensure that you're going to be right on your learning curve at some point as opposed to the Navy?
Mike Petters: Yeah George, I think I made that out major question out. And we just talked about that with Rob, but I would just say Chris makes a good point in that conversation that the launch of Kennedy in 2020 is the place where we will be able to do a true risk assessment on how much risk did we retire, how much do we still have? Did we get what we wanted? You know, all of the classic stuff we do when we watch these major events. What I can tell you right now on the Kennedy is that we are seeing significant progress being made in terms of the construction schedule. And we are seeing that the investments we made to take man hours out are generally working. So, we are pretty excited about that.
George Shapiro: So, is that the concern is to your comment that the margins could dip below the 9% to 10% in the next couple of years?
Chris Kastner: No. The concern I have about margins is just the macro concern that and it's not a concern, it's just an observation. The observation is that as we expand the volume here, we are going to go to contract in just about every one of our programs over the next couple of years. This is all new work. Every piece of new work that we bring in brings with it a risk register. When we see that risk register, we don't take credit for retiring it until we retire it. So we are going to have as we expand the business, we are going to have more risk registers to go manage and what that's going to do is that that's going to mean more volume of new business relative to volume of mature business, which will swing the pendulum more towards the low end of the range. That's the point of the conversation.
George Shapiro: And is that more skewed to Newport verses Ingalls?
Mike Petters: It's every program, George, across the business. Newport News has frankly been going through this for the last couple of years as they've been transitioning from Ford to Kennedy, transitioning from Lincoln to George Washington, transitioning from Block III to Block IV and we are getting ready to start in on Block V. They've been working on this for a couple of years. Their programs have longer horizons, but we see this across the whole business over the next couple of years.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Gautam Khanna: Chris, maybe for you on your comments on free cash, down about $100 million, what does that contemplate through the Avondale recovery in 2018?
Chris Kastner: That's a really good question. Remember the Avondale restructuring settlement is related to overheard expense, which is incorporated into our contracts, our billing rates, run through share lines at some point that we recover from our customer. So, on the specific number related to that and we'll trickle in this year and you'll see a reduction in the working capital at Ingalls. But at the end of the day it's incorporated into the information I gave you relative to the headwind I have in 2018 versus what we finished in 2017 of $100 million.
Gautam Khanna: Okay, so it's embedded in the rates?
Chris Kastner: Yes, absolutely, it's overhead cost.
Gautam Khanna: Mike, maybe for you, could you give us some sort of context on Columbia-class revenues over the next three years ahead of actual construction starting in 2021. I know you have some design revenue. What are you recognizing and when will you recognize some of the long lead time items. And the last thing, what are you guys expecting in 2018?
Chris Kastner: Well, this is Chris, Gautam. We're working on that on that program now. You've got it right relative to the first boat and we'll ramp from here to there kind of incrementally, but that's all contained with the information Mike gave you relative to the 3%, rough 3% CAGR over the next five years.
Gautam Khanna: Can you give us a ballpark of what you expect the revenues on that program to be in call in 2020, 2021 something like that, because I know the share line 22%, you transitioned from design to actual production, is there any sort of sizing of it?
Chris Kastner: We don't usually get into the sizing of each program, so we'll pass on that.
Gautam Khanna: Last question, Technical Solutions. Are you seeing any signs of life in UPI, and is that finally turning into the black and anything you can comment on business momentum there?
Chris Kastner: Yes, so that's a good question. Glad you asked it. UPI, that team is operating very well has got their cost structure squared away. They are adding people up in Canada and they are stable in Houston and they are competing very well for new projects and they have a very robust pipeline. So, really positive on how UPI is performing right now.
Operator: Thank you and I'm showing now further question at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Mr. Mike Petters for further remarks.
Mike Petters: Okay. Well, thank you and thanks for joining us on the call today. And as I mentioned earlier, we are executing well across the business in everything that we're doing. We have key wins in our Technical Solutions area. We're poised to build the Navy the Nation Needs and we are excited about our future going forward. We want to thank you all for joining us today and we appreciate your interest in HII. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes your program, you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-11-08 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Third Quarter 2017 Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dwayne Blake. Please go ahead.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries’ third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President of Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that are not historical facts, are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also, in the remarks today, Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including certain segment and adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our Web site. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our Web site at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation, as well as our earnings release. With that, I’ll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us on today’s call. Today, we reported solid third quarter results that once again met our expectations. These results are a function of the unwavering commitments to safety, quality, cost and schedule by our team of nearly 37,000 employees. So let me share some highlights from the quarter, starting on slide three of the presentation. Sales of $1.86 billion were up 10.7% from last year and diluted EPS was $3.27 for the quarter. Operating cash was $96 million for the quarter and we received approximately $3 billion in new contract awards, including $2.8 billion contract for the refueling and complex overhaul of CVM 73 USS George Washington. As a result, backlog was approximately $23 billion at the end of the quarter of which $14 billion is funded. Yesterday, we announced that our Board of Directors approved 20% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.60 per share to $0.72 per share. We also increased our share repurchase program from the most recent authority of $1.2 billion to $2.2 billion and extended the term from October 2019 to October 2022. These decisions allow us to continue executing our path to 2020 commitment to return substantially all of our free cash flow to shareholders. Regarding activities in Washington. We are pleased with the progress being made by the Defense committees and Congress on the fiscal 2018 budget, and remain encouraged by the support for our ship building programs in various builds. While we currently find ourselves operating under a continuing resolution, we remain optimistic that Congress will return to regular order and complete the defense authorization and appropriations process in the months ahead. However, as I have said numerous times before the Budget Control Act continues to cause a great degree of uncertainty for the entire shipbuilding industrial base, because Congress is yet to determine how the Columbia class submarines will be funded without impacting other critically important shipbuilding priorities. As the administration builds the fiscal year 2019 budget, we continue to advocate for multi ship procurement strategies, program accelerations and economic order quantity purchase of material for Ford class Aircraft Carries, LXR class amphibi ships, Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and Virginia class submarines. These actions would allow us to capture the inherent efficiencies and significant cost savings achieved by leveraging high production lives in multi-ship material purchases. Now, I’ll provide a few points of interest on our business segments. Ingalls had a very busy quarter as they completed acceptance trials and delivered LPD 27 Portland to the Navy in mid-September. The team also completed acceptance trials on DDG 114 Ralph Johnson and is on track to deliver the ship to the navy by the end of year. In addition, Ingalls launched DDG 119 Delbert D. Black, Christen LHA 7AAA and were selected to repair damage to DDG 62 USS Fitzgerald. At Newport News, the team continues to work through their transition period on the aircraft carrier and submarine programs. CDM 79 Kennedy is approximately 60% structurally complete and 35% complete overall. Construction is progressing very well as the team focuses on unit outfitting and assembly in a dry-dock. In addition, the teams achieved a significant milestone with the first cut of feel for CVN 80 Enterprise. This is the third Ford-class Aircraft carrier, and it has the distinction of being the 9th U.S. Navy vessel to bear that grade name. On the submarine program SSN 789 Indiana, the 8th Virginia-class boat to be delivered by Newport News is expected to be complete early next year, while activity ramps on the Block IV boats. And turning to Technical Solutions. The team continues to execute very well. They are capturing key contracts and effectively working through the integration of seven separate businesses into four business units. So in closing our programs continue to perform well. Our financial results are solid. And our cash deployment strategy remains on track. We are maintaining our focus on safety, quality, cost and schedule, and we remain committed to a culture that produces affordable high quality products and services for our customers, which in turn, creates long term sustainable value for our shareholders and stability for our employees. So that concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Mike and good morning. Today, I will review our third quarter consolidated and segment results, as well as provide you with a few updates for the end of the year. Starting with our consolidated results on slide four of the presentation, revenues in the quarter of $1.86 billion increased 10.7% over third quarter 2016, primarily due to increased volume in Newport News and the acquisition of Camber, which contributed approximately $74 million. Operating income for the quarter of $237 million increased $62 million or 35% from third quarter 2016, and operating margin of 12.7% increased 232 basis points. These increases were primarily driven by the resolution of outstanding contract changes on CVN 65 and 72 at Newport News, the reversal of a portion of an accounts receivable allowance at Technical Solutions, strong performance at Ingalls and a higher FAS/CAS Adjustment. Turning to slide five of the presentation. Cash from operations was $96 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $5 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $91 million compared to $60 million in the third quarter of 2016. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were 4.2% of revenues and we expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately 5% of revenues. Additionally, during the quarter, we made $203 million of discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans, completing our contributions for fiscal year 2017 of $294 million. We also repurchased approximately 178,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $37 million and paid dividends of $0.60 per share or $27 million, bringing our quarter end cash balance to $499 million. As Mike mentioned, our Board increased our quarterly dividend 20% to $0.72 per share and expanded our share repurchase authority by $1 billion, demonstrating our continued commitment to returning substantially all free cash flow to shareholders through fiscal year 2020. Turning to segment results on slide six of the presentation. Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $593 million increased 2.8% from the same period last year, driven by higher volumes on the LPD and LHA programs, partially offset by lower volume on the NSC program. Ingalls segment operating income was $74 million and margin of 12.5% in the quarter were up $8 million and 104 basis points year-over-year respectively, primarily due to higher risk retirement on the LPD program, partially offset by lower risk retirement on the NSC program. Moving to slide seven of the presentation, Newport News revenues of $1 billion in the quarter increased 7.7% from the same period last year, driven by higher volumes on aircraft carriers and submarines. Newport News operating income was $96 million in the quarter with the operating margin of 9.1%. Operating income was up $28 million and operating margin up 216 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the resolution of outstanding contract changes on CVN 65 and 72, partially offset by lower risk retirement on VCS Block III. Now the technical solutions on slide eight of the presentation. Revenues of $241 million in the quarter increased 56% from the same period last year, primarily due to the acquisition of Camber and higher volumes and fleet support. Technical Solutions operating income of $22 million increased $16 million year-over-year and operating margin was 9.1% compared to 3.9% in Q3 2016. These increases were primarily due to the reversal of $13 million, and accounts receivable allowance related to the Westinghouse bankruptcy filing. Now, for an update on some other items for 2017. We expect the FAS/CAS adjustment of approximately $190 million, interest expense of $70 million, non-current state income tax expense in the $5 million to $10 million range and our effective income tax rate to be 30% to 32%. Also, I would like to give you an update on a couple of items we’ve been tracking. First, in late September, the IRS released final regulations and other guidance on the new mortality tables that will impact our defined-benefit plans that will become effective in 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of these updates on our expected future contributions, and we’ll provide the results during our fourth quarter call. Second, Moody's and Fitch, recently joined S&P in rating HII investment grade. With the upgrade, we continue to analyze potential refinance opportunities. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Andrew, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Doug Harned: You are now at a place for investment where your CapEx is going to at 4% to 5% of revenue level, that’s what you’ve previously forecast. But when you look forward, can you talk about what you see the future capital investments being for and how long should we expect these levels to continue?
Chris Kastner: Look, 4% to 4.5% and now the 5% we forecast for the end of the year, that’s all part of our $1.5 billion capital commitment that we made from 2016 to 2020. And I’ve continued indicate that we should be back at around 2.5% of sales in 2021. That being said, it's our additional capital or opportunities for potential future programs where we need to make capital investments that’s definitely something we would evaluate.
Mike Petters: And Doug, I would just add that the capital plan that we have supports the 300 ship navy. If we actually see sustainable opportunity to expand the navy and we need to go and invest in that, we obviously would do that, in addition that we have already programmed.
Doug Harned: And on that, can you give us the sense obviously you're talking with a lot of people in the Navy and on the hill. When you look at the discussions today, there seems to be pretty broad support for growing the size of the Navy. But obviously, we've got some real challenges getting a budget through in Congress. Can you give us a sense of how your discussions have gone and the timing, which you see the prospects for taking basically your work up in scale. I'm not saying that very well. But when you talk about these investments, how do you see this difficult scenarios potentially unfolding for Huntington Ingalls?
Mike Petters: Well, I think that's kind of the big question everywhere, right. I think the environment for general support and recognition that the Navy needs to be larger, that's pretty well understood in just about every corner. And that's frankly, in my career, that's a bit unusual and it's a good place to be. It's a good place to start from. The question of how you get the budget process through continues to be challenging. And I think the Budget Control Act setting on top of that as the law of the land means that -- I mean the biggest problem with the Budget Control Act in my view has been -- because what we've done is we've had these two year modeling through every couple of years to figure out how we're going to get the next budget out. But with the Budget Control Act still out there, you're not depending on -- not able to make any strategic discussions and decisions about programs that would be longer and more sustainable. So it becomes a bit -- since they can't make those decisions, it becomes hard for us to program our investment to support those things. We took a step forward and got out in front of the Pentagon with our big capital investment that we began back in 2015 and that has served us really well, because as long as we're executing really well, the Pentagon has able to have and the Navy in particular is able to have a discussion about okay this is going great, what else can we do? But we're still in the not sure what's going to come up next month. What I would remind is that there's always three or four tracks here to follow. And we look at this in a very binary way and say it's all nothing in the current budget cycle debate. But the reality is the current budget cycle is going-on on the hill and between the hill executive branch. In the meantime, the executive branch is actually creating the budget for next year and they're beginning the process for the budget the year after. And that is where the Budget Control Act causes problems, because it's hard to predict what the budget for 2020 is going to be if you aren't sure whether the BCA is in place or not. Our view is that there's going to be some modeling through on all of this and that we'll find a way to get through it, but it won't be a strategic way it's going to be program-by-program, ship-by-ship, activity-by-activity. And as a result, we engage basically at the program level, as I said earlier, to talk about how is the smartest way to buy the programs that we have. Doing a multi-ship procurement on aircraft carriers is the smartest way to buy aircraft carriers. Doing a -- accelerating the LXR program and connecting it to the LPD program production line is the smartest way to buy amphibs. So we're having those discussions. And because we are executing well, there's a lot of reception to those discussions. But the proof will be in how the budgets turn out. And at the end, I would say, as I said before, we can always invest a lot faster than the government can appropriate the funding. So we’ll be well positioned to invest ahead of the need from an appropriation standpoint.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Carter Copeland: Just wanted to -- couple of questions. One on technical solutions if you strip-out the Westinghouse reversal and the contribution from Camber, it looks like you were on an operating profit basis about flat there. And I wondered if that was weighed down in anyway by any expenses associated with the integration and restructuring there? Just trying to get a sense of the underlying performance?
Mike Petters: Not significantly. We still think of that businesses as starting out low single digit, driven by UPI been at about a breakeven at the current market, and any investments we’re making at SN3, so no significant or material integration or restructuring efforts.
Carter Copeland: And then another one on Engels, just wondered if you can give us some insight in terms of the underlying profitability transition there. It seems like your risk registers maybe had the most amount of upside and opportunity on NSC for a significant period of time. And it seems increasingly like that's more LPD or DDG given where those programs are today. Is that right? Do you think of it that way in terms of absolute opportunity if you perform well that’s how that's shifting, or is that just metering the net up?
Mike Petters: I guess that's a way to look at it. I'm not sure we look at it quite that way. What we’re seeing at this point is we're moving towards the backend of the NSC program, which is usually there, that’s an indication of a very mature program and we're doing very well there. LPD program, frankly, we’re doing very well there, but we're on the backend of that depending upon what happens with LXR. We're heading into a new round of competition on the Destroyer program. We are heading into a new round of -- or a new competition on Frigate program. The LHA 7 is building off lessons learned from LHA 6 going okay, and we've got eight coming behind that. So we look at each of those programs in terms of the relative maturity of that program to its overall class, right. So for instance, we’re in the submarine program and Newport News. When you’re on the backend of one of the block buys, your risk register should look -- your opportunity register should look pretty good. When you’re on the front end of the one of the block buys, there is a lot of risk in that. And that's the way we look at every one of our programs. And so if you’re coming through the end of the program, like we are with NSC, you start to move back the other way for the new program. LPD, we're not really sure what happens there because of the connection to LXR.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Sam Pearlstein: Mike, if I can just follow-up on the comment you just made about the Frigate program. Can you just talk a little bit about what that opportunity looks like, and how do you approach that differently just given some of the challenges with prior [indiscernible] program with Ingalls? And just can the Navy actually even afford to go ahead with this program? Just how do you think about it.
Mike Petters: Yes, lot questions in there. First of all, it is one of those programs that is probably in the area -- in the bubble of what happens to BCA, Budget Control Act, probably this is one of those programs, the pace of this program is probably affected by how that get's resolved from a budget standpoint. What I think that the thing that we’ve seen the Navy do over the last several years is they’ve recognized that going off to a clean sheet whiteboard and starting with the beginning of what do we want to have in this ship and creating a wish list and then trying to jam in a 10 pounds of requirements in a 5 pound stack of budget. I think they figured out that that’s not exactly the way to do business. And one of the early requirements on this Frigate is that you have to have a parent design. The parent design is a really interesting thing, because that means you're not going to a white board with a wish list of requirements, you're starting out with stuff that’s already been proven. That’s really the great connection between LPD and LXR is the decision the Navy made several years ago that the LXR is going to have the LPD hall. That’s what makes the Destroyer program work, that’s what makes Virginia class program work. And I think where the Navy is on the Frigate is a great place for them to start, but we're not going to start with a blank sheet of paper. You guys come to us with a parent design that we can then see if we can make it meet the requirements that we have for that kind of ship. That’s pretty exciting for us. We know how to do that. It's right in our lane of how do we create more capability and more investment, and accelerate the production of those ships. Our view is that time to the fleet is the biggest issue out there and in any program, at this point. And so that’s the way we’re prosecuting it.
Sam Pearlstein: And can you size that resolution with the Newport News, Chris, just in terms of the contract changes on Enterprise and Lincoln?
Mike Petters: Sure. There is approximately $25 million, and those were simply recognition of growth work on those ships, which happens from time to time and deal with our COH activity. So it was not a significant claim activity or litigation, it was just recognition of growth work within the price.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Joseph DeNardi: To maybe parse out your commentary a little bit too much, you cited strong margin, strong performance in Ingalls. You didn’t mentioned that about Newport, and I guess about back up of $25 million there, looks like margins were under 7%. So can you just talk about performance of that yard and what you're seeing there?
Mike Petters: So at Newport News, we're executing very well across all of programs. We are in that, if you go back into the history of this, the delay of the carrier because of sequestration put Newport News in a place where they’re sitting there today with a whole bunch of new programs. We're on the first half of the CVN 79, we’re the beginning of block four, we’re at the beginning of an RCOH, and we're even ahead of the beginning of Columbia class. And so in our simply operating model is that at the beginning of all these programs, the risk registers are really, really high. And so we’re very, very conservative. So that, as I’ve said many, many times, when you’re operating outside the business auto operate between 9% and 10%, if it’s healthy. If you’re executing and you’re below 9%, it means you probably have a majority of new programs. If you are executing and you are above 10%, it probably means you have a majority of very mature programs. What you’re seeing in our shipbuilding business right now is exactly that. We have a lot of new programs at Newport News, we have a lot of mature programs at Ingalls, both yards are executing exceptionally well. The Navy is working closely with us. We’re solving problems for them every day. So the partnership is a strong as I’ve ever seen in my carrier. And I’m excited about that. But we got to work through and it’s going to be a grind for a couple of years. We’ve got to work through the beginning of these programs, because they’re all long-term programs. I am excited about the team at Newport News and the things that they are doing. And is transformative for that business, it’s 130 years old, 50 years from now, people are going to look back at the team Newport News right now and say those guys change the business and drove the business forward in a way that set them up for the next 100 years. And that’s an exciting thing to be part of.
Joseph DeNardi: Chris, just on the CapEx guidance for the year, I guess it would imply it depends on what your revenue estimate for fourth quarter is. But it would imply maybe CapEx in fourth quarter of above 5% of sales. So I’m just wondering the run rate into next year? Should we think about next year’s CapEx being above that 4.5% to 5.5% and then coming down in ’19 to get to the average through 2020?
Chris Kastner: So I’ll talk about 2018 capital on the year-end call. But you’re reasonably correct that next year will be the strong year relative to capital, and then it’ll start to taper off.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is now open.
John Raviv: This is actually John Raviv on for Jason. Just a quick clarification, could you quantify that the TS benefit, how much of the 1Q reserve did you reversed out?
Chris Kastner: That’s $13 million. So when you think about the $29 million we took in the first quarter, the remainder is about $9 million.
Unidentified Analyst: And any visibility for getting that out…
Chris Kastner: No, that will be part of the bankruptcy claim, that could take a year, 18 months, or potentially not at all depending on where it results or when it resolves.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just a quick follow up on the TS business. You mentioned integration is going pretty well. When do you expect to have that -- those four units firing on all cylinders? And then at that point, what’s in the pipeline? What are some of the big opportunities we should be looking out for that you guys are going after? How much of it is recompete, how much of it is new work. And overall, how do you see organic growth shaping up with that integrated TS business?
Chris Kastner: Well, that’s a lot of questions. We expect the TS business to be firing on all cylinders right now. Actually, this week, we have a big integration milestone where we -- albeit on the same, or the majority of those businesses got on the same IT backbone. Some of the large opportunities you can look forward to or some large deal opportunities. It’s the lateral clean up contracts that is pending that we’re looking to hear about. It’s a Savannah River recompete that’s out there and then potentially the Seattle recompete as well, and the Hanford recompete as well. So we expect them to be hitting on all cylinders right now. Again, I expect that low single-digit revenue growth. I have previously said that we expect it to be a $1 billion this year. We expect that to be closer to $900 million now, driven by the [SCANA] termination, some delays in SN3 awards and then the Camber sales. So it's closer to $900 million but we think we're in a pretty good place to leap off for 2018. I don't know if I hit all your questions there.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Gautam Khanna: Couple of questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk about the CVN 79 and how it's coming down the cost curve. Obviously, we discussed since last quarter after the June GAO report. But I wanted to get a sense for your conviction level on hitting those labor rates that you're hoping to hit? And any metrics you could share with us?
Mike Petters: What I would say is that when we came off of 78, we captured a lot of lessons learned like you do from a lead ship. And we made substantial investments in new approaches based on the lessons that we learned to drive man hours out of the program. At this point, where we are as I think I pointed out that the ship is over halfway erected and then about 35% complete. The investments that we made are paying off. As we go and we track through -- we expected to get this much savings out of this investment, whether it's a new facility or a new practice or new process, we're seeing that -- we're seeing that. We're a long ways to go and we're on the front end of the assembly and test piece of the business. And so there's still lots of attention has to be paid every single day to make sure that we capture it. But I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made so far. When we made the investments that where do you expect to be when you're one third of the way through the ship, we were expecting to be where we are. And that's a pretty good thing for us and we're pleased with that. We got a lot of work to do ahead of us.
Gautam Khanna: And to that point, were there any net favorable adjustments on CVN 79 in the period?
Chris Kastner: Nothing material on that mention now.
Mike Petters: I mean, really the way we do our risk register the next big event on 79 has been for a couple of years.
Gautam Khanna: And then what were the net favorable adjustments at Ingalls in the quarter?
Chris Kastner: So total adjustments, we had 78 positive 22 negative. So net of 56% and 60% of that was Ingalls.
Gautam Khanna: And could you remind me of what the big risk retirement opportunities are in Q4 and maybe at a high level in 2018?
Mike Petters: So for the end of the year, it is obviously late in the year. But the last remaining delivery this year is DDG 114. So there is opportunity there. And I will say LPD 27 well delivered in Q3 -- the entire analysis of the work to go on that ship will not -- is not complete yet and it will complete that in Q4, so there is some opportunity on LPD 27. And then you think about deliveries, I am looking at the sub-milestones, next year we have on the first half of the year Indiana and NSC 7 and then second half DDG 117 and LHA 7.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.
Peter Skibitski: Mike, I want to ask you about top line expectations with regard to your prior expectations of flattish top line through 2020. Just in light of and maybe this is simplistic guideline is some of the incremental shipper payer orders that have come in. And I think you mentioned the Fitzgerlad, but I probably also start on Boise, and it both seemed liked very, very large repair orders. And I get a sense of maybe there is even more out there. So I'm just wondering if these incremental orders change your view of your top line, particularly in '18 and '19, and maybe you have better visibility. Could you actually maybe see some growth there because of these incremental orders? Or is that just too much within the marginal error.
Mike Petters: Yes, it's a good question. The way that I think about our shipbuilding business, you guys who’ve been for a while -- I tend to think of is being flat, because it's been historically flat. These repair jobs are -- they are not in the FCN account. They are typically funded in the O&M accounts. And they tend to be not sustainable. I mean, they’re hit or miss. There is one here and there is one there. And we do believe that there may be some opportunity for more sustainable repair, but that hasn’t sorted itself out yet. And all of that, I think one sort itself out until you get the budget piece sorted out. And if you look across our business Pete, it's not hard to figure out that if you actually move to a budget profile and plan that says we're going to 350 ship Navy then there is opportunity for growth in ship building over the next five to 10 years. But I'm just going to say until I see the budget piece get worked out on that, I'm probably not going to move off of my projection.
Peter Skibitski: And just a quick follow-up, just Chris your comments on Camber I wanted to ask about that because I was looking at your year-to-date revenues I think 239 at Camber. And I think when you bought it you said it was about call $365 million firm. So I don’t know if 4Q is expected to be really strong or maybe approving some lower margin revenue or loss something or could just maybe give some more color on Camber?
Mike Petters: We’re really pleased with the team there and the organization, and the re-compete rate. Our win rate has been very, very good. What we need to continue to focus on is the new business and the new business pipeline and new business win rate. Team is very focused on it. And we think we've got a lot of good opportunities that are filling the pipeline, which should set us up well and for 2018.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Mike just wanted to follow a bit on Newport News. So if I assume $25 million also is part of sales, even if I take it out, you still had 7% growth at Newport. So what's slows down or what was abnormally strong this quarter because I would look at 7% is somewhat above flattish?
Chris Kastner: George, I will take that one. This is Chris. It's really across the block four, starting to kick-in in CVN 79 being in full production and then CVN 73 being introduced. So it’s across the portfolio at Newport News, we have some sales growth there in the quarter.
Mike Petters: And George, I would add that when we say flat, what we’re talking about is a flat shipbuilding budget account for our shipbuilding businesses. So, you may see some growth in one part of our business with some challenges in other parts of our business. And then I would add that what you see in one particular quarter is probably not indicative of a five year trend.
George Shapiro: And then one follow-up for Chris. Will we see operating cash flow in Q4 better than the Q4 of ‘16?
Chris Kastner: Well, I’ve spoken previously about the $150 million of headwinds I have in cash or we have in cash this year compared to last year. That being said, we're working very hard to offset it. But I still see that that headwind and Q4 historically is a strong quarter for us. We expect it to be the same. So I think the best way to think about cash now is $150 million headwind, we're working very hard to offset it.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Rob Spingarn: I jumped over from another call, so hopefully I don’t ask anything that’s been asked. But I wanted to go over couple of small things that I hope were not discussed. But before that, on the back of Gautam’s question on Newport News and profitability on 79. Can that yard be 9% yard between now and when you float off that ship, 79 and 2020? Or is this 7% to 8% margin business during that period, because of 79.
Chris Kastner: I think, the way that Mike has represented is the way to think about it is total shipbuilding is 9% to 10%. I know you may be frustrated with that answer. But we're going to have quarters within in each business that is greater than 9% or less than 9%, greater than 10% or less than 10% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So it will move around a little bit. But the best way to think about it is 9% to 10% on a long-term basis.
Rob Spingarn: Well Chris, the way I think about that is simply that yes, if you're at 9% to 10% and Ingalls can hang around and may be this is another one of my questions, maybe we get another LPD. Do we get a plus up in '18? So Mike that’s a question for you, and get an LPD 30 perhaps, does Ingalls continue at an 11% to 12% type of rate offset by Newport News at 7% plus, because CVN 79 is a fixed price ship as we know, and you're booking conservatively in the beginning and therefore your blend out the 9%.
Mike Petters: So how many if's do you want to put in there…
Rob Spingarn: Actually I don’t -- the only if is the LPD 30.
Mike Petters: You centrally have CVN 79, so big milestone will be when it launches. But between now and then you’ll be finishing block three. You will be finishing or mostly finishing an RCOH and getting ready to start the next one. And so I believe Newport News can proceed better, but the macro trend at Newport News is that they’re on the front end of a bunch of new programs across all their product lines. Ingalls is, on the other hand, they’re in the mature phase and they’re in the mature phase of several programs. But just about every of their programs got a little bit of a question mark about what's the connection to the next one? Where is the NHC program going to go? How's the LPD program going to connect, you talk to that and with the -- is LPD 30, how's that fit into it. How's the timing of that fit? How does the timing of LXR start? If LXR or LPD 52 or how are we designated is at the same rhythm of the LPD program then maybe you have a material program for a while. If on the other hand, there is a delay and there is a transition and it becomes something at a little bit different rhythm because of the budget process then it may start more conservatively and that put pressure on that. So I think our point is that we’re executing really well across our business, the results that you see are the results that you would see from a business is executing really well. And as we go forward, we will take advantage of those opportunities to grab those opportunities for step ups along the way. That’s how we run the business and trying to predict more than that in the climate is probably a little bit beyond my ability.
Rob Spingarn: And if I can just ask you a couple more small things. Going back to the LPD 30, so I was going to ask you -- do you think there's a decent chance of that or we bridge to LXR from 29. It sounds from what you said before like it's still a big unknown. But is there a little bit more bias one way or the other?
Mike Petters: My personal view is I think LPD 30 ought to be the first of the next class. And an audit come-in in the time sequences that LPD 30 would come. That's what we advocate for, that's how we're talking about the smart way to move that program forward. There is a lot of chefs in that kitchen so we’ll see how that turns out. But that’s the way we see it and that’d be the best way for it to move forward for the country, for the Navy and for ourselves.
Rob Spingarn: And then just earlier, I think I was looking at the transcript you were talking about the benefit of multiyears. And I'm wondering if you have any feel for when we might see a multiyear competition for 2018, 2022 DDG 51s? And as the second part of the DDG question, are you concerned at all about the challenges or performance challenges of moving to Flight III? Or do you think those ships can be as profitable?
Mike Petters: The thing about the competition is that every time you have a competition, it resets your risk register and ultimately resets your view of the return on the program. We felt that it was really important. First of all, for the Navy to get Flight III in our hands as quick as possible, so they could start operating it and seeing what they could do with it. Secondly, we would have a chance to get build it and get it under our belt, so that we can understand where the risk in that program were. And so we went and we did -- we made an arrangement with the Navy to begin a Flight III ship in the last multiyear. We think that sets us up pretty well for the next block of ships that are coming, and that will help the Navy get the ships they need when they need to get them. It's pretty early in that and so we'll see how that plays out. But that’s our view of it. We don’t see anything that jumps out at us as being unobtainium from the standpoint of how the heck are we going to build that. So this is what the Destroyer program has been doing for decades. They’ve been doing -- they do serial production of their ships and they do block upgrades. This is just the next block upgrade.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Joseph DeNardi: Mike, just to clarify what you said on CVN 79 in terms of the risk retirement schedule, the next opportunity is in a couple of years. Just so I understand like that would be the next opportunity to recognize a favorable adjustment, but if there's cost growth on the program, you would recognize that earlier than that or would you be…
Mike Petters: If we see cost growth from the program, we don't wait. The problem with waiting is you start hoping that it'll get better. In my experience, it typically doesn't and if you wait, it starts to build up and then next thing you're breaking your legs because you have a big number instead of a small number. So we actually prosecute those things as quick as we can or we recognize those as quick as we can to head them off. And that 79 team right now is doing a very good job at that.
Chris Kastner: We evaluate those EACs every quarter.
Joseph DeNardi: And then Mike, just maybe a higher level question. You guys have obviously done a really impressive job with margins since the spin and the stock growth and the amount of value return to shareholders reflects that. But when you look at the situation at Newport now with 79 Virginia class, is that maybe the most challenging set up from a margin standpoint or risk standpoint that you faced since the spin? Or is this just normal course of business for you?
Mike Petters: Well, I mean, I think the challenge at Newport News is a good challenge to have, because there's clearly demand for that work to be done and there's opportunity for the team there to go and prosecute the demand and improve the performance of the business. But I am going to take it back to the beginning of the spin. I mean, when we spun this business out of north of Bremen, we had five ships underperforming at Ingalls. And we had five contracts that we needed to get that we did not have. That environment, in the first couple of years where -- that environment was significantly more of a challenge to us than where we are with Newport News, I mean at Newport News, we know what we got to go do there. At Ingalls back in those days, we were working through the last two ships at Avondale. We were trying to figure out how do we get the LPD program on a single production schedule and try to get it in the serial production from a production line that actually existed in two different shipyards. We were trying to get the Coastguard to move to a rhythm on national security cutters. We were actually doing a lead ship, LHA 6 with a new ship design. I don't think where we are today compares to that at all. And so I'm excited about what we can do at Newport News. I think we have a great opportunity there over the next couple of years to really set that business up for the next several decades, that's a pretty cool place to be. My team at Ingalls fought through that fight in the first couple of years after we spun out. And frankly, they have become exceptional at harvesting the mature programs that they in fact created by going to serial production on these programs. So I wouldn't say it's the most challenging now. I would go back to the beginning.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Rob Spingarn: I thought I’d jump out for the last one. But on the ITPD contract for Colombia, there is $5 billion contract that went to GD for early design work. And I don’t know if you've covered this earlier. But is there any -- can we infer from that any participation for Newport News for you and is there a way to quantify that?
Mike Petters: And we expecting award, a formal award facilitization of that in Q4. We don’t -- I haven't published the qualification of that as of yet, but we will participate.
Rob Spingarn: And when would that work start to ramp?
Mike Petters: I mean, it's basically the ramp-up has already begun on Columbia and this just continues at over the next couple of years. This is all the work that has to be done ahead of the -- for ship [multiple speakers] 2021, if you want to try to lay it in there.
Rob Spingarn: Just trying to figure out, I mean it's a significant piece of business. Obviously, the program is very significant. But from revenue perspective and you've talked about the top line quite a bit on today's call. But is this something we're going to notice?
Mike Petters: It becomes more significant as you move to the next couple of years towards 2021 for sure.
Rob Spingarn: Okay, thank you.
Mike Petters: And I just would add, this work is actually at least as important as the first piece of building that we do in the fabrication. This is where we are actually getting the design sorted out. We’re figuring on how we’re going to build it, all of those things. And a lot of decisions that are being made right now will drive the effectiveness and efficiency of the construction. So it's been a very important contract. It's a very important step forward by the program. It's very important that that program continue to be funded in this space. And Rob, I think you and I’ve talked a little bit about, sometimes there is a view that while it's just design work, maybe we it's fungible, we can move it around. You really shouldn’t be moving this money around politically from a budget standpoint. This is critical that this stay on track.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Gautam Khanna: First of all, I just want to make sure I have this right. Tax rate for the year, implies a pretty steep step up in Q4. Is that correct?
Chris Kastner: Not really. It's 30% to 32%. So I think we’re cum to-date around 29%, so not a significant step up now.
Gautam Khanna: I just also want to be clear. In terms of the fiscal '19 budget request, what are the main things that or big opportunities for you guys. What is that that you’re looking for? Is this the LXR getting pulled forward or is it, the stuff you talked about in the script. I'm just curious, what is the full case that we should be hoping for in terms of programmatic moves.
Chris Kastner: Yes, I think at the very first in line is a decision to move out on a multi-ship procurement for aircraft carriers. There is a lot of discussion about that. There is a lot of work being done on it. It's an influence in the discussion around the FY18 budget at this point. But to actually do that, you actually have to start moving towards creating the contract to do it. You got to start creating the arrangements with the supply chain to get it done. And so that’s really the first thing inline that I think needs to be done. Frankly, if we don’t get something in the '18 authorization and appropriation, it starts to cut into amount of savings you could get from the two ship procurement. Behind that, I think it’s the LXR. I think getting the amphibs in sequence and getting a move forward, those are -- that’s a great opportunity for the Navy to get ships to the fleet faster and more affordably. And I really think that that is the next thing in line. And from there, I think we head down the normal course of business, block 5 is coming, the next multiyear on Destroyers are coming, and the rest of the business starts to fall in the place. But those are the two big things is the amphibs that we carry.
Gautam Khanna: And on the DDG multi-year buy, is that still expected sometime in June of next year, something like that?
Mike Petters: Yes, I think that’s on schedule.
Gautam Khanna: And DCS block 5, when should we expect that?
Mike Petters: A lot of work in '18, but it's probably '19 [multiple speakers]…
Gautam Khanna: And of course the debate there is three year. And then lastly, icebreakers. What do you expecting if anything by movement there?
Mike Petters: Well, we're engaged in that program and watching it as it moves forward. And we expect to respond and engage in -- I think, we built the last one. So we’re staying very to the Coast Guard on that.
Chris Kastner: And that’s probably 2019…
Gautam Khanna: And in terms of the budget, are we -- should we be looking out for anything specific on icebreaker in the ’19 request?
Mike Petters: Well, scheduled to be awarded in '19. So we need to be funds.
Operator: And I’m showing no further questions at this time. So with that, I would like to turn the call back over to CEO, Mr. Mike Petters for closing remarks.
Mike Petters: Well, thanks to everybody for joining with us today. As you can tell from our results and our discussion, we're executing. We continue to execute well. Our financial results are very solid. We remain committed to our cash deployment strategy. Our teams are focusing on safety, quality, cost and schedule. And we appreciate your interest in our business and we look forward to seeing you wherever we might bump into each other. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-08-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today’s conference Mr. Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Derrick. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries’ second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President of Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also, in their remarks today, Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including certain segment and adjusted financial measures.

We plan to address the posted presentation slide during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation, as well as our earnings release. With that, I’ll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today’s call. We released our second quarter results this morning that reflect solid performance across the enterprise. So let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Page 3 of the presentation. Sales of $1.86 billion were up 9.3% from last year. Diluted EPS was $3.21 and operating cash was $186 million for the quarter. Additionally, we received $3.4 billion in new contracts, including $3 billion for detail design and construction of LHA 8 Bougainville, and $218 million for long lead material in advance construction activities for LPD 29. As a result, backlog was approximately $21.1 billion at the end of the quarter of which $14 billion is funded. Regarding activities in Washington, we were honored to participate in a shipbuilding hearing before the Senate and Armed Services Committee, Seapower Subcommittee, this past May, where we advocated for stable and predictable funding for shipbuilding as well as an end to sequestration. The hearing also afforded an opportunity to highlight the inherent efficiencies and cost savings of leveraging high production lines and multiship procurement strategies for Ford-class Aircraft Carriers, LPD 17 class amphibi ships and DDG 51 Class Destroyers. We are pleased with the progress being made by the defense authorizing and appropriating committees in Congress with regard to the fiscal year 2018 budget and I encouraged by the support for Navy shipbuilding in various builds. As the administration complete its national defense strategy review this summer, we look forward to seeing how results will shape the fiscal year 2019 President’s Budget as well as the future year defense program. However, looming over all of this is the Budget Control Act, which remains a lot of land as well as the need to determine how Columbia-class submarines will be funded without impacting other critically important shipbuilding priorities. Now I’ll provide a few points of interest on our business segments. Ingalls launched LHA 7 AAA in May and conducted very successful builders’ trials on LPD 27 Portland at the end of June with plans to complete acceptance trials and deliver the ship to the Navy by the end of the year. The team also recently completed builders trials on DDG 114 Ralph Johnson and plans to complete acceptance trials and deliver the ship to the Navy by the end of this year. In addition the team receive the modification to the 2013 DDG multi-year contract that incorporates the Flight 3 radar system upgrades on DDG 125. At Newport News, this was a very busy quarter, as a team successfully delivered CVN 78 Ford and SSN 787 Washington and redelivered CVN 72 Lincoln to the Navy within a 19 days span. CVN 79 Kennedy achieved 50% structural completion, a significant milestone in the construction of the ship. In addition SSN 789 Indiana was launched and is preparing for its plan delivery to the Navy early next year. And in July, the team reached agreement on a 52-month contract with United Steelworkers of America as largest bargaining unit. Turning to Technical Solutions, its nuclear and environmental group is a part of the team that won the competition to provide management and operating services at the Nevada National Security Site. In addition its fleet support group was awarded the task order to perform a special selected restricted availability on CG 65, USS Chosin, and is also teaming with Boeing to pursue design and production of the Navy’s extra-large, unmanned, undersea vehicle. In closing, I’m pleased with the program execution and financial performance for the first half of the year and we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business. The shipbuilding segments continue to invest in capital projects to increase efficiency and affordability while Technical Solutions segment focuses on the integration process and securing key contract awards has strengthened its book of business. All of these actions support the framework for long-term sustainable value creation for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. That concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Today, I will review our second quarter consolidated and segment results as well as provide you with a few updates for the second half of the year, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter of $1.86 billion, increased 9.3% over second quarter 2016 due to higher volumes at Ingalls and acquisition of Camber, which contributed approximately $85 million. Operating income for the quarter of $237 million, increased $20 million or 9.2% for the second quarter of 2016, primarily driven by the FAS/CAS Adjustment. Operating margin of 12.8% was similar to second quarter 2016. Turning to Slide 5 of the presentation. Cash from operations was $1.86 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $107 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $79 million or 4.3% of revenues, compared to $48 million in second quarter 2016. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be between 4.5% and 5.5% of revenues. Additionally, year-to-date we’ve made $91 million of discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plan, and we plan to contribute the remaining discretionary balance in the third quarter. We also repurchased approximately 708,000 shares in the quarter, at a cost of $138 million. Bringing the balance remaining in our share repurchase program to approximately $306 million and paid dividends of $0.60 per share or $27 million bringing our quarter end cash balance to $553 million. We remain committed to returning substantially all our free cash flow to shareholders through 2020. Before I go to into the segment results, let me briefly discuss our credit rating. During the quarter, Fitch, affirmed its BB+ corporate credit rating of HII and raised its outlook from stable to positive. Following Moody’s affirmation of its Ba1 corporate credit rating and positive outlook position published in the first quarter. We believe that these developments are a natural evolution for the business as we have maintained investment-grade credit metrics for the past two years, driven by strong operational performance, cash generation and a measured deleveraging. We intend to continue to manage the business with the financial policy that is consistent with an investment-grade credit rating. Turning to segments – Slide 6 of the presentation, Ingalls revenues in the quarter were $639 million increased 9.2% from the same period last year driven by higher volumes on the LHA and NSC programs, partially offset by lower volume on the LPD program. Ingalls segment operating income of $98 million and margin of 15.3% in the quarter were up $10 million and 11% year-over-year respectively, primarily due to higher risk retirement on the LHA and NSC programs, partially offset by lower risk retirement on the LPD programs. On Slide 7 of the presentation, Newport News revenues of $1 billion in the quarter were similar to revenues in second quarter 2016. Newport News operating income was $80 million in the quarter with operating margin of 8%. Operating income was down $18 million and operating margin down 18% year-over-year, primarily due to lower risk retirement on the VCS program. Now that Technical Solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation. Revenues of $244 million in the quarter increased 71% from the same period last year, primarily due to the acquisition of Camber and improvement in the oil and gas services business. Technical Solutions operating income of $9 million in the quarter increased $11 million from second quarter 2016, primarily due to improved performance in the oil and gas services business and the acquisition of Camber. Additionally, regarding the Westinghouse bankruptcy, we received cash for a portion of the pre-bankruptcy cost incurred and made an adjustment to the first quarter reserve resulting in net margin benefit of approximately $3 million. As you recall, we took a $29 million reserve in the first quarter for cost incurred due March 29, 2017, the bankruptcy filing date. We’ve been operating under interim assessment agreement with Georgia and South Carolina facility owners, and have been paid for all post bankruptcy cost incurred to the end of June. We also expect to be paid for the cost incurred in July. As you may be aware, the South Carolina utility owners decided to seize construction on both new nuclear units. While we’re disappointed in this decision, we expect cost incurred for the termination date to be paid under the provisions of the Westinghouse interim assessment agreement. Other liabilities that we have incurred for the South Carolina facility will be subject to bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, the bankruptcy court has approved an agreement on pre-bankruptcy cost for the Georgia plant. And we expect to receive payment for the remaining Georgia pre-bankruptcy cost incurred in the third quarter. In addition, let me give you an update on Avondale. We signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of the property. While this is a positive step toward an eventual sale, a comprehensive due diligence progress will now be initiated before the potential buyer is obligated to close. Now, for some below the line items for 2017. We continue to expect a favorable FAS/CAS Adjustment for 2017 of $198 million, a non-current state income tax expense to be in the $5 million to $10 million range. We still expect interest expense of $70 million for the year and the effective income tax rate to be in the 30% to 32% range. That concludes my remarks. I’ll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people for the queue as possible. Derrick, I’ll turn the call over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning. Hey, guys.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Quick follow-up on what you just said on Avondale. Is there particular cash impact we should expect if and when that closes? And then I have a question Mike, for you on LCS.
Chris Kastner: So regarding Avondale, the terms of that deal, that purchase and sale agreement are not disclosed at this point. We have a long way to go in the due diligence process, it could take a few months here. So that’s going to take a bit of time to resolve. It’s a positive first step. But we really will know that will be done until it’s done. From a cash standpoint, as you know to Avondale sale is part of the restructuring proposal that we have going on with the Navy. So whether could be some initial cash pickup before the end of year based on the terms of the deal, we would be obligated to provide some of that back to our overhead rates.
Robert Spingarn: Right, okay. Thanks for that, Chris. Mike, on LCS, it looks like there is going to be a follow-up program here at FGX. That sounds like it will be a single winter 2020 timeframe for the award. Is this something that you guys are interested in? And how should we think about that opportunity?
Chris Kastner: I a word, yes, we are interested in that program. We participated in the industry discussions that have been going on so far. We have advocated that the National Security Cutter could be a good small frigate. That’s a possibility. We’ll have to see if that’s how the requirements shape out and if that even make sense. The Navy program looks like it’s going to be driven by how quickly you can get a ship to the fleet. And so we’re actually pretty good at getting ships to the fleet. So we think we have a fighter’s chance and we’re really interested in the program.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then just lastly Chris, one other thing, on Ford, was there a profit pickup in Q2 or is that Q3 or is just wasn’t one? Just given the margin its important is?
Chris Kastner: There was no material adjustment within the quarter related to the Ford.
Robert Spingarn: Okay, and you don’t expect one?
Chris Kastner: No, I don’t.
Robert Spingarn: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Strauss from UBS. Your line is open.
David Strauss: Thanks, good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
David Strauss: Mike, could you give us a bit of more of an update on Kennedy, you talked about being 50% structurally complete, but some stuff out there in the news this quarter around cost production on it, just an update there?
Mike Petters: Sure. We are 50% structurally complete, if you look in the dry dock you can make out kind of a whole bottom key area of ship, it’s looking like a ship now. We will start building skyline here before too long. In the quarter, you referenced some news. I mean what happened during the quarter is that GAO put out a report, which really compared 79 Kennedy to the Ford in terms of the way the cost was allocated in the shipyard. I think that’s a pretty useful report from the standpoint of saying here is a way to look at what’s happening on Ford – between what happens on Ford and what happens on Kennedy. The fact is that when we went to contract on Kennedy, we took a pretty significant reduction in the man hours between Kennedy and Ford. And we can go and kind of quibble about which hours are in there report or not. But I think it’s useful to think in the main they got that right. There is a pretty significant reduction of man hours between Ford and Kennedy. And I think their perspective was that this is bigger than anything we’ve ever seen in carriers. And we agree in the main, we agree with all of that. It is bigger than anything we’ve ever seen before. We did take that reduction in the target. And now let’s talk about why took that reduction and why we have confidence in what we’re doing. As we went into Ford, we were operating for the first time. We were operating with a digital design and a 3D product model. But it was not complete when we started that ship. As we started the Kennedy, the model was complete. When we started the Ford, as we went through that project, the bill of material because the design wasn’t complete, the bill of material wasn’t complete. And so as we go into Kennedy, not only is the design complete but the bill of material is complete. Those two factors alone will drive reductions in the cost of the program that we think are fairly significant. Beyond that, what’s happening on the ship is that, as you went through the first ship of a class is a prototype. And we talked about how the first production unit is the prototype and how that’s different than a lot of folks who build prototypes and then go to production after they build the prototypes. In this particular case, from the very first-day of cutting the very first purchase order for equipment on the Ford, we began the process of saying how can we do this better. And we collected whether it was in purchasing or in engineering or in manufacturing or in assembly, down in the ship, we collected those lessons learned and we brought those back and we basically tested our labor plan, our production plan, our sourcing plan, and our engineering plan. And where we felt we could make improvements, we incorporated those into the master schedule for the 79. So as you’re going through this and you are going through testing the prototype, the computer tells you as an example of what – of the difference that pops up, the computer will tell you, you need to put a hole in this plate, in this spot. So the craftsman will look at that and say well, okay, but I want to go, check that. And they’re going to go verify it, and they’re going to validate it, and they’re going to look at it three ways to Sunday and say, okay, now I believe that the whole goes in that spot. That’s a kind of stuff that happens on Ford. When you go to Kennedy, the craftsman says, the computer said to put the hole in that spot, I’m going to go put the hole in that spot. I know its right, because it was right on Ford. So we think if there is a lot of that kind of prototype cost that can be shed between in terms of the labor and the man hours that go to into the program. We felt confident enough about that not only to capture it and build the ship that way, but the contract Ford. So where do we stand? So far so good. We’re 50% erect, on the ship. We are beginning the – really cutting the loose the man hours, now. We’ve got a lot of man hours in front of us, but so far so good. We’re basically on track with our plan. And we’re very confident that we have – that we’re going to make a very, very significant labor cost reduction between Kennedy and Ford. And then, we will be talking about that I’m sure every quarter for the next five or six years.
David Strauss: Right, thanks that’s terrific color. As a follow up just wanted to ask about how you’re thinking about the growth in the shipbuilding business going forward as a whole. I think this quarter you did about 4% growth in the shipbuilding businesses. As I look at the account SCN account it is grown by 25% or so over the last couple of years. I think last, I heard from you guys, you were still talking flattish, just how you’re thinking about the revenue profile from here? Thanks.
Chris Kastner: I think if you, if you buy into the 355 ship Navy, you can talk yourself into a pretty aggressive growth profile. We’re at the place where we’re saying until sequestration is taken care of and we’ve its a kind of show us the money sort of perspective. And without that and without that getting sorted out, we are going to stick to our guns and say the history of SCN account that it’s reasonably flat. My concern is that if you find another way to pay for the Columbia class, then it won’t be flat. Then there will be growth in the profile. But if you don’t find a way to pay for the Columbia class, you’re going to take it out of hide and you are going to take it out of other ships. So our view is that we’re making pretty significant capital investment in our business and we’ve talked about how generational that is. That capital investment is to support the flat plan. If we see a break loose on heading up towards 355 ships and we get some confidence in that, we will be talking about more capital investment. So our view is that we are optimistic, we are hopeful, everybody’s saying all the right stuff. But we got some real tough things to get over. The budget control act is a big deal that we’ve got to get over, before everybody can go about and do this the right way. So that’s – we’re going to stick to our guns and say plan on flat. Hope for the best.
David Strauss: Thanks appreciate the color.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning, first quick one for you Christy. The Ingalls margin seems abnormally high. You know it was about last year, and last year you got a big benefit from LPD delivery. So can you give us what the EACs were or and/or if there is something unique in the EAC for Ingalls this quarter?
Chris Kastner: Yeah George thanks for the question. The unique thing that happened at Ingalls, this quarter, it’s becoming less unique and more run rate is they had a very high quality launch related to LHA-7. It’s actually ahead of schedule and they were able to retire about $30 million of risk. So it was driven by high-quality LHA-7 launch.
George Shapiro: Okay and could you just tell us how much – what the favorable and unfavorable EACs were I guess, we’ll see it in the Q in a little while.
Chris Kastner: Well, I’ll just tell you. It is positive 88, it negative 28 for a net of 60. And about 85% of that net is driven by Ingalls.
George Shapiro: And then one for you Mike, can you tell us where you think we are in terms of what you have talked about as the Newport News best up for this year.
Mike Petters: I don’t think, I think Newport News is in a phase right now that’s more than a year. I think Newport News is at the beginning of CVN-79. We go to launch that ship in 2020. So that’s really the first big major milestone on 79 that effects the way that we rationalize our risk registers. We are just now going to be this quarter, we are going to be the beginning the next refueling overhaul. We are beginning construction on the Block IV. We’re going to be heading into negotiations on Block V for the Virginia Class. And we’re beginning Columbia. So if you look across Newport News, they’ve got, those are all really good solid great programs with long-runs, ahead of them. But this next time period at Newport News is going to be starting up. And in the middle of that, we are going to be digitizing the shipyard. And so to give us a chance to really be successful on these long, long runs that we have in front of us and takes some significant cost out. So this is not just a one year event at Newport News, this is going to be a phase that they are going to go through. And I’m really happy with the team that’s there, the way they are working on their programs, and executing exceptionally well on all of their programs. And three deliveries in 19 days is pretty phenomenal. So I’m pretty excited about where that business is going to go. And it’s going to be set up for a very, very bright future. But we got to go through some through a little phase of time here that’s going to be a grind.
George Shapiro: Okay thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Sam Pearlstein: Hi good mornings, you recently got the DDG contract for the Flight 3 upgrade. I guess just trying to think about what do you do differently to make you think differently about the starting margin on that ship versus other DDG starts?
Chris Kastner: Sam this is Chris, we assess the risk on each ship when we start out. And the risk on that is a bit different, obviously, from the Flight 2. So the beginning margin rate could be less. But that’s an assessment we make on each ship when we start the program.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay, and now with the LPD-29 advanced construction, does that get you the bridge to LXR, or do you still need anything more in order to fill that gap?
Chris Kastner: That depends on when LXR happens. If the assumption is that it’s going to happen in 2019, then we’re probably getting pretty close. If you take LXR and you build a write-off of LPD-29 and it’s next one, the optimum time would be sooner than that. But I think to me this is part of the discussion around how do you find Columbia. Because I think unfortunately, I think LXR becomes one of those things that could be affected by the failure to figure out how to fund Columbia. And that’s why we keep bringing that up as – you can’t just go and throw all these programs out there. They’re going to start bumping into each other unless you figure out how to get through sequestration.
Sam Pearlstein: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Peter Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
Peter Skibitski: Yeah Mike, wondered if you could, ringing into the DC debate a little bit, and just discuss, in terms of your discussion there, how would you handicap the likelihood of getting the BCA work around deal, because it seems like some of the Senate Democrats have kind of pulled up a flag to say hey, here is one potential work around. So is that a positive thing? Would you handicap it at better than the 50% that we do get a workaround?
Mike Petters: My, this is just one man’s opinion here. I think the first of all the discussion that’s going on around the BCA, of what’s the real requirement for security. What are the things we need to be able to do? What’s the world look like? All of the things are driving folks to recognize that the budget control act is not helpful. You kind of look at, any dimension you look at it through, any lens you look at – you kind of come to that conclusion. And just about everybody I talk to says, we really shouldn’t be operating this. But now how do you get it changed? And how do you get it get undone? My guess is, it probably looks a little bit like what we’ve done in the past. That there will be some kind of another Ryan Murray deal. I don’t think that’s the right answer. Let me be clear about that. When you only do these two year fixes, you’re not able to do the strategic decision-making that this country needs to make on behalf of any dimension, whether its security or some other dimension that you’re looking at. You can’t think strategically when you have basically a two-year deal. Having said that, a two-year deal is better than no deal. So I would say right now, if I had to lay a wager, as we get to the end game, there’s going to be some discussion of some way to put together a deal, that’s going to make some of this happen. And we’ll see and will stay engaged.
Peter Skibitski: Okay got I got it. Thank you for that. And then can you give us some details on that Nevada test site when just in terms of what’s your participation in the JV? What kind of margin or even just the level we should model in?
Mike Petters: Well, its 23%. It could be – it’s a 10-year program, $500 million or – excuse me, $5 billion over 23% of that. So on an annualized basis, it’s probably south of $10 million a year.
Peter Skibitski: All right, thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Jason Gursky: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Jason Gursky: Hey Mike, Mike, I just wondering if you could spend a few minutes talking about unmanned undersea. Where your capabilities are at this point? And then kind of what you view the future to be in unmanned undersea, kind of the – this potential size of the opportunity there? And maybe talk a little bit about some of the key milestones that you’re looking for either from your technical capabilities or from the customer? And when we might begin seeing this become a bit more of a meaningful portion of your revenue stream?
Mike Petters: Yes, good question. Conceptually, we’ve had a view towards this space for a while now. And a couple of years ago, we acquired the undersea group from Columbia, that had a working manned and unmanned undersea vehicle called Proteus. And we’ve shopped that around and we showed folks that, that was a very small acquisition, but that opened up a whole lot of doors to customers that we really didn’t great access to before that. And it’s created an opportunity to partner in ways that may be we couldn’t partner before. We have tremendous undersea capability in our submarine construction program. Then I would say that second to none. But building submarines, where you are going to take people into the environment of the sea is different than building an unmanned vehicle. That’s just a – it’s a very different thing. The physics are all the same, but the difference between carrying a person and not carrying a person is dramatic. And it really creates a whole different set of customers and whole different set of requirements. So we felt like we needed to get some more knowledge in there. And so bringing those guys on from Panama City was a huge even though as a small acquisition on our part, it was a huge change in our company. Because it gave us chance to go and really engage in that space. And so we’ve been engaging in that space as the programs have come through. The first go around on the LD UUV, we were very involved in that, when that program moved to the side. And now, the Navy’s gone forward with this XL UUV program. We’ve actually been – we’ve actually teamed with Boeing to participate in that program. And we are very, very excited about the chance to work with the company like Boeing that’s got a long history in this space. And I think they are excited that they have access to some of our technical capability as well. So we’re excited about that. And we’re excited about where that could lead – where that might go for the future. As far as the size of this market, you can – it’s kind of hard to size it. But you could go back and take the UAV marketplace back to 20, 25 years ago. And I’ve seen the curves that say here’s what happened with UAV, it’s kind of flat for a while and then it turned and went up. And I don’t know where we are on the curve around UUVs. I was a submarine guy, I can tell you for sure that the thing about being underwater is very different than being in the air. It’s a different set of engineering and engineering challenges to solve. I can’t say for sure that the curve is going to go up in the way that the UAV curve did. But we are taken out of position in the front end of this program. And it’s been a strategic emphasis for us for the last three years or four years to go figure out how to get in on the front end of this thing. We’re excited about our position now. And when that curve does hit the knee and start to accelerate up, we expect to be a pretty big player in it. As far as trying to size it, I think, I don’t know – actually I know how to size that yet. It’s a really big strategic thrust for us.
Jason Gursky: Okay, that’s great. Thanks. And then as the follow-up question here on the Technical Solutions side of things. Over the past couple of years, you’ve talked about some of the growth opportunities there. Can you maybe just provide us quick update on the various initiatives that you had going on there from a growth perspective? Thanks.
Mike Petters: Sure. The first thing to understand about Technical Solutions is that when we acquired Camber, we actually didn’t felt we had the critical mass or we have separating this business away from the shipbuilding business and creating the third business unit. The reason we wanted to do that was because the way those, everybody that’s in the Technical Solutions division, the way that they compete is fundamentally different than the way we compete in shipbuilding. The style of competition is very different, the magnitude and the quantity of the customers that are out there are very different. And so how you go to the market is very different. It’s consistent across that division now. They fundamentally go to market the same way but this slight of customers is tremendously large compared to the customers that we have in shipbuilding. And the style of contracts and the style of competitions are very different. Behind that though is there is a fundamental reliance on the shipbuilding business to support the Technical Solutions team. We believe that there is great – we’ve had a historic relationship between our fleet support group the folks at AMSEC historically and the folks at Continental Maritime, their relationship back to shipbuilding kind of make sense. I mean big navy customers, big navy support around the world and that continues. But then you turn to our effort in the DOE space and we talked about being, we’ve been working with floor at the Savannah Riverside floor over a decade now. But we’ve never really been able to kind of grow that business in any way. And we’ve now moved this to the place where we have been part of the winning team in the Nevada test site. And we see the Department of Energy has a lot of those kinds of programs in front of it over the next 10 years. And we expect to be a bigger player. We’re certainly going to be a bigger player in that than we have been in the past. And we expect that the ability now to connect the tremendous technical capability at the shipyard to those customers at the Department of Energy is going to be something that we’re going to be getting better and better at. And that’s going to give us a chance to grow that piece of the business. Camber comes in with a whole set of customers that we have very little – a whole lot of government customers that we –without Camber had a very little experience with. And in the mean – in the main though Camber also had a pretty substantial navy business. And Camber and AMSEC found themselves in places now where they are able to bridge stuff that neither of one them could did before. And so we’re excited about that opportunity. And we’ve kind of gone through all of the pain of the oil and gas space. We have another business in at UniversalPegasus that competes and goes to market the same day as those other folks too. Their customers are not in the government typically. And that’s healthy for my business as well. And they have kind of gone through the pain and they’re starting to really capture their share of the work now and move ahead. So we believe the Technical Solutions is really well positioned to take advantage of the growth in both government services and the potential for growth over in the oil and gas space. And we’re excited about that. Our businesses are leaning back and forth between Technical Solutions and our shipbuilding business to make sure that we are able to present those tremendous capabilities that we have to the vast amount of customers that we have now compared to what we had six years ago.
Jason Gursky: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Myles Walton: I was hoping that follow-up, I mean maybe a clarification on TS first. I think, Chris, you said that there was a $3 million reversal. I’m just kind of thinking sequentially, the margins in TS or EBIT contribution in TS, looks like clean extra charge in 1Q would have been $11 million clean ex-reversal I guess would have been $6 million sequentially despite a higher volume. Can you talk to the mix there and also where you are relative to the 5% to 7% long range margin target?
Chris Kastner: Yes, so notwithstanding what’s going on with the Westinghouse bankruptcy and how that eventually shakes out. We still think 2017 could be low single-digits, subject to the bankruptcy and how that flows through. And then, we believe we are on page to get to 5% to 7% by 2020.
Myles Walton: Okay. And then Mike or Chris I don’t know which, in terms of the Avondale restructuring and shut down the claim. I know that you’re going through the DOD side of contracts claims at this point. How key is this P&L to that process and kind of a pathway to recovering that $300 million or so in the restructuring and shutdown?
Chris Kastner: It really isn’t. There’s an assumption made within the restructuring proposal for an ultimate disposition. So while it may modify the ultimate value of debt, it doesn’t really impact it.
Myles Walton: What’s the timeline of your current claim?
Chris Kastner: That could carry on 12 to 24 months. We are still negotiating informally with the navy to try to get resolution. But that could take a year to year and a half to year or two years.
Myles Walton: Oaky, I’ll leave it with you. Thanks.
Chris Kastner: Thanks, Myles.
Operator: And our next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Doug Harned: Yes, good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Doug Harned: If we go back to CVN 79, the Kennedy, let’s – if you think about most of your mature programs on fixed price contracts, these sent to be double-digit margins. And this is obviously the first fixed price contract of this class. But if you look at it and think about if you stay on plan, is this a ship that you could do a double-digit margin on?
Mike Petters: Well, let me just say, Doug, we are talking about a program that’s going to play out over the next six years or so, five years anyway. And could we? Sure. Are we retargeting that? You bet. Is there a lot of work to do between now and then? Absolutely. So we’re watching it, we’re working it, we are engaged in it. We certainly are pushing hard for that outcome.
Doug Harned: And this is so – that’s good to hear. So this is something that you’re going to see how this evolves over time as you reduce risk and hopefully you can get there on this one.
Mike Petters: Just like we do on every other program.
Doug Harned: I just also wanted to ask on the budget, we have obviously as you described a whole range of scenarios here with some pretty attractive budgets, I would say, from a shipbuilding standpoint, if you look at what’s in the house committees down to what if we have no debt ceiling relief, what if, you can’t do anything about BCA. When you look forward to the investments that you would need to make, should we ramp up the shipbuilding outlook, what do you look for as the trigger or when you can start to make some of those investments looking at some possible growth?
Mike Petters: Yes, I’m not – yes, Doug, that’s a really good question. I’m not sure there is a single light switch that I’m going to say, if they fix that then we are often running. I would tell you that if they were to and the best of all universes, if somebody decided to just figure out how to make sequestration go away. That will be a pretty big indicator because the driver for that would be the requirements are just getting to be so loud that we got to go do something different than we are doing. But that’s probably the biggest indicators, watching how – how do we maneuver our way through that. If we do another two-year deal, that’s probably – that’s not as good as making it go away, but that’s better than not doing it. How this discussion goes on the debt ceiling will be watching that. And all of that goes into the soup as we start to make our decisions. The advantage we have is that we can actually start to deploy our capital ahead of the navy’s decision to buy ships. And so because we get to watch and see how these other things happen in the appropriations process. And we’ll be able to stay ahead of that. And we can throttle that and measure that based on our assessment of the terrain at that point in time. Our assessment right now is, it’s too early for us to get out in front of our headlights and start investing again from 355 ship Navy. It’s not too early to continually investment that we’re making to support the 300 ship Navy.
Chris Kastner: Doug, I’d like to add tactically, the RFP for DDG 51 the quantity and the pace of those. And then the Block 5 DCS RFP should show up later this year. And that will give us some indication of how quickly they want to buy those ships.
Mike Petters: Yes, that’s true. And if the Congress gave the Navy to the authority to procure more than one aircraft carrier, we see that as a really big signal. I don’t believe the Congress could do that without having some solution to the BCA. But if certainly, if we sit down and start negotiating with the Navy instead of the CV and 80 contract, we are negotiating two carriers or three carriers, we are going to be a whole lot more inclined to go and invest against the 355 ship Navy. And I will tell you, Doug, that our suppliers will be a whole lot more inclined to it than too.
Doug Harned: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Matt Porat: Hey, good morning, it’s Matt Porat on for Noah.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Chris Kastner: Good morning.
Matt Porat: So I just wanted to sort of go back to TS for a moment. You have talked about some of the synergies from the sales standpoint. And I was looking to get a bit of better sense for some of the leverage you are looking to pull to sort of see those margins track a little higher?
Chris Kastner: Actually, there will be a natural growth in those margins based upon getting some result in the nuclear sector and winning deal, we were if you saw the first win within Nevada test site, so the investments we’re making within the TS, if those yield, some wins. And then, really getting the cost structure squared away in oil and gas, they had a fairly good first quarter where they essentially broke even. And if there’s a lift in that market that could potentially show some growth as well.
Matt Porat: Got you. And what kind of growth are you kind of looking at from vessel package system Ford here?
Mike Petters: We’re talking about low-single digit for the entire TS space.
Matt Porat: Got it. Thanks so much.
Mike Petters: Yes.
Operator: And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Gautam Khanna: Yes, thanks. Great results at Ingalls.
Mike Petters: Thank you.
Gautam Khanna: So you mentioned Ingalls has been kind of out performing for while now, which is obvious. I guess the question is, are there any other kind of major risk retirement events as you move through the rest of this year and into 2018 that we can look for as potential risk retirement events that could be a significant as what we saw in Q2?
Mike Petters: That’s a good question. I’d indicated previously I thought margin would be a bit backend loaded for this year. Fortunately, Ingalls had a very good Q2 related to that quality launch in LHA 7. So I really think the best way to think about shipbuilding is 9% to 10% return on sales for the balance of the year.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And then when we look into next to previously guidance you talked about on CVN 79, that there’s no major risk retirement opportunities through 2020, I believe. Just want an updated view on that?
Mike Petters: No, the launch for CVN 79 is 2020 and there is really no significant risk retirement milestone until then for CVN 79.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And then just any comments on where we stand with the icebreaker competition in RFP that, what you expectations for the program?
Mike Petters: Well, I mean we are very interested in the program and we’re engaged in the studies that are going on right now to as the program begins to take shape. I think it’s going to take a little bit to work its way through. Obviously, the more complex the platform needs to be, the more likely we are to be a major player and trying to sort through it. We think icebreakers tend to be really complex platforms and so we are excited to be the part of the program. And we’re putting our best foot forward.
Gautam Khanna: You have assumptions and timing of that program?
Mike Petters: At this point, it’s moved a little bit faster than I would’ve thought. But I think that program is also going to be driven by from a timing perspective. It’s going to be driven by all of the other budget discussions that are going on. There’s a lot of stuff that could move faster if we get the budget stuff out of the way. This would certainly one of them.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And last one for me, Chris, any preliminary view on cash pension for 2018?
Chris Kastner: No. Gautam, thanks for the question. It’s a bit too early from contributions or cash pension in 2018. I’ll be able to provide you more color if we get towards the end of the year.
Gautam Khanna: Thanks, guys.
Chris Kastner: You’re welcome.
Operator: And at this time, I’m showing no further questions.
Mike Petters: Okay. Well, thanks to everybody for joining us on today’s call. We’re excited about what’s happening in our business. And we’re looking forward to creating more and more value doing hard stuff and getting it done right for a lot of customers. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-05-04 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce our to Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks Ashley. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries first quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks Dwayne. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. Our first quarter results reflect solid performance in shipbuilding, while technical solutions absorb the impact of the reserve book for work performed by their nuclear and environmental group for Westinghouse. Chris will provide some additional color on this topic during his remarks. Before I get into highlights for the quarter, let me talk about the leadership change we announced yesterday. Matt Mulherin, President of Newport News Shipbuilding will retire on August 1 after more than 36 years of service. Matt's career as Newport News has been remarkable and HII would not be the successful company it is today were it not for Matt's leadership. With Matt retiring, we also announced that Jennifer Boykin will succeed Matt beginning July 1 as the new President of Newport News Shipbuilding and will join my team. Jennifer has been at Newport News since 1987 and has proven herself to be a strategic and visionary leader focused on operational success. I am extremely confident that shipyard will be in very capable hands. So now let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Page 3 of the presentation. Sales of $1.7 billion were down 2.2% from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.56 and operating cash was $98 million for the quarter. Additionally, we received $600 million in new contract awards, resulting in backlog of approximately $20 billion at the end of the quarter of which $12.7 billion is funded. As you know, we hosted President Trump the Secretary of Defense and the Chief of Naval Operations on Board CVN 78 forward back in March. Is always an honor to host the Commander-in-Chief, the Secretary and CNO in our facilities and we were encouraged by the President stated commitment to a 12-carrier fleet. And while this is great news, we recognize that aircraft carriers and most other capital ships are funded across several budget cycles. We're encouraged that an Omnibus appropriations package for fiscal year 2017 has been finalized that leverages the high production lines at Ingalls, by providing full funding for the LPD 29 and long lead material for NSC 10 and we continue to urge both the Executive Branch and the Congress to support investment in 2018 and beyond, that efficiently leverages our hot production lines to build the future fleet that our nation requires. While the administration's 2018 skinny budget request has been released, it did not contain programmatic details. So, we look forward to reviewing the complete 2018 President's Budget request when it is released. So now I'll provide a few points of interest on our business segments. Ingalls achieved several milestones during the quarter, including authenticating the keel for DDG 121 Peterson and NSC 8 Midgett and christening the NSC 7 Kimball. In addition, LHA 7 AAA launched earlier this week. The team's focus is to continue executing well across all programs while repairing DDG 114 Johnson and LPD 27 Portland for sea trials and delivery, expected in the second half of this year. At Newport News, CVN-784 conducted successful Builder C trials in April and returned to Norfolk Naval Base to prepare for acceptance trials and delivery to the Navy. We are very pleased with the way the four performed during Builders trials and look forward to this first-of-a-class ship being commissioned into the Navy's fleet. SSN-787 Washington completed successful Builders trials in April as well and is also preparing for acceptance trials and delivery to the Navy. In addition, Newport News hosted Vice President Pen's last weekend for the christening ceremony of SSN-789 Indiana. CVN 72 Lincoln is preparing for sea trials next week and is expected to be redelivered to the Navy fleet later this month. This ship has been refueled and recapitalized and is prepared to serve the Navy for the next 25 years. So, turning to technical solutions, this was the first full quarter of operations for the combined segment. They won several small re-competes and new contract awards during the quarter and are executing work under contract while beginning the process of shaping and building the 2018 new business pipeline. In addition, the leadership team is focused on operating as a combined integrated business, in order to leverage their broad array of capabilities to pursue organic growth opportunities. In closing, I'm pleased with the execution and financial performance of our shipbuilding business and the progress that the technical solutions team is making with the integration process. We look forward to the administration's release of the FY'18 President's budget request, so that our team and the shipbuilding industrial base can begin determining the potential hiring, capital expenditures and supply chain implications. Now that concludes my remarks and I'll now turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials, Chris?
Chris Kastner: Thanks Mike and good morning. Starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter of $1.72 billion decreased 2.2% due to lower volumes at Ingalls and Newport News, partially offset by the acquisition of Camber. Operating income for the quarter of $164 million decreased $34 million or 17.2% from first quarter 2016 and operating margin of 9.5% declined 172 basis point. These decreases were due to lower volumes and risk retirements in our shipbuilding segments and a $29 million reserve we booked in our technical solution segment as a result of Westinghouse Electric Company filing for bankruptcy protection on March 29. Technical solutions, nuclear and environmental services business fabricates lower shield on air inlet intention ring, structural steel modules for Westinghouse AP 1000 reactor shield buildings. Due to the bankruptcy filing, we decided to reserve for all accounts receivable due from Westinghouse. Turning to Slide 5 of the presentation, cash from operations was $98 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $40 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $58 million or 3.4% of revenues compared to $37 million in first quarter of 2016. Additionally, we contributed $55 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the quarter of which $45 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified benefit plans. We also repurchased approximately 358,000 shares at a cost of $72 million and paid dividends of $0.60 per share or $28 million bringing our quarter end cash balance to $608 million. Moving on to segment results on Slide 6 of the presentation, Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $550 million decreased 6.1% from the same period last year driven by lower volumes on the DDG and LPD programs, partially offset by higher volume on the NSC program. Ingalls operating income of $66 million and margin of 12% in the quarter were down from first quarter 2016, due to lower risk retirement on the LPD program, partially offset by higher risk retirement on the NSC program. Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation, Newport News revenues of Ingalls 971 million in the quarter decreased 2.2% from the same period last year, primarily due to lower volume on the VCS program. Newport News operating income of $72 million and margin of 7.4% in the quarter were down year-over-year, primarily due to lower volume and risk retirement on the VCS program. Now to technical solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation, technical solutions revenues of $225 million in the quarter increased 8.2% from the same period last year, primarily due to the acquisition of Camber, which contributed approximately $80 million in revenues, partially offset by a favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract in the first quarter of 2016. Technical solutions' operating loss of $18 million in the quarter decreased $21 million from first quarter 2016 due to the $29 million reserves taken against accounts receivables due from Westinghouse and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes in the first quarter of 2016, partially assets by improved performance in the oil and gas services business and the acquisition of Camber. That concludes my remarks on the quarter. I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. And Ashley, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from David Strauss of UBS. Your line is open.
David Strauss: Good morning. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
David Strauss: First question. Could you just update us on schedule kind of risk retirement milestones as we go through the year? I think you've talked about before that they're weighted towards the second half of this year and what that means for the margin progression as we go throughout the year?
Mike Petters: We still think of the navy business as flat for the year at a 9% to 10% return on sales. Ingalls did have a good Q1 across a broad array as ships and continue to perform well and there are risk retirement milestones through the balance of the year and we're just going to have to see how we perform there, but we still believe it's 9% to 10% navy business.
David Strauss: Follow-up question, Chris, the free cash flow for the year, the conversion there, I think you talked about still targeting 100% despite the CapEx and pension headwind, is that still reasonable to think about it that way?
Mike Petters: Well it's reasonable to think about the $150 million of headwind that we face compared to 2016, teams working very hard top that with working capital performance, but we still see that $150 million of headwind in the year.
David Strauss: All right. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open.
Gautam Khanna: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Gautam Khanna: Just wanted to first follow up on David's question on the risk retirement schedule at Newport specifically, previously you mentioned on CVN 79 there's no real big risk items this year. I was wondering when you expect to start to approach some of those bigger milestones and what those are and then I have a follow-up on just -- go ahead.
Mike Petters: So, when you about Newport News, we've previously spoken about the transition between Block 3 and Block 4 of 78 and 79 and then the RCOH efforts. So, in 79, we don't launch that ship until 2020. So, we're going to be conservative as we move through the production cycle on that ship. There is really nothing material that I can I mention until the launch of that ship.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. So, there is no big opportunities favorable or negative next year either on the 79.
Mike Petters: Well we evaluate it every quarter, but I don't see anything significant.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. That's good to hear. I wonder just also ask about new programs. So, Icebreakers then talked about in the past kind of what the status is there, what your latest thinking is on LXR timing and Columbia Class funds starting to flow to you guys?
Mike Petters: Yeah all of that is essentially with this 2017 deal that's been reached in the last few days, where we've kind of come through a CR, which is pretty lengthy, which we're glad we're through that. We're happy with the way the '17 piece turned out. Now as we finish that part of it we're going to be -- it's all eyes on '18 what the budget -- what the request looks like and then how that gets worked through Congress. What I would tell you is that our discussions with the Pentagon and the Hill have been really focused on how is the most efficient way to buy the stuff you want to buy. Across the Board, I would say for the most part, the country knows what it wants to get. We're investing in those things to do that as efficiently as possible. The question is can you actually acquire them in the most efficient way. So, for example you didn't mention it, but the most efficient way to buy an aircraft carrier is to buy two of them at a time. We've done that before. That creates the rhythm in the business and the spacing in the business that is most efficient for the business and the same thing can be said for all of the other programs. The Virginia Class program, we're in a rhythm now where we're doing two per year. It appears that there's going to be demand for more than that and so how do we pace ourselves to increase that production flow. The Columbia class as we head to the first ship, what's critical now is that we have to keep the design money flowing through the budget process, so that we get that ship started on time and this is really tricky because lots of times we cut the design money in favor of other things and then we try to make it up in production, which leads to cost excursions in production. So, our view has not changed on any of this stuff. You need to keep moving. You need to be pretty sustainable on it. Buying Carriers two at a time, increasing the production of Virginia class, increasing the production of the DDG program especially Flight 3, accelerating the LXR program, so that you can get -- now that we have LPD 29 in the plan, let's now build right off of that and go into LXR. Let's make sure we do that as efficiently as we possibly can, but it's going to be all eyes looking at the 2018 budget and then not just the President's request but then how that debate plays out on the hill.
Gautam Khanna: Thanks Mike. I appreciate it.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Sam Pearlstein: I was wondering if could address something on Virginia class. Your partner on their first quarter call talked about a negative adjustment they had for a late delivery of the Block 3. So, can you talk a little bit about either what happened in terms of the recovery and then whether there was any financial impact to Newport News this quarter?
Mike Petters: There was no material financial impact. We dealt with that within the AC on the ship and there was just minor technical issues that had to be dealt with.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay. And if I could follow-up on the Westinghouse bankruptcy, if you've now reserved it in terms of receivables, is there still work to be done, is there any way that number can grow from here or is that everything that you'd be potentially exposed to?
Mike Petters: Well, that $29 million is for AR bankruptcy as of March 29. We're continuing to work and produce product for Westinghouse. We have a contract to do so and we fully expect to be paid for that. There is some assurance relative to the additional debt financing they received and then there are interim assessment agreements that they have in place with the owner. So, we have a contract. We're continuing to work and produce really good product. We expect to get paid.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay. Thank you.
Mike Petters: I think just to clarify that, I think the owners have stepped in with the intention of trying to figure out how do we proceed forward and continue to build these plants and so they’ve given us their assurance with these agreements that we need to keep working to support that while they go figure out how they're going to finish it. And so, we're operating under those agreements right now and under the bankruptcy court.
Sam Pearlstein: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
George Shapiro: Yes, I wanted to ask technical services Mike if I back out the $80 million Camber revenues and even if I add back $29 million, which I assume you lost in sales because of the reserve that was taken, you're still down like 16% and admittedly it's still a small part of the company, but what continues to be relatively weak there and what kind of hope is there?
Mike Petters: There is some seasonality there George, thanks for the question we fully expect that GS organization to be the $1 billion or roughly $1 billion for 2017 so right, there is some seasonality going on there.
George Shapiro: Well, but its year-over-year, so I won't think there's that much seasonality. I was just wondering what it transpire to be down that much on an organic basis year-over-year?
Mike Petters: Nothing significant that I can point to at this time George.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then could you just provide us the EAC in a quarter since I know it's going to be in your queue, which you're probably going to put out later anyway?
Mike Petters: You mean the cumulative adjustments?
George Shapiro: Yeah for each of the set -- for Ingalls and Newport News?
Mike Petters: So, there were $57 million positive, $31 million negative, about 65% of that positive was Ingalls, the rest Newport News and then they split to negative fairly equally.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Mike Petters: Sure George. You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Rob Spingarn: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Rob Spingarn: So, going back to some of the questions that were asked earlier, I think Mike you talked about all the various programs and how important the timing is etcetera, but when we think about the transition to LXR from LPD 29 and we think about the potential for Virginia class to increase to three per year, I think starting in 2022 and then a surge possible on the DDG 51. When you put all that together, how do we think about the range of annual CapEx under the various scenarios relative to what you're spending this year in '17 as we go forward the next few years?
Mike Petters: Yes, so that's a good question. We put in place a capital plan back couple years ago that really didn't -- that was really based on the 30-year plan at that point in time and since that time, the Navy has done there for structure assessment and all these other things have happened that have basically said that the fleet needs to be 20% bigger. And so, our capital plan that we have put in place before this $1.5 billion that we're working our way through, we're going to get to the end of that around 2020 or so. If we find ourselves in a place where we really do need to expand the business to be able to do three destroyers or three submarines, they want to look another look at it and see how that plays out in terms of when do we make -- do we need to make incremental adjustments or incremental investments and when should we do that to support the program? That's why I go back to, all eyes are on the 2018 budget, you've got to actually begin the path and begin the drumbeat of moving down those program lines so that not only we can make those investments, but our suppliers will make the investments that they need to make as well. I continue to insist that we can ramp up faster than the government can appropriate the funding. This is going to be a big signal to the whole industry about whether we should really go down the path or not and that's we'll be watching.
Rob Spingarn: From a magnitude perspective, where we talked about a $300 million type CapEx number today or just under that moving to $400 million with these newer ships…
Mike Petters: Yeah, but I think it depends on the program and the timing and there's a lot of variables that we'll have to read the tea leaves of how the budget has shaken out to sort that out.
Chris Kastner: I think you hit it on the head. I think that's right.
Rob Spingarn: I was going to say, is there a mitigating factor here that on several of the things we just talked about we're increasing volumes on existing program, so at least from a profit perspective, we can mitigate some of that increase. The timing would with lag. You'd spend the money on the CapEx and then taken the higher cash flow later, but it would seem to me that your margins would go up on three destroyers, three Virginia class etcetera.
Mike Petters: Yeah, I think the margin piece of it, what the volume does for us is it does give us a chance to be more efficient more because we can be more predictable in taking advantage of learning curves and capturing the value of whatever investments we make. But I think that just because that they announced that they're going to buy three submarines, that doesn’t change the margin profile in our business. We actually have to get into the work and walk through our risk retirement protocols that we always do to drive that -- to drive those returns. And frankly at the end of the day that whatever volume we have, I think it's just fair to say that shipbuilding is going to be in the 9% to 10% range. That's where our shipbuilding business is going to be. When you have low volume to pressure on it, when you have high-volume it has the opportunity to do -- to make it work better, but I think that's where we're going to be.
Rob Spingarn: So, on that note Mike, when do we see the margins tail off a little bit on the LPD program as we move away from 26 and into 27?
Mike Petters: I think the way to watch the LPD program is whether they can fill the pipeline. We've had 28 get added to the process. We've had 29 now get added to the process. We need to see LXR following on 29. I think that if we're able to do that, I think that we're able to -- we will be able to continue to retire risk and execute on that program and take advantage of the production line.
Rob Spingarn: I don't mean to lengthen the discussion, but given the fact that 26 was so ultra-profitable at the backend because it was booked so conservatively on the front end, aren’t we already starting to see some margin contraction because 27 was booked more evenly?
Mike Petters: There is going to be ships that do better than others and that's why we don't give specific guidance on margin by ship or report on margin specifically by ship. We still think it's a 9% to 10% return on sales business and LPDs make up a part of that.
Rob Spingarn: Okay. A strong part of that these days. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Before we take the next question, I would like to clarify a comment I made to George, in Q1 of 2016 we did have a restructuring of a fairly significant contract. So, when you think year-over-year from a sales standpoint, Q1 2016 what was a bit higher. So, we'll provide you with the details of that or we'll give you the detail of that subsequent to the call, but that does provide the rationale. Okay. Let's proceed.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.
Jason Gursky: Yes, good morning everyone.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Jason Gursky: I wanted to just continue on a little bit with Rob's question on the CapEx and the investments going into business and Mike I was wondering if you could may be update us on how effective the investments have been to date, or did you think what you had hoped that they were going to do and maybe just provide us some color on lessons learned and whether you are shifting a little bit on the plan and making some tweaks as you go along. Just trying to get a sense of how this is all rolling out, thanks
Mike Petters: Sure, that's a good question. First if I only start by saying that these investments are generational and long-term kinds of investments and their impact is going to be felt over a long period of time and not necessarily in the next year or the next quarter. That being said, some of the investments that we've made are already showing up value for particular programs. We made some very discrete investments for carrier construction on CVN 79 to drive learning curves in that program as we took the lessons that we learn from 78 and adjusted our build plan and our material plan for sequencing that ship and there are -- there are many, many examples. As I walk around that ship, I see many examples where we're building it differently to capture the lessons that we learn from 78 and that's being driven in some cases by the way that we invested the money and so those investments that we chose to make are playing out the way that we predicted they would. There are other long-term investments that are going to take a couple years just to build the facility and we're even going to be able to use or start to use the facility for 2019 or 2020. So that's a little bit harder to put our hands around. But I would back up one level on all of this. We began -- we made the decision to make this investment ahead of the Navy's reevaluation of the size of their fleet. We were making these investments to optimize our production in support of the third-year plan that was on the street at that point in time. We also have over the last six years -- we've done a got pretty decent job of getting our execution aside of our business in order getting that house in order. And so, I think that where we are today is that we're executing well and were investing against the future which gives the Navy some confidence that they can go out and actually talk about increasing production of existing programs. There may be a chicken and egg thing there about which came first, but I certainly believe that our partnership with the Navy and our ability to perform to the levels that we've been performing and our willingness to invest in their future gives them some confidence that that future that they're drawing out there is achievable. And I think that that's an important part for us to play in the future of our Navy.
Jason Gursky: Yeah, that's helpful and then just to think really quickly you made some comments about the oil and gas industry in your prepared remarks, maybe you're seeing some year-over-year improvement there. Can you provide a little bit of an insight on the pipeline there, whether the potential deals is indeed continuing to grow year-over-year and your expectation for the next 12 to 18 months, thanks?
Mike Petters: Sure, I'll take that, the cost structure, we've done a lot of work on the cost structure in oil and gas last year, to have that squared away and they're competing very well down in Houston and actually up in Canada as well, we're having staff in Canada, which is which is very positive. I think the stabilization of oil at the price it's currently at has helped provide some of the operators to make some investments. The pipeline while we haven’t seen a complete recovery, we're competing well for the stuff we're competing for and we're very hopeful that that organization will continue to improve as we move throughout the year.
Jason Gursky: Yeah, thank you very much. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Thanks Jason.
Operator: Our next question comes from Finbar Sheehy of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Finbar Sheehy: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Finbar Sheehy: If we go back to technical solutions and set aside the reserve that you took, it looks like the margins would've been nearly 5%. Previously you said the segment would have fairly low margins. Is this the level you had in mind?
Mike Petters: No, we expect TS to be at the low single-digit for this year. They had some small nonrecurring items that really not significant enough to mention in the quarter, which led to the 5%. So, we still believe it's low single digits, lower than 5%.
Finbar Sheehy: And how are you thinking about the portfolio you have there now from here? Are there additional capabilities you'd like to add for greater breath or ones where you would like to add for more volume?
Mike Petters: Well I think we're going to continue to evaluate data. Our major thrust right now is to complete the integration of the business and we're seeing -- we're seeing opportunities where the combination is starting to be able to pursue things that they couldn't pursue on their own before. Where that leads us to identification of capabilities that could be added, we'll have our eyes open for that and that's kind of the way we're thinking about it, focusing on the integration right now.
Finbar Sheehy: All right. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
Pete Skibitski: Good morning, guys.
Mike Petters: Good morning, Pete.
Pete Skibitski: Hey Mike, I want to talk about your LPD 29 looks like it's pretty much a done deal now $1.8 million ship and not sure how much is GSE, but I feel like you had some concerns in the past about Ingalls, work volume in revenue outlook maybe that 2018 to 2020 kind of timeframe. And it just seems like this ship even if it's built over four years or so, it seems like that would really meaningfully improved that outlook in that timeframe, am I wrong about that number one. And number two, does it also, are you really still looking at flattish revenue overall for the firm through 2020 or does this ship by itself kind of change that outlook?
Mike Petters: Thanks for the question. There is no question that we're better off with the ship than without it. I think that's clear. I think if we back up, the LPD program was going to end after LPD 27 and the LXR program was somewhere over the horizon and we made the point that as we were beginning to feel the production line heat up and become more efficient across the Board, we made the point that about the time we get this line really running, we're going to stop work and then sit on it for four or five years until the LXR program came. LPD 28 became the first step in a bridge to get from LPD 27 to LXR, but LPD 28 was not a sufficient bridge at the time. LPD 29 is the next piece of the bridge. The last piece of the bridge is to get LXR brought in a little bit and the more we can make LXR look like LPD, the more you're going to be able to take advantage of the production line that we have. So, all of that is part of the process and I would not say that -- I would say that LPD 29 is a very big step, but I wouldn't say that we're completely out of the woods on that yet. We still got to see the LXR program move ahead and we need and in all the new moving parts of the project we've got to see that LXR program stay the course and move ahead and take advantage of the production lines. That means it's got to look like LPD. Secondly, I would point out that the LPD program is only one of four programs that we have at Ingalls right now and so while it's a very important part of our business there, the National Security Cutter Program is important, Destroyer program is important and the LHA program is important. And so, once ship in one of those programs is not going to solve the problem, it becomes a part of the solution and we have to have -- we have to be looking at all of those. If we ramp up the DDG program, if the next LHA is on track, LHA 9 gets in the plan and we can move down the path where we continue to work the NSCs then I think you've got Ingalls will continue to be able to do this for a while. On the other hand, if you have hick-ups in all of that, all of those are important to the future of Ingalls and it’s not reliant on any particular one of them.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up, just this slow start to the year at Ingalls revenue line just being down year-over-year, would you say that that's indicative of how the full year might play out or is just the timing issue.
Mike Petters: No that's just timing, that's LPD 26 being replaced by LPD 28 and LPD 28 ramping, so just timing.
Pete Skibitski: Got it. Thanks very much guys.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is open.
Joseph DeNardi: Yes, thank you very much, Mike wondered if you could just update us on Slide 3 for DDG. I think there was some uncertainty as to how that program is going to be contracted, whether at fixed price or cost plus, how you're thinking about that now and whether that change is kind of the risk profile on that program.
Mike Petters: I think that's still moving around a little bit. We just saw some more funding for an additional destroyer in the writeup in the build for this week. How that gets phased-in feathered into the production line is something that the Navy is discussing with both companies at this point in time. And I would say that quite frankly all the options are still on the table. We believe that it's imperative that we move ahead with Flight 3 and we're trying to find that the best way to do that in support of our customer and so how we do that I think it remains to be seen, but that's kind of the -- and as far as I'm concerned, contract type goes along with the risk register. If you have a lot of risk, you got to think more about the cost type contract. If you think you've got your arms really around the risk, you can move more towards a priced, contract and because all of those options right now are on the table, are after wide open, I wouldn't put a stake in any one of those at this point.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay. So, you don't think that the risk as you see it now and mandate cost type contract?
Mike Petters: Certainly, when you change the ship to the extent this is being changed, that there will be -- there will be newness in those risk and the newness. The question really comes down to the maturity of the design and how confident we are that the design is mature enough to move ahead and that's part of the evaluation process we go through. We feel pretty good about that right now, but we still got some more work to do.
Joseph DeNardi: That's great and then just an update on Avondale and the proceeds there, where you discussion stand with the Navy at this point?
Mike Petters: Yes, we are continuing to discuss possible resolution with the Navy and we did actually do a formal filing at the end of April with the PCAs and we're following both paths. We think it's prudent to do that, but no real progress or information that we can provide at this time on that.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay. Thank you.
Mike Petters: You're welcome.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
George Shapiro: Mike, I just wanted to ask you, you were commenting how you kind of looking at the '18 budget to see what's really going to happen, but shipbuilding and they just approved '17 budget is up like 15% from Obama's initial request. So, won't that give you sufficient confidence or how much further of an increase do you need to see?
Mike Petters: Well I think you're exactly right George, I was scratching my head last night, trying to think when there was the last time we saw $20 billion SEM line right and I'm not sure I've ever seen that. So, there is no question that everyone is heads are in the right place saying this is something that we need to go do. So, I have confidence. Having said that, the proof is going to be in the pudding so to speak and when the budget request comes over on '18 there's things that we're going to need to see. What would I like to see? I would like to see a desired by two carriers get the contract -- get the carriers under contract two at a time. I'd like to see a stated intent to increase the volume in procurement for VCS and the DDG program. I'd like to see the LXR program stay the course or move ahead a little bit. I don't know if they can do all of those things, given the constraints that they have and so your point about shipbuilding being a long-term business is exactly right. One good year doesn't mean that we have a sustainable program. We've got to stay the course year for a few years to really get this moving and I'm optimistic about that, I'm encouraged that everybody is talking about it the right way. I'm watching the mechanics to make sure that mechanically it gets done.
George Shapiro: How much more you think the budget would have to go up to incorporate the items you just mentioned?
Mike Petters: I think it depends on how you decide you're going to fund it and pay for it. In the carrier case for instance if you decided that you wanted to buy two carriers at a time and you were going to fund all of that in one year, that would be a pretty significant piece, but the carriers are actually allowed to fund the ship over four years and if you decided to authorize and fund the ship -- two ships, you might decide that you're going to fund that over six years or something. So, there's -- like I said the mechanics matter and the pressure of where do we set the budget for any particular year and how are we going to manage the cash flow, I think is a very that a very detailed discussion between the Navy and the authorizers and the appropriators in the industry and my view is that's why I say one budget doesn't necessarily solve the problem. On the other hand, let me just say the '17 solution is a really good solution and I am really optimistic about where the '18 could go, but I need to see it mechanically get there.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Petters for any further remarks.
Mike Petters: Well, I just want to thank you all for joining us today. As we finish the first quarter we've got two carriers that are in the throes of delivery right now between the refueling and the Ford. We have a submarine that we're trying to deliver. And so, it's a busy time for us right now in getting ships available to the sailors in the fleet and we're excited about where our business is. We're exceptionally excited about the future of our business and we really appreciate the interest you have in our company and we look forward talking to you again. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-02-16 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today conference, Mr. Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Sandra. Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also, in their remarks today Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including certain segment and adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtonIngalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I’ll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today. Let me start by thanking all 37,000 members of the Huntington Ingalls team for another year of excellent financial results. Their focus, hard work and dedication enabled Huntington Ingalls to continue delivering on our commitments and creating long term sustainable value for our shareholders and our customers. So turning to page 3 of the presentation, sales of $1.9 billion for the quarter and $7.1 billion for the full year were slightly higher than 2015. Diluted EPS was particularly strong with $4.20 for the quarter and $12.14 for the full year. Operating cash was also strong, as we generated $345 million for the quarter and over $800 million for the year. Additionally we received $5.2 billion in new contract awards during the year, resulting in a backlog of $21 billion at the end of year of which $13 billion is funded. Shifting for a moment to developments in Washington DC; we are encouraged by the new administration’s desire to increase the size and readiness of the fleet. While this is welcome news, we recognize that achievement of this objective is a multi-step process that will span several budget cycles. We look forward to working with the administration, Congress, the Navy and the Coast Guard and our supplier base of 5,000 companies across all 50 states to continue to build the most affective and affordable ships that our nation may require. Now I’ll provide a few points of interest on our business segments. Ingalls conducted acceptance trials and delivered DDG 113 John Finn and NSC 6 Munro during the quarter. Both ships performed extremely well, and I am very pleased with the teams’ continued focus on safety, quality, cost and schedule that allows them to provide highly capable ships to our navy and our coast guard customers. Ingalls also launched DDG 117 Paul Ignatius and NSC 7 Kimball during the quarter and both ships are scheduled to deliver next year. We also received the detailed design and construction contract for LPD 28 and the construction contract for NSC 9, which leveraged the hot production lines and an excellent performance on these programs. In addition, the contract for LPD 28 is yet another positive step in building the bridge to the LXR program. And finally the LHA program continues to perform in accordance with our expectations. At Newport News, we continue working with our navy customer to support preparations for sea trials and delivery of CVN 78 Ford, while CVN 79 Kennedy continues to perform in accordance with our expectations by leveraging the lessons learned from Ford. The Virginia class submarine program continues its strong performance on block 3, as we transition to block 4. The refueling and complex overall team is preparing for a completion of CVN 72 Lincoln scheduled for the first half of this year, and continues to perform planning work for CVN 73 Washington’s refueling overhaul which will begin later this year. And CVN 65 Enterprise remains on track to complete its inactivation by the end of this year. Reflecting our commitment to optimize and expand our services business, we closed on the Camber Corporation acquisition and established a Technical Solutions segment during the fourth quarter. We expect TS to produce low-single digit top line growth as we offer a broader set of capabilities to a larger customer base. And we expect margins to improve from low single digits this year to the 5% to 7% range by 2020. So in closing, 2016 was an outstanding year for HIIs Ingalls and Newport News generated segment operating margin above 9% for the third year in a row. Operating and free cash flow were strong and we sustained a healthy backlog with $5 billion in new contracts. Looking ahead, we remain firmly committed to our path to 2020 strategy to invest $1.5 billion in capital to strengthen and protect our core shipbuilding business, to return substantially all of our free cash flow to shareholders via dividend increases of at least 10% annually and share repurchases and to leverage our deep technical services competencies and nuclear operations expertise to optimize and expand our services portfolio. That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris.
Chris Kastner: Thanks Mike and good morning. Today, I’ll focus my review on our consolidated results for the fourth quarter and the full year and then I’ll wrap up with some information on the outlook for 2017. For more details on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Before I get in to the results, let me review some portfolio changes we executed during the fourth quarter. We completed the acquisition of Camber Corporation and formed our new operating segment Technical Solutions, which replaced the other segment as our third reportable operating segment. So formation of Technical Solutions and the Camber acquisition are consistent with our strategic commitment to optimize and expand our services platform. Technical Solutions is comprised of Camber and several of our existing services subsidiaries including AMSEC, Continental Maritime of San Diego, Newport News Industrial, SN3, Undersea Solutions Group and UniversalPegasus International. Our financial results presentation today reflect a realignment of our segments which had no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, results of operation or cash flows. Also in 2015, our financial results included a few items that we adjusted for including an insurance litigation settlement, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt. Where applicable, all comparisons I make to 2015 are adjusted for these items. Please refer to the earnings presentation on our website or the earnings release from earlier this morning for more information on these adjustments. Turning to our consolidated results on slide 4 of the presentation and starting with the fourth quarter, revenues of $1.9 billion increased 29% from fourth quarter 2015. The increase was drive by higher volumes on the DDG and NSC programs at Ingalls and the acquisition of Camber, partially offset by lower volumes on the aircraft carrier and submarines programs at Newport News. Operating income of 268 million increased 81 million from fourth quarter of 2015, and operating margin of 13.9% increased 413 basis points. These increases were driven by higher risk retirement and improved performance on the DDG, LPD and NSC programs at Ingalls, improved performance on oil and gas services and fleet support at Technical Solutions, favorable changes in overhead costs and a local government incentive grant at Newport News and a favorable FAS/CAS adjustment. Moving on with the consolidated results for the full year on slide 5, revenues were 7.1 billion for the year, an increase of 0.5% from 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher volumes on the DDG and LPD programs at Ingalls, higher volume in nuclear and environmental products at Technical Solutions, partially offset by lower volumes on the aircraft carrier program at Newport News. Operating income of 858 million increased to 123 million from 2015, and operating margin of 12.1% increased to 169 basis points. These increases were primarily driven by higher risk retirement and improved performance on the LPD program and higher risk retirement on the DDG program at Ingalls, improved performance in oil and gas and nuclear and environmental at Technical Solutions and a favorable FAS/CAS adjustment. Interest expenses were 74 million for the year, a decrease of 19 million from the prior year due to the boundary financing and term loan repayment in 2015. Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 21.5% and 26.9% for 2016. This compares to 37.5% and 36.1% respectively for fourth quarter and full year 2015. These decreases were driven by the accounting change for stock based compensation and the release of uncertain tax positions. Turning to cash flow on slide 6 of the presentation, cash from operations was 345 million in the quarter and free cash flow was 205 million. For the full year, cash from operations was 822 million and free cash flow was 537 million, compared to cash from operations in 2015 of 861 million and free cash flow of 673 million. Cash contributions to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans were 205 million in the year, of which a 167 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans. The pension asset returns for the year were approximately 6.9% and pension discount rates decreased 26 basis points to 4.47% at the end of the year compared to 4.73% at the end of 2015. Capital expenditures in the quarter were 140 million and for the year capital expenditures were 285 million or 4% of sales. This compares to a 188 million of 2.7% of sales in 2015. Many of the capital projects are in full swing now, so you can expect our capital spend to be at this elevated level over the next few years. For 2017, we expect capital expenditures as a percent of sales to be between 4.5% and 5.5%. Additionally, we repurchased approximately 253,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of 40 million, bringing the total number of shares repurchased in 2016 to approximately 1.3 million at a cost of 192 million. We also paid dividend of $0.60 per share or 28 million in the quarter, bringing total dividends paid for the year to $2.10 per share or 98 million. We remain committed to returning substantially all free cash flow generated through 2020 to our shareholders. Before I get in to the 2017 outlook, let me bring you up to date on Avondale. In the second quarter, we requested from the contracting officer a final decision on Avondale’s restructuring costs. In December, the contracting officer denied claim. While we are continuing discussions with the contracting officer, we will also pursue our claim under the Contract Disputes Act. As we proceed, we remain confident that our claimed cost is allowable and allocable and the resolution will be in accordance with our cost recovery expectations. Now let me provide you with some below-the-line items for 2017 as shown on slide 7. We’re expecting a favorable net FAS/CAS adjustment of a 198 million for the year and we expect non-current state income tax expense to be in the 5 million to 10 million range. We expect interest expense of approximately 70 million for the year and the effective income tax rate to be in the 30% to 32% range. And finally, we plan to contribute 333 million to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans to 2017. Of which 290 million will be discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans. That concludes my remarks. I’ll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people in the queue as possible. Sandra I will turn the call over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Doug Harned: We’ve heard a lot about the navy objective force of 355 ships. Clearly that would add a lot to the budget. But let’s say that, that all happens and we go there, from Huntington Ingalls standpoint could you talk about what that means for you? It looks like the first real additions to the shipbuilding plan would occur and that 21 to 26 timeframe. How would you prepared for that and what do you think it would mean for your facilities today?
Mike Petters: I think you’ve already scratched that one of the things about the rhetoric and discussion and strategies and positions that everybody has out there is that none of this is a light switch that you just turn it on and you start building 350 ships this summer. Our view is that it’s going to take a few budget cycles even to start to align the programs up to do that. In order to get to those rates, they’re going to have to build, I believe they’ll need to continue to produce the ships that we’re already producing as oppose to go off on a whole new design program and design a new fleet. I think you’ll see mature programs get expanded. In the cases of particular programs that we’re involved with today, the capital investment that we’re making is in line with what we see in the current navy 30 year plan. If there were a significant expansion say in the submarine production or the carrier production or the destroyer production or the [Amphier] production, it would probably require more capital on our part to go and be able to meet that demand. I think though that I’ll stand by what I’ve said before. Our ability to meet that demand is - we’re a lot more faster than the government would be on this. We’ll be ready before they can get the money appropriated from the shipbuilder standpoint. From both Newport News and Ingalls perspective, we’ll be ready once we start to see the process begin to churn, we’ll have the workforce ready, we’ll have the facilities ready and we don’t see that as an issue for the buildup. We do though recognize that there are 5,000 suppliers that support our business, and making sure that they’ve been under a lot of strain over the 15 years. And if I thought there was a risk in the process, I think it’s probably in the supply chain. How do you get those folks to ramp up their production in order to support us? At the end of the day, if we don’t have the equipment from the suppliers to build on time, that ends up impacting the ship. So this would be a big buildup and it would require some pretty consistent messaging and some pretty consistent and persistent legislation over the next several years to actually achieve what you’re reading about right now. And so that’s kind of our view, although right now is that we’re very encouraged by the discussion. We think it’s better to have this discussion than not have it. There’s a lot of hard work to do. Number one, we’ve got to get through the FY’17 build, we’re in CR right now. Number two, we’ve got to figure out what the heck we’re going to do with sequestration and how that’s all going to work, and get that legislatively resolved. And then number three, the impact of ORP on shipbuilding in general. If you’re ramping up budgets maybe that problem that we’ve been talking about goes away. But until you do that, it’s still the number one issue out there. So that’s kind of our view of it.
Doug Harned: And the other aspect of it, I think you just alluded to it as, there’s a consistency budget issue here because if we went notionally to this plan in this budget cycle, these ships the new editions and most analysis I’ve seen of it suggest they will occur in 2021 and beyond actually the delivering ships, it will be beyond that point. And so what would it take to get comfortable that you can make the investments because clearly if you’re investing for something that may occur in a subsequent administration.
Mike Petters: But frankly Doug that’s what we always do. I mean the ships that we have under construction are for the administration after next anyway. And so, we always watch that sort of thing and there are certainly some things that we could see happening right now that would be near-term that would make - actually would have real impact to the success of buildup. For instance, lets buy two aircraft carriers at a time instead of one. We’ve done that before. That is the most efficient way; frankly you could do even more than that. But buying them in bulk is, it works for the smaller ship program, lets’ do that for the carrier. The next multi-year for destroyers maybe, let’s go to three per year instead of two per year. The next time we start to go to a multi-year on submarines, lets change the production rate in that. Well when we start talking about those changes that’s well in advance of the actual building in the yard. That process is the preparation process. We get some pretty clear signaling on that. We are more than comfortable to go make those investments. Another immediate things that could happen is accelerate the LXR program. Now all of those things, you’re right, all of those things don’t result in ships that would be delivered in the next four years or so, but all of those things would be clear signals that we’re actually going to go and do this buildup and that it would be worth our while to go make the investment and bring the supply chain along with us.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Wanted to get a better understanding on may be what your projections might be for your shipbuilding margins X services. Are they still 9% to 10% and I have a couple of follow-ups?
Mike Petters: Sure. And I think they are still 9% to 10%. We’ve said from the beginning that shipbuilding business should operate in the range of 9% to 10%. If you’re at the top end of that range, you’ll probably have really mature programs that are performing very well, and if you’re at the bottom end of that range you’re probably doing startup programs or doing early design work. I think 2016 actually proves the point; the three ships that we delivered in 2016 were ships in mature programs. And I think going forward; particularly Newport News is in transition time. They’re going to be starting up programs on the Kennedy, starting up the refueling overhaul of George Washington, moving in to the next block of submarines, and starting up the ORP program. So you’re going to continue to see the transition at Newport News in particular, play out in terms of where they are going to be relative to our normal band. On the other hand, at Ingalls our effort right now is, let’s take advantage of those hot mature lines. If we’re really going to build up the fleet, let’s go accelerate the programs and make sure we keep the lines hot so that we can continue to be efficient for the navy.
Chris Kastner: I can also add that in 2017, the way that our programmatic milestones lineup, they are more towards the backend of the year, so the opportunity to retire risk and the opportunity for margin is towards the backend of the year and not towards the front end.
Unidentified Analyst: So it’s actually a perfect to my next question. You mentioned one DDG and NSC 7 deliveries for ’17, and it sounds like that will be in the second half. Are there deliveries planned any Virginia-class attack submarines and LPD 27?
Mike Petters: At Newport News, 787 delivers the submarines second or third quarter or mid-year 2017. And then DDG 114 and LPD 27 delivered out of Ingalls. But again the major risk retirement milestones are towards the end of the year.
Unidentified Analyst: And then a follow-up on Doug’s question now and your commentary on the supply chain. Do you have any (inaudible) plans on how you might diversify and reduce the risk if there were a buildup?
Mike Petters: Well our approach - we’re very happy to have the kind of supply chain that we do. Like I said they’ve been under a lot of pressure. We evaluate that chain every day; we have lots of different ways to look at it in terms of where are the critical technology issue or the critical suppliers? What is their ability to support our demand? Does that affect the way we think about designing the ships? We do all of that sort of things. And I think beyond that, I don’t know that I want to say much more than there’d be case-by-case basis, where if we felt like there was a real need for us to step in and plot something up in some particular way, we might consider that. But in general, we want the suppliers to be healthy.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Mariana Perez Mora: It’s Mariana Perez Mora in for Ron. My question is related to the proposals increasing the Virginia class submarines to three per year and even four per year? Can you please provide color on how much upside to sales this could mean and how much CapEx you may have to invest in this a bit [further]?
Mike Petters: This is something that Doug was talking about. If anything like that happened it would be after 2020. Our view right now, we can run all kinds of different permutations on it, but without being terribly specific, we’re going to watch the appropriation process and figure out what the real buildup rate is going to be. I’m confident that whatever buildup rate they decide to go to over whatever timeframe they want to go to, we’ll be able to make that investment in a timely way. I don’t see that as something that we would particularly make an investment in this year or next quarter.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Chris when I look at the cash flow, it’s actually much weaker this quarter than last year’s quarter despite the much better earnings. But it looks like a lot of it was due to $118 million rise in receivables Q3 to Q4. So maybe you could just talk about what those receivables pertain to?
Chris Kastner: Nothing special going on there. We did deliver NSC 6 and did not get that receipt until subsequent or in 2017. So we delivered the ship and billed for it and haven’t received back in Q4.
George Shapiro: And then just where the margins and shipbuilding looks so much above what Mike said is even the high end of mature program. Was there a substantial EACs in the quarter and maybe you could just tell us how much?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, the non-recurring adjustments in the quarter were positive 89 and negative 32. Of the positive 89 million, it was roughly 70-30 Ingalls, Newport News and they split the negative adjustments. I would like to point out in Newport News there were two non-recurring items, the state grant for the apprentice school that we received in Q4 for $15 million and then $35 million through later through re-measuring our workers comp expense that Newport News booked in the quarter. So it’s not really a formal adjustment, but they are non-recurring items in the quarter that needs to be taken in to consideration.
George Shapiro: And once again the 35 million, because the 15 was spelled out in the release, but the 35 wasn’t, so just missed exactly what was that?
Chris Kastner: That was re-measuring our workers comp expense with the discount rate increase. Towards the end of the year, you re-measure it and we receive that benefit. The large workers comp liability that we maintained down in Newport News.
George Shapiro: And one last one for you Mike, you talked about this bathtub with Newport starting. So far you seem to be doing a spending job. What are risks that you see yet in ’17?
Mike Petters: I think as George as we’ve talked about before. We’re in the early stages of Kennedy in terms of - we’re buying equipment and we’re doing early fabrication there. And so we just don’t want to get out in front of our headlights in terms of taking credit for risk retired on a contract. In order to get that ship to contract, we took up pretty significant but we believe achievable challenge in terms of the pricing, and so we’re just to be very - as we’re in all of our programs, we’re very thoughtful and conservative about the way we go in to these programs on the front-end. We’re also doing exactly the same thing in the start-up on the next block of submarines. We’re doing well in block 3, but we’re moving in to block 4, and so we will be very conservative on the front end of that. The challenge at Newport News is that their deliveries this year are all cost type contracts, with the exception of the submarine. But the Ford delivery, the Lincoln delivery and the Enterprise delivery are all cost type of contracts. And so while those deliveries are critically important to the operation of the business and great people are doing great things to make that happen down there. From the adjustment and financial standpoint, they are less consequential than say a delivery of a mature program out of especially the programs that are coming out of Ingalls right now. So that’s the - what you’re seeing here is you’re getting a real insight in to the blend that we’ve been talking about for the last six years. And right now Newport News is kind of holding the bottom half of the blend and Ingalls is holding the top half of the blend. That’s not unusual and that’s not to be not unexpected, but it does create, it just going to continue to create some pressure, particularly on the Newport News side of it. And as Chris pointed out, even the retirements we have at Ingalls are going to be in the second half of the year. So, that’s kind of the way the business and you guys are seeing a whole lot of it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Sam Pearlstein: I was wondering if you could talk a little more about the new segment with technical solutions, and I guess two-fold, one is, looks like Newport News because some of the businesses came out of that, should we think in 2017 of Newport News is relative flat from this $4 billion number, now that you’ve pulled out some of the business and then the technical solutions just - what kind of size is this $185 million a reasonable run rate or is it not a reasonable run rate and I think you said single digit margins. Just what can you share on 2017 about the segments?
Chris Kastner: This is Chris, Sam. Yeah, I think you can assume Newport News that’s a normal run rate. Again we’re not going give on 2017, but that’s a fair assumption. And then as we said in our release, we believe the TS segment is essentially a billion dollar business going forward at low single digit, starting out at low-single digit return on sales moving towards 5% to7% in 2020.
Sam Pearlstein: And Chris on the pension contributions, we’ve talked a lot about the new mortality tables and that might step up a contribution. The 2017 number you put out there is mostly a voluntary contribution, are you getting ahead of that is there still a step-up in ’18 that we should be expecting or is this voluntary contribution really helpful with that?
Chris Kastner: We’re watching 2018 and then the implementation of the new mortality tables, it’s unclear whether they’ll be implemented or not. This current contribution is consistent with our policy to be 90% funded on a pre-pension release basis. So it could provide some benefit when the new mortality tables are implemented. So we’re going to stay consistent with our policy of funding it to 90% on a pre-pension release basis. We think it’s a right thing for the employees and we’ve been fairly consistent in that regard.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is now open.
Jason Gursky: Chris let me start with a question for you Chris and its’ one Avondale. Can you tell us dollar terms how much of the recovery you’ve already booked and has flown through P&L over the last couple of years?
Chris Kastner: Well we haven’t disclosed that amount. So, I’m not really comfortable providing that. We’re entering in to a formal stage with the Navy. While we’d like to get to a resolution on the matter at the end of the quarter, I believe we’re probably going to have to appeal to the contracting officer decision and proceed. But I’m really not comfortable. You know it’s a $273 million issue or $275 million of cost that have flown through our balance sheet. So we haven’t provided the actual P&L impact.
Jason Gursky: And can you just provide us a little bit clarity on what the process is from here? You suggested that there’s an appeal coming that was [arrested] or not familiar with these types of appeals. Can you just walk through the logistics of it and whether there are any milestones that we might be thinking about from timing perspective?
Chris Kastner: The first step will be to appeal at the end of the quarter and then it gets in the court system. I don’t’ have that information with me relative to the specific dates, but it could take a significant amount of time for resolution of the matter.
Jason Gursky: And then Mike for you, I’m just wondering some of the reviews that you’ve done with solutions business going forward and the expansion of it. Are you talking about organic at this point or are we still in a mode where we’re going to be out making some tuck-in acquisitions for that business and if that’s the case to return all of your cash flow to the shareholders, will you be looking to change the capital structure at all and should increase a little bit debt going forward?
Mike Petters: Our overall strategy has been pretty clear that if and when we choose to do something to broaden our business, we’ll be looking at the balance sheet as a way to do that, because our commitment is to return substantially all the free cash. When we laid that out, we created some disciplined financial criteria that we would have to go through before we would actually do something like that in terms of how fast it needs to accretive and those kinds of things. Having said that, we continue to think about where the businesses are and where we need to be for the future and where do we think that our ray of customers is going to need for us to be in the future. And so we’re actually going to continue to keep thinking and looking and keep the aperture open for possibilities in that area for we got some pretty good filters on that to make sure that we do it the right way. So that’s our approach.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.
Pete Skibitski: Mike just potential for another fiscal ’17 supplemental, it sounds like it would be kind of a readiness focus supplemental, but with some procurement as well. So I’m wondering if that happens in the spring, do you think there would be potentially a meaningful repair opportunity for you guys, because I think the navy is talking about a pretty huge backlog in repair. And then separately, at least out of the house there’s talk of maybe adding an LPD 29, maybe some other ships in that supplemental. Could you talk about the whole potential opportunity for us?
Mike Petters: Certainly the legislative process is something that we’re pretty keenly focused on in general. I think that in order to get to a supplemental you got to get through the ‘17 build of two. So all eyes are focused on getting through that; get out of the CR mode that we’re in, and get in to some of kind of regular order of sorts. So as we talked about before, the Newport News is kind of in the startup phase across broad range of their programs. Ingalls is in the mature phase of their programs. And what’s really important right now is that we continue to keep those production lines hot. So LPD 29 as a bridge to getting LXR funded and accelerated is a very important decision. The next NSC would also be crucial in that keeping the efficiency of that line that’s a very successful product line for both the coast guard and the company. And then getting the amphibs kind of locked down with the next LHA and the LXR program. I think those are all very important things too. What could happen in this supplemental though is really narrowly focused towards the NSC and the LPD. In terms of the fleet support side of the business, I mean we’re in that business today. We support the fleet all over the world. Our view is that as programs come along and as opportunities present themselves, we’re positioned to take advantage of that. If we see that areas where we are doing work are going to be expanded, we will be expanding. So that’s kind of our perspective on it. Kind of hard to say right now given a little bit of the fogginess in the crystal ball around the legislative activity in Washington.
Pete Skibitski: Got it and maybe just one quick follow-up for Chris. Chris can you give us the 2017 effective tax rate and then I’m guessing you guys could substantially benefit from a corporate tax rate cut. Do you see the same thing?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, 2017 is projection of 30% to 32%. Yes we obviously benefit from a tax rate change as everyone else would.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert Spingarn: Now I know you don’t want to talk too specifically about ’17, but based on everything that’s been discussed so far the book of business program of record excluding any plus-ups we might get which probably wouldn’t affect ’17 anyway. We think about the increase and the pension contribution is there any reason not to conclude that free cash flow would decline in ’17 or are there positive offsets that continue to (inaudible) free cash flow.
Chris Kastner: Good question Rob. We had a positive year in cash in 2016. There are a couple of items, you mentioned pension and also capital that are headwinds to meeting that number. We’re going to do all we can from a working capital standpoint to offset that because I have a personal goal to get to 1.0 cash conversion every year, and so we just have to offset those headwinds.
Robert Spingarn: Those numbers are pretty big, those headwinds. I mean on the (inaudible) 100 million to 150 million
Chris Kastner: Those are good numbers, yes.
Robert Spingarn: And then on the CapEx, can you move working capital enough there or there is some kind of equivalent upside in terms of just the fundamental revenues and operating profit?
Chris Kastner: We’re going to do our best. Cash is lumpy, as we continue to say we have large invoices and a small amount of programs that can fall over a year. That’s why we really don’t like to give cash guidance. But you identified a proper headwinds and probably the proper amount that we’re going to try to offset.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Carter Copeland: Mike, big picture question for you on just all of the commentary coming out of the new administration or even Senator McCain’s white paper around a significantly a larger navy than what we have today. If we end up going down that path and having a much bigger ship building budget and want to procure more vessels, how will the investment in the industrial base in terms of just CapEx share capacity expansion, how will that be funded? Will there be portions of that that are on you, that are built later or does the navy fund that? How would an expansion like that actually be put in to place?
Mike Petters: We actually look at that pretty much our investment. The challenge that you have when you have multiple programs in a facility is that most of the types of facilities that we build are multiple program kinds of facilities. And the way the budget process works and if the government decided it wanted to build the facility to support the building of a particular program, the funding for that would come out of that particular program. When the facility is going to be used for multiple program, it gets to be really hard for the government to do that kind of thing. And so from our standpoint, we look at all of this from the standpoint of those are investments that we will need to go make. But we also do them from the standpoint that its - they are multiple programs and they’re going to improve the efficiency and probably that the program will actually happen.
Chris Kastner: I might add that the State of Mississippi and the State of Virginia are excellent partners with us in assisting us in capital investments. They’ve helped us previously and that’s a potential as well in the future.
Carter Copeland: That’s great, and that’s what I figured. I just wondered, are you looking at where the yards are today to come anywhere near what’s sort of being thrown around that there’d be a pretty significant amount of capital investment I would assume?
Mike Petters: I think it depends on how does it shake out. We are investing today for the 30 year plan, but our best guess is to have a 30 year plan is going to shake out. If there’s significant ramp up in that, we would probably have to go and make some additional investments incremental to what we’re doing now to be able to handle the throughput. But as we’ve talked about today, that throughput doesn’t show up until the middle of the next decade. So I think you just to take it program by program. And Chris is right, we do have great partnerships with the states and we have a great partnership with the navy. But in the end most of the investments that would have to be made would be ours.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: It’s actually Matt on for David. Following up on the cash question from earlier, I guess do you expect the return on a 100% of cash in ’17, I know you’ve got kind of a longer term goal to do that but ’16 was quite a bit below?
Chris Kastner: Really just a rule of thumb that I have that I think you should always try to get to 1.0 cash conversion. I think the previous conversation was correct. There are two items of headwinds that amount to between $130 million to $150 million compared to 2016 that we’re going to try to offset.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. But like in terms of how much you’ll return to the shareholders I guess longer term?
Chris Kastner: Yeah, we don’t have a specific number in 2017. But we remain firm in our commitment that we’re going to return substantially all by 2020.
Unidentified Analyst: And maybe I missed it, but did you say its Lincoln delivered that was going to be before the end of 2016 and then what do you think (inaudible) deliver?
Mike Petters: We see both of those programs in the first half of the year, given where they are now, and both of those teams are working pretty hard to get those ships ready to go to sea.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Just a follow-up on that cash question, so you returned about 54% of free cash flow in ’16. Now was that due to the Camber acquisition which limited it and so you go back to a higher kind of return?
Mike Petters: No, not really. That’s why we put a commitment through 2020 George. We know there’s going to be times where we’re behind or ahead based on how the cash flow is distributed throughout those years. So it had nothing to do with Camber acquisition. It’s just how the plan was executed.
Operator: And I’m showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mike Petters for any further remarks.
Mike Petters: Well thanks to everyone for joining us today on the call. 2016 was an outstanding year for HII, and certainly sets a high standard for years ahead. With that being said, I’m confident that our leadership team is up to the challenge as we see coming our way. Thanks for your interest in our company, and we look forward to seeing you soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-11-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2016 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Sonia. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, Executive Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also, in their remarks today Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including certain segment and adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our Web site. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our Web site at huntingtonIngalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I’ll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today’s call. We released third quarter 2016 financial results this morning that reflect solid overall operating performance driven by program execution at Ingalls. So let me share some highlights starting on Page 3 of the presentation. Sales of $1.7 billion were down 6.5% from last year and diluted EPS was $2.27 for the quarter compared to $2.29 last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $194 million and $332 million year-to-date. We received $1.2 billion in new contract awards resulting in backlog of approximately $20 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $12 billion is funded. Now let me share a few operational highlights. At Ingalls, DDG-113 John Finn successfully completed Alpha builder’s trials, the first Arleigh Burke class C trials in nearly six years. In addition, strong NSC program performance continues as NSC-6 Munro successfully completed acceptance trials. Both ships are expected to deliver by the end of the year. Importantly, Ingalls was awarded two contracts for design work on the amphibious warfare ship replacement, the LX(NYSE:R), a new class of ships we are well prepared to build with a hot production line and mature learning curve given the hull form for this new class of ships is the same as the LPD class. Ingalls also won a competitively big contract to overhaul the destroyer DDG-61 USS Ramage. At Newport News, CVN-78 Ford is essentially complete, with less than 10% of the overall test program remaining to be completed. We are prosecuting the repairs on the main turbine generators and moving towards sea trials and delivery as efficiently as possible. This program, albeit challenging, has demonstrated great teamwork by our shipbuilders, our customer, and the forge crew, and I’m very proud of that collaboration, and I’m very proud of that ship. Newport News also was awarded a $195 million contract modification for continued advance planning for the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN-73 George Washington. On submarines, the Virginia-class team continues to prepare for an early to contract delivery of SSN-787 Washington, the second Block III submarine delivered by Newport News, and the 14th submarine of the Virginia-class. And we look forward to the Navy’s milestone B decision on the Ohio replacement program set for later this month. Now I want to shift for a moment and address two recent announcements related to our path to 2020 strategy. First, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share. This reaffirms our commitment for dividend increases of at least 10% annually. And second, we announced the acquisition of Camber Corporation and the establishment of our technical solution segment, an organizational change that consolidates our services subsidiaries under a single reportable segment. One of the key tenants of our strategy is to optimize and expand our services portfolio. The acquisition of Camber and the establishment of our technical solution segment enables us to do just that. We are very excited about the Camber acquisition and are pleased to welcome their 1,700 employees to the HII family. Camber, based in Huntsville, Alabama, and with their significant presence in the Washington DC area, provides sophisticated mission-based professional services and high-end IT solutions to a wide range of U.S. government customers. These customers include the Navy, Army, Marine Corps, the U.S. court system, the Postal Service, and the intelligence community. We are already teaming with Camber in support of the U.S. Navy, so we are familiar with their personnel and culture and believe it will be a great fit with us together. Their highly qualified and professional workforce, broad array of high-end capabilities and long-term customer relationships provide numerous opportunities to strengthen our position in government services and capitalize on our existing AMSEC franchise. In addition, their prime position on several large contract vehicles coupled with AMSEC’s provide the combined companies the ability to compete for work previously only accessible as a subcontractor. Camber will be a foundational component of our new technical solutions segment, a roughly $1 billion segment that will also include our AMSEC, Continental Maritime, SN3, Newport News Industrial, Undersea Solutions Group, and UniversalPegasus businesses. We believe that the establishment of this new division will not only create a strategic focus on these businesses, but will also improve performance transparency. We anticipate top line growth for this business in the low single digit range in line with the outlook for government services budget and operating margin expanding from low single digits in 2017 to the 5% to 7% range by 2020. So in closing, this quarter’s results at Newport News demonstrated the volume and margin pressure that we talked about on the call last quarter. However, given the strong performance at Ingalls, we still expect total company sales to be essentially flat and margins to be in the 9% to 10% range for the full year. We remain focused on program execution, risk retirement, and cash generation in order to create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. We also look forward to the closing of the Camber acquisition by the end of year and integrating Camber and the other subsidiaries into the technical solutions segment. That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Christopher Kastner: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Today, I will review our third quarter consolidated and segment results, as well as provide you with a few updates for the full year. But first, I’d like to walk you through the transaction summary for our acquisition of the Camber Corporation, starting with Slide 4 of the presentation. As Mike mentioned, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Camber for 380 million. The purchase price includes approximately 25 million of tax benefits. The purchase price net of the tax benefit represents a multiple of 8.6 times Camber’s adjusted EBITDA for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. We plan to fund the transaction with cash from the balance sheet, which at the end of the third quarter was 957 million, and we anticipate that the deal will close by year end. Camber generates low double digits to EBITDA margin with low capital investment and we expect the transaction to be accretive to cash flow and earnings per share in 2017. Moving on to our consolidated results on Slide 5 of the presentation, total revenues for the quarter were 1.68 billion, a decrease of 117 million, or 6.5% from third quarter 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes at Newport News, and to a lesser extent lower volumes at Ingalls. Total operating income for the quarter was 175 million, a decrease of 25 million, or 12.5% from the third quarter last year. Total operating margin was 10.4%, a decrease of 71 basis points from the same period last year. These decreases were driven by lower volumes and risk retirements at both Ingalls and Newport News, and partially offset by the favorable FAS/CAS adjustment. Turning to Slide 6 of the presentation, cash from operations was 254 million and free cash flow was 194 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were 60 million, or 3.6% of revenues compared to 37 million or 2% of revenues in the third quarter last year. Year-to-date, capital expenditures are 145 million, or 2.8% of revenues, and for the full year we now expect capital spend to be between 4% and 4.5% of revenues. Additionally, we repurchased approximately 407,000 shares at a cost of 68 million and paid dividends of $0.50 per share or 22 million. Moving on to segment results on Slide 7 of the presentation, Ingalls revenues for the quarter were 577 million, a decrease of 16 million, or 2.7% from the third quarter last year. The decrease was driven by lower volumes on the LPD and NSC programs, which were partially offset by higher volume on the DDG program. Operating margin of 11.4% for the quarter decreased 155 basis points from the same period last year due to lower risk retirement on the LHA program. Turning now to Newport News on Slide 8 of the presentation, revenues for the quarter were 1.1 billion, a decrease of 105 million, or 8.9% from the third quarter last year due to lower volumes on aircraft carriers and the VCS program. Operating margin was 7.4% for the quarter, a decrease of 113 basis points from the same period last year due to lower risk retirement on the VCS program, as well as a Q3 2015 resolution of outstanding contract changes on the CVN-71 RCOH. With respect to the other segment on Slide 9 of the presentation, revenues for the quarter were 33 million, an increase of 3 million or 10% from third quarter last year due to higher volumes in the oil and gas services market. Operating loss for the quarter was 5 million, consistent with the operating loss in third quarter 2015. Now for some updates on the full year on Slide 10 of the presentation. We’re now estimating a FAS/CAS adjustment of approximately 145 million for 2016, which is slightly higher than our previous estimate as a result of updated census data. Additionally, we now expect deferred state income tax expense of approximately 10 million for the year, which is at the lower end of our previous range. For the full year, we still expect interest expense of approximately 75 million, and our effective tax rate to be between 30% and 32%. Now for a status update on Avondale. During the third quarter, we received a response from the customer regarding our request for a final decision on the restructuring costs for Avondale. The customer informed us that a final decision would be issued before the end of the year. Therefore, I should be able to provide you with another update on our year-end call. I also want to share with you our initial thoughts on pension for 2017. The discount rate we use to value our pension liability has gone down approximately 80 basis points from the rate at the beginning of year, which was 4.73%. Given today’s low interest rate environment and the final phasing and harmonization in 2017, we expect both FAS expense and CAS cost to be higher next year. As a result, the FAS/CAS adjustment for 2017 is expected to be more favorable than 2016. From a cash perspective, while pension contributions are expected to increase as a result of lower interest rates, our net pension cash position after CAS recoveries should remain positive in 2017. Remember, pension is a very complex subject that is impacted by numerous factors, so it’s important to not get too specific until we have more clarity around the variables. As such, I will provide you with more details on the 2017 FAS/CAS adjustment and our 2017 cash contributions during our year-end call. That concludes my remarks. I’ll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Sonia, I’ll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.
Jason Gursky: Good morning, everyone.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning.
Jason Gursky: Mike, I’m wondering – I guess everyone there if you could maybe dive a little bit deeper into the most recent acquisition, talk a little bit about any kinds of revenue synergies that you might see over time. And then talk a little bit about the past forward on the margins and what’s going to allow for the margin expansion in this new division over the next couple of years, as you’ve laid out in your prepared remarks?
Michael Petters: Sure. First of all, we’re very excited that we’ve been able to execute this transaction. Camber is a government services provider. They provide pretty high-end mission-based services and high-end IT solutions. They have a large Navy presence. We actually team with them on some opportunities with the Navy through our AMSEC subsidiary. But they also have access to other customers, the armies, the intel community, some other parts of the government that frankly some of the capabilities that AMSEC has could be deployed toward those customers and in return some of the customers that AMSEC has, like NAV-C could have access now. We can have more access for Camber to reach into that. I think in a broader sense, these two businesses together have an opportunity to pursue new customers that neither one of them could pursue on their own. And so we’re excited about that. We think that they are just a great strategic fit and frankly the initiative for this acquisition came from inside the business unit. It’s the folks on the deck plate that came and kind of suggested this and we took off – we’ve been looking at this for quite a while and we got it to work out, consistent with the discipline that we laid out in front of you a year ago. Beyond that, we’ve learned a lot from the acquisitions that we’ve done. One of the key things that we have learned is that the pace of the services business is very different than the pace of our normal shipbuilding business. I think we kind of knew that from our government services already, but I think that now that we have the scale with Camber and AMSEC, SN3, and NNI, we put all of those together, we now have the scale to focus on that business in a way that will allow for the pace of the business to be consistent with what is required to be successful in the services business. And it gives us an opportunity to create some growth for the corporation. Our shipbuilding business has been – from the beginning of the spin, we’ve been talking about the shipbuilding business as basically a flat business. We continue to kind of talk about that today, although there may be some opportunities ahead of us. But now we actually have access to a little bit more of the normal natural growth progression in the government services field. And so all of that is very exciting to us. The creation of a third business unit will create a lot of transparency. Transparency is a double-edged sword, for sure. You’ll get to see a lot of what’s happening, good and bad. And we’ve got some work to do to get that entire business segment to a place where the margins are in the normal range and we think the normal range is in the 5% to 7% area. When you first see this come out, there’s going to be all of the puts and takes of a whole lot of different kinds of businesses there. UPI is going to be in there, Continental will be in there, and so we’ll be, as Chris pointed out, low single digit margins with an opportunity to expand those over the next three to five years. And so we think it’s a reasonable approach for us to take to expand the capability of the business, to expand again our customer set, and create access for unique capabilities on the high-end side of the services business to a new set of customers that makes great sense for us and we hope will make great sense for our customers.
Jason Gursky: That’s great. Chris, can you just comment really quickly on the margin expansion and the source of that margin expansion as a new business?
Christopher Kastner: Sure. Initially the low margins, as Mike indicated, are a result of UPI being in the mix and being challenged coming out of the gate and then some investments we’re making in the DOE space for SN3. So, naturally as UPI recovers and we’re successful in our initiatives relative to SN3, you should get a margin lift there. Camber and AMSEC performed very well already. We just need to ensure that we continue that performance.
Jason Gursky: Got it. That makes sense. Thanks, guys.
Michael Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Gautam Khanna: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning.
Gautam Khanna: Chris, I was wondering if you could just get into a little bit more color directionally on the pension. You mentioned FAS/CAS is actually going to be up next year. Could you give us any sense for what the increase in cash contributions will be for the plan next year, discretionary to keep the 90%?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, it’s a little early for that, and I know you’re frustrated with that answer. I’ll be able to give you that at the year-end call. But I wanted to give you some indication that net cash would be positive and at a similar level plus or minus $20 million from where we are this year from a net cash standpoint.
Gautam Khanna: Okay, that’s not terrible by any means. And you mentioned you did this deal obviously with Camber. Is there any change to the cash deployment strategy in terms of deploying 100% of free cash for dividends and buybacks, or how should we think about the M&A strategy as you --?
Christopher Kastner: It’s a good question. It actually enhances it because there’s going to be more free cash to be distributed to shareholders. So we’re using cash on the balance sheet to do this. We’re still committed to investing in our shipyards; $1.5 billion over the next five years, and we told you about our dividend of the 20% increase earlier this week. And we’re still committed to at least a 10% increase over the next four years, and we’ll evaluate that as we come to our plans for those years. But really no change to the strategy; it just provides more cash flow for shareholders.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And the last one, maybe Mike, can you update us on what the milestones we should be tracking for the Ohio class are?
Michael Petters: Yes, there’s a major milestone coming up this month we think that will kind of cut loose a lot of the contracting. I think the real question on Ohio class continues to be how the funding is going to work out. The business arrangement has been worked out. Our partners at General Dynamics and the Navy, we’ve got that all sorted out. We kind of know exactly the path ahead, now it’s just a question of can we get through the – can we get the funding straight and can we get out of the sequestered environment that’s kind of keeping a potential for a wet blanket on all of our plans. So that to me is the real big thing to pay attention to. The mechanisms inside the Pentagon are kind of on track.
Gautam Khanna: Thanks a lot, guys.
Michael Petters: You bet, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning.
Sam Pearlstein: Chris, can you talk about the – you said you’re funding this acquisition with cash on hand. How should we think about how much cash you need to hold on the balance sheet to run the business? Because it looks like you’ve been $900 million to $1 billion in cash for four or five years now, so are you now going to be able to run at a lower level?
Christopher Kastner: Yes. I’m comfortable between $500 million and $600 million on the balance sheet and even beneath that. We have a revolver in place that I really wouldn’t want to tap in for operational issues, but our balance sheet is very healthy and I’m comfortable at the $500 million to $600 million level for sure.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay. And then the capital spending increase this year in terms of just the percentage of sales, is this timing? Have you pulled things forward from '17, so that maybe '17 is then a little bit lower? How should I think about it between the two years?
Christopher Kastner: We’ve expected this strong capital spend in 2016 for a while. Remember it was 3.5% to 4.5% as we started the year and we’re drifting between 4% and 4.5% now. We think that '17 is going to be a strong year for capital. All these initiatives are started. I drove by the north yard last week and a lot of activity, preparing for the ORP program, a lot of work going on down there. So these major projects have been initiated, and I expect significant capital not only this year but next year.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay. And then one last question is just on the Board. Is there any way to think about – are there any financial implications of the delay in the acceptance there?
Christopher Kastner: We have re-phased our issues [ph] to reflect the work to go on the contract and there is a minor adjustment, not significant enough to mention within the quarter, that we’ve already taken into consideration.
Sam Pearlstein: Thank you.
Christopher Kastner: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Yes. Chris, following up on Sam’s questions, so the implication though as to even to get to 4% of sales for CapEx is the fourth quarter has got to be like 130 million, which is almost as big as the first nine months put together. So I know the fourth quarter is always strong, but it’s not usually that strong. So maybe you can just talk a little bit about why it’s going to spike up so much?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, there’s some major investment going on at Newport News. As I said with the ORP program and some significant invoices related to those buildings as well as the fixtures there. So always a couple invoices could slip into next year, but I look at this significant basis on a monthly basis and I fully expect to be between 4% and 4.5% for the quarter.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then one for you, Mike. How do you trade off making this acquisition, which is modestly accretive, but it would be bigger accretion if you just used the cash to buy back stocks. How do you trade that off in your own mind?
Michael Petters: Well, I think the first place I’d start with, George, is where’s your horizon? This is a long-term business and we have a customer, our Navy customer, has a 30-year plan that we’re trying to figure out how best to support it. And so we might be able to feel good about something we could do in what we would call the short-term, which is like three to five years. But the real question is how do you build the right set of capabilities for this company to partner and support all of our principal customers for the long term? So we have a plan today that’s going to increase our dividends by 10% a year. We have a plan today that returns with the dividends and the stock buybacks. We’re going to return all of our free cash flow to our shareholders over the next five years and we’re going to do this transition without affecting that. And as Chris pointed out, this transaction actually increases the cash flow. There’s a trade-off there, but I’m not sure it’s really that hard to figure out which way we need to go, because we still have to keep our eye on a horizon that’s pretty far away.
George Shapiro: And then just to follow up on that, the future acquisitions I would assume will be more in this service area as opposed to the oil and gas?
Michael Petters: Yes, sure. This is consistent with what we said a year ago that we’re going to execute in our core business, we’re going to grow our services, and we’re going to return all of our free cash to our shareholders. The oil and gas basis, I think that 10 years from now we’re going to be glad we were in that space, but it’s been pretty rocky for the past few years. And right now if you try to – even if you try to do something over in that space, I think valuation becomes a crapshoot. So we’re not terribly interested in rolling the dice like that. But we’re very proud to be in that business and we’re proud of the work that we do in that space, and we keep a close eye on it.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Michael Petters: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Finbar Sheehy: Good morning. It’s Finbar here for Doug.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning.
Finbar Sheehy: I’m wondering if you could – just on the Newport News side, you said that there’s a lower volume on VCS Block III, which sort of came I guess sooner than the ramp up of volume on Block IV. Is that an accident of timing in the quarter, or is there more of a clear revenue dip in recovery pattern we should be thinking about as you transition between blocks?
Christopher Kastner: Yes, you used the right word. It’s transitional. So Block III to Block IV, CVN-72 to CVN-73 for the RCOH efforts and then CVN-78 to CVN-79. So it’s kind of a gradual transition. We still expect it to be essentially flat over the next couple of years. That being said, we’re rolling up our plans right now and we’ll have some more visibility in that at our year-end call.
Finbar Sheehy: Okay. And to follow up on the services business and creating the new segment, you commented that the new segment would initially have fairly low margins and part of that is coming from margins that are currently showing up in the other segment. But does it also have implications that you would be moving low-margin work out of the shipbuilding segments and possibly reporting them at a nominally higher level going forward?
Christopher Kastner: Absolutely. You’re going to get a lot more visibility into the shipbuilding margins directly related to shipbuilding. So part of the transparency is not only on our services segment, but the transparency that you get related to shipbuilding. So we’re still committed to 9% to 10% return on sales in shipbuilding and I think that’s the right margin for that business.
Finbar Sheehy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Peter Skibitski of Drexel. Your line is now open.
Peter Skibitski: Good morning, guys.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning.
Peter Skibitski: I got on a bit late, so I’m sorry if you addressed this. But the 8.3 million nonrecurring expense and then the 12.6 million intangible amortization, are both of those one timers in the fourth quarter and then go to zero in '17, or is the 12.6 million kind of flattish for a number of years? I’m just wondering how that works.
Christopher Kastner: Yes, the 8 million is definitely a one-timer. The 12 million extends out for a while.
Peter Skibitski: Okay, got it. And then on the Ingalls margins, as I look back to even back to 2014 on an adjusted basis, Ingalls has been in the – really in the solid double-digit margin rates, so I’m wondering when we should start thinking of this segment in particular as kind of a 10% to 12% margin unit going forward or has this been some type of secular issue that’s going to abate soon, or how should we think about that?
Michael Petters: Yes, I think you should think about it as the latter. Only from the standpoint of if you look at where that business is, they’re executing mature programs today and they’re executing them very, very well. But on the horizon is a new LXR program, there’s going to be a new competition for the DDG program. We’re just getting started really right on the front end of LHA-8, which we just won this summer. There’s a whole big discussion about an icebreaker program. So these new programs that are out there in the next – in the five-year timeframe are kind of the cycle of the business. And a big part of what Ingalls has to do is go capture a lot of that work. Clearly their performance that they have is going to help them capture that work, but they’ve got to go capture it. And then just like Newport News is going through a transition, they’ll go through a transition as well. They are benefiting right now from working – doing really good work on what had been some pretty tough programs, and they’re being rewarded for it.
Peter Skibitski: Okay, very helpful. My last one on Newport News on the margins this quarter, is that pretty much all related to the forward delay, or is it the lower volumes? And should we expect kind of year-to-date around 8 percentage or so? Is that the right level to be at until you’re out of this transition period, which I can’t remember if that’s kind of second half of '17, or when we break out of that? Can you speak to that?
Christopher Kastner: There was some broad-based pressure related to increased CAS cost at Newport News as well. So I would expect total shipbuilding to be between 9% and 10%. I really would rather not talk about individual yards return on sales performance.
Peter Skibitski: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Joseph DeNardi: Thank you. This just goes back to a prior question, but Mike you’ve talked about kind of a healthy margin being 9% to 10% when you strip out the services business, and what does that become going forward?
Michael Petters: No, that’s actually it’s going – we think that the healthy yard is 9% to 10%. We’ve been operating with services buried inside of Newport News for almost six years, which has been a pressure on Newport News in terms of the 9% to 10%. So stripping this out, what you’ll see is our two shipbuilding segments. I would love to be able to tell you that each of those segments would operate in the 9% to 10% range in a healthy way, but what you’re actually seeing now is what we’ve been talking about. Newport News is going – we’ve been talking about the transition at Newport News for quite a while now. These carrier deliveries that are coming up and then the transitions that Chris mentioned, 78 transitioning to 79, 72 refueling transitioning to 73, the VCS Block III transitioning to Block IV, the startup of the ORP program. Those transitions are happening at Newport News, which that puts them on the lower end of that range. On the other end, Ingalls is at the top end of the range, simply because they are executing very mature programs and they’re doing it exceptionally well. And so between them today you see – you kind of see between the two units how what I think if we lived in the best of all possible worlds you would see that could happen inside of any particular shipyard. We’re just a little bit out of phase at Newport News right now, but we’ll work our way through that over the next 12 to 18 months. And at Ingalls, the question is business development. Can you go capture the new work that’s out there and get it on time? And all of that is why we keep saying that you have to figure out how to get ORP funded, because if you try to take the ORP funding out of the Navy shipbuilding account, it’s going to squeeze programs down and delay them, which will have effect in our shipbuilding business. We think that’s an industry-wide problem, it’s not just an HII problem. But I think it’s the number one issue facing the Navy shipbuilding account, and it’s a subset of the major issue of what the heck are we going to do about sequestration, because we’ve got to get that fixed.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay, that’s helpful. And then can you just give us an update on CVN-79 just maybe in terms of kind of percent complete at this point and just how the construction’s going?
Michael Petters: It’s going really well. We set some pretty good budgets for our labor cost down there and we’re essentially meeting all of those.
Christopher Kastner: It’s a bit over 20% complete --
Michael Petters: A bit over 20% complete. That includes material procurement, but we’re doing pretty well. We’re hitting our targets there.
Joseph DeNardi: Great. And then just lastly, just on Camber and kind of the services business going forward, mid-single digit margins is okay. It’s not particularly exciting. So are there any other financial metrics? You talked about the business opportunities, but other financial metrics that you look at that gets you guys excited whether it be a return on capital, that type of thing?
Michael Petters: Well, I think we started last year. We told you that our shipbuilding businesses are return on sales kinds of business and our services businesses really need to be a return on capital business, and that’s what excites us about this headline of 5% or 6% or 7% may not get you moving, but a return on the capital investment is minimal. So it’s really about people, it’s about the intellectual property that they bring, and the relationships they have with their customers, and the ability to create cash at the bottom line for our shareholders, and that’s what’s exciting to us. I’m excited that we actually were able to put together this transaction in a way that met the pretty disciplined guidelines that we laid out for you a year ago. We’re going to be creating more cash flow for our shareholders because of this transaction, and we’re excited about that.
Joseph DeNardi: Great. Thanks, Mike.
Christopher Kastner: I will say the capital requirements are less than 1% for that organization on a run rate going forward, so that when you think about the difference in how we look at the capital – the investment returns, the capital requirements over there are very minimal.
Joseph DeNardi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Christopher Kastner: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Mike, I wanted to ask a high level question as we talk about margins and with them performing so well at Ingalls lately in the double digits. When you have serial production in a program, and you referred to mature programs, should ship margins progress from ship-to-ship, or is there a point at which you’re sharing with your customer? You’ve been very clear about the business being a 9% to 10% margin. Might we get to a situation where the margins contracted on the back end of a serial production run?
Michael Petters: You could see that, Rob, if you define the serial production lines being across several contracts. Like the submarine program has had multi-ship contracts – Block III was several ships, now Block IV is several ships. When you go and you do a new contract in that you’re – in a sense, you’re not resetting back all the way to the beginning of the program, but you’re resetting the relationship between the customer and the industry from a performance standpoint. And how you did on the last contract definitely influences the way that contract looks. And that’s why we kind of, as we transition into these programs at the beginning of the contracts we become pretty conservative again. The last ship of Block III, we expect to do really well. The first ship of Block IV, we’re going to be pretty conservative on. That’s just the way we do it and I think that that’s indicative of the way the business arrangement with our customer works. And I think that – I think that’s probably how you could see that. In the normal course of business inside of a single contract, you should – if you have a multi-ship contract, you should see much better performance at the end of that program than you see at the beginning of that program. But then when you go and reset it for the next contract, you’re going to start all over again.
Robert Spingarn: So that makes sense. So, on a multiyear or multi-ship contract we think of all the ships in there as kind of the same way we would think of a single ship on a single ship contract?
Michael Petters: Right. That’s right. The multiyear that we have with the DDGs, for instance, that will be another – not only will we reset based on performance, but we’re going to go compete it again. So that creates a whole new set of performance parameters for that next multiyear.
Robert Spingarn: But like on the LPDs, it would be one at a time. So there it would be a different dynamic?
Michael Petters: Right. When you’re only doing one ship on the contract, your opportunity – the mistakes that I’ve seen and been involved with in my career have been where you have one ship following, you do an LPD and then you do another LPD, or you do a carrier and then you do another carrier. And you get out in front of your headlights in terms of risk retirement on the second ship before you’ve actually retired the risk. I think that’s the real problem that you have with the one ship contracts is you can get out in front of yourself if you’re not careful. Our system and our approach that we’ve adopted is fairly conservative and we do our best not to get out in front of ourselves on those single-ship contracts.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. That’s all I have.
Michael Petters: So as an example on the 79, we’re hitting our milestones on the 79 and we’re pleased with progress there. But we’re not about to take a victory lap on it, because we still got 80% of that ship to go. And we’re going to be pretty conservative because we have a good sense of all the things that could not be retired between now and the delivery of the ship.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thanks, Mike.
Michael Petters: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And I’m showing no further questions. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mike Petters for any further remarks.
Michael Petters: Thanks everybody for joining us today and thanks for your interest in our company. We continue to be consistent with what our path to 2020 strategy is. We’re going to execute in our core business. We’re going to continue to grow our services. We think that that’s going to generate more cash for our shareholders and more value for our company. And so we’re excited about the recent announcements and transaction, and we’re really excited about the future of this business. We thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This completes today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-08-04 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Kyla. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, Corporate Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also, in their remarks today Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including certain segment and adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at HuntingtonIngalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I’ll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. We released second quarter 2016 financial results this morning that reflects strong overall operating performance driven by program execution at Ingalls. So let me share some highlights starting on page 3 of the presentation. Sales of $1.7 billion were down 3% from last year, while diluted EPS was $2.80 for the quarter compared to $3.20 last year. But note that last year’s EPS included a benefit of $1.80 per share for an insurance litigation settlement and a goodwill impairment charge of $0.96 per share. Free cash flow was $121 million, and we ended the quarter with approximately $850 million of cash on the balance sheet. We received $900 million in new contract awards, resulting in backlog of approximately $21 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $13 billion is funded. Regarding activities in Washington, House and Senate conferees have begun the process of reconciling FY2017 Defense Policy Bill and measured progress is also being made in the markup before consideration of respective appropriations bills. We are encouraged by the strong bipartisan support for Navy and Coast Guard shipbuilding programs in the various committee markups and bills, so remain concerned about the prospect of a long term continuing resolution as well as the implications of returning to a sequester top line for defense spending after the two-year Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ends. Given the Navy's firm commitment to funding the higher replacement program, a sequester top line would create significant funding challenges across the Navy's budget that could severely impact a broad array of shipbuilding and ship repair programs. We will continue to be vocal about this situation so that all stakeholders are aware of the implications to HII and the shipbuilding industrial base. Now, let me share a few operational highlights. At Ingalls, risk retirement resulting from delivery of LPD-26 at John P. Murtha drove another strong quarter. The team is preparing for delivery of DDG-113 Johnson and NSC-6 Munro, both expected by the end of the year. They also continue to leverage lessons learned in the benefits of serial production across all of their programs. In addition, the announcement that Ingalls was selected to build LHA-8 and receive the majority of the LX(NYSE:R) design work was a very positive development that positions Ingalls well for the future. At Newport News, we continue to work closely with our Navy customer on CVN-78 Ford and to establish the appropriate path to delivery. We are also ensuring that these and all of the lessons learned from the Ford are leveraged to mitigate potential impact of CVN-79 Kennedy, which continues to perform in line with our expectations. Shifting to submarines, the Virginia-class program continues to perform well as the team prepares for the expected delivery of SSN-787 Washington, the 14th Virginia-class submarine, by the end of the year. And finally, the team continues to make progress toward completion of the CVN-72 Lincoln refueling overhaul and CVN-65 Enterprise inactivation and is actively working with the Navy to determine the appropriate path for redelivery for both of those ships. So in closing, I am very pleased with the results for the first half of the year and our long term outlook for the business remains unchanged. We continue to execute well on our shipbuilding businesses and are moving forward with capital projects that are increasing efficiency and enhancing affordability for our customers. And as always, we remain laser-focused on program execution, risk retirement and cash generation that creates long term sustainable value for our shareholders. That concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?
Christopher Kastner: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Today, I’ll review our second quarter consolidated and segment results. But before I do, to make the comparisons clear, let me remind you of a couple of non-recurring items we adjusted for in the second quarter 2015. In the second quarter 2015, we received $150 million in cash for an insurance litigation settlement. As a result of the settlement, Ingalls’ revenues declined $13 million and operating income increased $136 million. Additionally, in the second quarter 2015, we took a $59 million goodwill impairment charge in the other segment. Where applicable, the numbers I discuss today will be compared to the adjusted second quarter 2015 numbers. Please refer to the slides posted on our Investor Relations website for more information. Starting with our consolidated results on slide 4 of the presentation, total revenues in the quarter of $1.7 billion decreased $58 million or 3.3% than the second quarter of 2015, driven primarily by lower volumes at Newport News. Segment operating income in the quarter increased $18 million to $184 million and segment operating margin increased 138 basis points to 10.8% from the second quarter last year. Total operating income in the quarter increased $25 million to $217 million and total operating margin improved 184 basis points to 12.8%. These increases were due primarily to strong operating performance at Ingalls and the favorable FAS/CAS adjustment. Turning to slide 5, cash from operations were $169 million in the quarter after we funded the remaining $114 million of the planned $167 million discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans for 2016. Free cash flow was $121 million. Capital expenditures were $48 million or 2.8% of revenues in the quarter compared to $29 million in the second quarter last year. Our CapEx spend is typically back end loaded for the fiscal year, so we continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be between 3.5% to 4.5% of revenues. Additionally, we repurchased approximately 239,000 shares at a cost of $36 million during the quarter and paid dividends of $0.50 per share or $24 million, bringing our cash balance at the end of the quarter to $852 million. Now to segment results on slide 6 of the presentation, Ingalls revenues of $585 million increased 4.7% from the same period last year, driven by higher volumes on the DDG and LPD programs and partially offset by lower volume on the NSC program. Operating margin in the quarter of 15% increased 395 basis points over second quarter 2015, primarily due to higher risk retirement on LPD-26. Turning to slide 7 of the presentation, Newport News’ second quarter revenues of $1.1 billion decreased 6.5% from the second quarter last year due to lower volume on aircraft carriers CVN-78 and CVN-72 as well as lower volumes on the VCS Block III boats. Operating margin in the quarter was 9.4%, which was relatively flat with the second quarter 2015. Moving on to the other segment on slide 8 of the presentation, this segment generated an operating loss of $6 million on revenues of $27 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $5 million on revenues of $35 million in the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower volumes in oil and gas services and contract mix. The operating loss in the second quarter of 2016 included $1 million of restructuring costs as we continue to look for ways to take cost out of the segment. Now, let me talk about pension. Through the end of the quarter of the second quarter, our year to date return on assets was approximately 6% compared to our expected return on assets assumption for 2016 of 7.5%. Also, our pension discount rate dropped approximately 70 basis points from the rate at the beginning of the year of 4.73%. Based on the pension sensitivity we provided in our 2015 10-K, for every 25 basis point decrease in discount rate, our FAS expense would increase by $19 million from the 2016 estimates. This incremental decrease in the discount rate would also increase our pension liability by approximately $215 million. Again, this is assuming all things being equal to the assumptions used to determine the FAS expense for 2016. Now, let me provide you with an update on Avondale, we officially closed the facility in October 2014. In connection with the closure, we incurred restructuring and closure costs including severance and relocation expenses as well as asset write down cost. We’ve been working with the customer since the closure of the facility to recover these costs. As we approach the expiration date for the statute limitations to make a claim, we wanted to preserve our rights. So in June, we submitted a formal request to the customer asking for a final decision on the matter. The customer has up to 60 days to either provide a decision or inform us of how long it will take them to render their decision. We'll keep you updated as we go through this process with the customer. To summarize, this was a solid quarter and a good first half of the year. While positive performance continues at Ingalls, we'll continue to see volume and margin pressure in Newport News as we focus on delivering the three aircraft carriers. With that said, we continue to expect total revenues in fiscal year 2016 to be relatively flat to 2015 and segment operating margin in shipbuilding to be in the 9T to 10% range. That concludes my remarks for the quarter. I’ll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Kyla, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company.
Gautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could quantify what the cash contribution in the pension recognizing that’s discretionary if you were to [indiscernible] for next year, what the cash contribution would be?
Christopher Kastner: It's really too early for cash contributions for next year. We'll assess that as we move through the year. As you know, we've been concerned about the updated mortality tables in 2017. It looks like based on the IRS not submitting those yet or making those available that could move to 2018. So we're watching that very closely and we'll be able to discuss that with you at our year end call.
Gautam Khanna: And then I was wondering if you could also talk a little bit about CVN-78, what if any exposure you guys may have to the delays, just wondering I mean I imagine they are accrued for, but there's a lot in the press, so I was just wondering if you could set the record straight?
Christopher Kastner: I don't really want to comment about the delivery. I will say the ship is essentially done and in the quarter we had no material adjustments related to that shift. So Mike, do you want to comment about the delivery date or the schedule?
Michael Petters: Sure. I mean, our job is to get the ship ready to go as soon as it's ready and the team there is doing a tremendous job of doing that. We've talked about the test program and the challenge of the lead ship in general and this one in particular and we're working through every day down there. It's an adventure. Our objective right now is to get the ship gone as fast as we can. The Navy has posted a schedule. We're working very hard to support that schedule and believe it to be achievable, but recognize that it is a lead ship and it’s a test program and we're working our way through it.
Gautam Khanna: But just to be clear, your financial exposure to any of these kind of last second delays that are happening is well covered because of cost swap, these are not things that you are actually causing, is that a fair assessment or not?
Christopher Kastner: That's fair, but you have to assess it every quarter. We know now and we assessed it in Q2 and our profit assumptions assume that. So the shift, like I said, is essentially build, we're coming through test issues not only on government furnished property, but for the balance of the shift. So we think we have it captured now, but you have to go through completing delivery and you can finally understand what your final margin projections will be.
Michael Petters: And every system is unique in that some systems are government furnished, some systems are systems that we have done, some systems are that our suppliers have done. And so in every circumstance, you have to evaluate who's accountable and how will that accountability be assessed. And so the fact that it's a cost plus contract means that the cost of the work is covered, but then the overall impact of it still have to be assessed on a system by system basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: I was wondering if you could provide how much EAC adjustments were particularly at Ingalls since the margin there was one of the highest I've ever seen for shipbuilding?
Christopher Kastner: The non-recurring or cume adjustments in the quarter were 91 positive and 17 negative and of that net it's about 70/30 Ingalls.
George Shapiro: And then maybe for Mike, I mean if you could comment a little bit more in the challenging Newport News that you talked about for the second half, I guess [indiscernible] I know you’ve talked about for a while.
Michael Petters: We’ve been talking the fact that we have these three carriers to deliver and we've got a gap between the delivery of the Lincoln and the arrival of the George Washington caused by the budget process back in 2012 that kind of created that challenge. We've got three carrier deliveries that are essentially on top of each other, which means that you don't have one delivery team. You have three delivery teams and that's quite a challenge for the business. We've been talking about that for several quarters now. This is the kind of business where you can see it coming. You can anticipate it; you can plan for it; but you still got to grind your way through it. And right now through probably the second half of next year, Newport News is going to be grinding their way through this. You get to the other side of that though with the Virginia-class program, the agreement on the Ohio replacement program, a contract that we have for the Kennedy which is executing well, the contract that we just signed for the enterprise which is the ship after Kennedy which delivers in 2027 and you have George Washington here in refueling and you have the planning for Stennis beginning. Yeah, it's a grinding time for Newport News right now, but the horizon is really bright for that shipyard. And so we're excited about where this is going to go. We're just kind of grinding right now for the next year or so.
George Shapiro: Any way you could quantify what you think the margin risk might be for Newport in this period?
Christopher Kastner: I think the best way to think about it is for the year and over the next five years, it’s really 9% to 10% return on sales. But I hate to try to quantify it at Newport News.
Michael Petters: You've seen now in five and a half years of this that to quote, this is pretty lumpy and things move around quite a bit and to try to handicap where things might be next quarter or even the second half of the year can be a bit challenging, especially given the dynamic that's at Newport News right now. But our long term prospect and view and perspective just does not change. The healthy business in shipbuilding is going to operate in a blended way across time at a 9% to 10% range and we think that's very predictable. We're committed to that and we've got everybody pulling on the road to make that happen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi: Mike, you mentioned kind of the risk around continuing resolution, I'm wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color as to where you see your exposure there? What programs specifically you think could be impacted?
Michael Petters: For us we’re probably not terribly impacted by the continuing resolution and that there's not a lot of new starts, that's the real issue with continuing resolutions. If there is a new start, it can hold up the start of the program. For us, it's more about the carryover from one year to the next and the consistency and giving that giving the Pentagon a perspective that they can go ahead and do the strategic planning that they need to do. Fundamentally, I just think it's that process for us to have a continuing resolution instead of a budget and in the main, we're starting to rely on continuing resolutions way too much and our concern here is that the continuing resolution may actually be longer than December, it may go into the next administration which just creates a whole lot more uncertainty. And so we would rather see this get closed out as quick as it can.
Joseph DeNardi: Chris, just on the discussions you're having with the Navy over Avondale, is this just kind of the standard practice of business or is there disagreement in one facet of the negotiations that’s causing that to maybe take a little bit longer to get done?
Christopher Kastner: There's obviously a disagreement between the parties or we would have to settle. So we're up against statute limitations and we thought it made sense to protect our rights to get it into a more formal process. Really the last thing you want to do and it's unfortunate and it could delay recovery a bit, but we thought it was the right thing to do to protect our rights there.
Joseph DeNardi: Could you quantify maybe how much is being disputed of the total recovery?
Christopher Kastner: I’d really rather not quantify it at this point. We’ll get more visibility when we get their final decision and we'll have to assess that. And then we'll communicate to you any impact that we may have.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton: Chris, I was hoping to circle around pension just real quick, you gave us a sensitivity in spot rate and where you are in ROA year to date, but obviously as a starting point would have to know what your plan was for 2017 on a FAS/CAS basis? Was that planned to be down in this, the headwind to that being down or FAS/CAS might be up, the headwinds being up?
Christopher Kastner: Obviously we haven't provided 2017 numbers for FAS/CAS adjustment yet. You're probably aware; I think you're aware that that’s the last year harmonization. So it was relatively consistent all things being equal, but like I said we haven't provided guidance and we'll be able to come to that over the balance of the year and give that to you beginning of next year. A lot of things moving in connection, we don't like to get ahead of ourselves on it.
Myles Walton: So just for clarity though, you said last year harmonization meaning that CAS would rise again proportional to what we saw in 2016 or it would – or 2016 was the last year?
Christopher Kastner: I don't want to speculate, right, proportionately, but it is the last year harmonization. So your CAS cost should be higher than your FAS expense for sure.
Myles Walton: And Mike, so you sort of announced this, but I want to ask it in a different way. The CVN-79 versus the CVN-78, obviously you’re under fixed price for CVN-79 versus the CVN-78, you’ve got the realization of challenges on CVN-78. Just from a work share perspective and kind of hiving off risk, is the GSE portion on the CVN-79 the same as it was on the CVN-78 such that whatever problems that are arising from the GSE, the risks that are materializing on CVN-78 are similarly as rolled off as they could be on CVN-79?
Michael Petters: That's right. There are some of the GSE that would ordinarily have migrated over to CSE contractor furnished by the second ship. But Myles, if you remember, as we negotiated that contract we were working our way through the lead ship and so there were several items that we decided to leave with the government decided to leave them as GSE for the second ship that ultimately down the road what I would expect would become contract furnished. But for CVN-79, it's about the same.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein: Mike, just maybe a big picture question for you. When you think about your balance and was this something we’ve talked about little bit in the past, how are you thinking about potential M&A going forward?
Michael Petters: I think our strategy that we laid out at our investors conference last year is the same, it hasn’t changed. Our focus is on executing in our core business. We're looking to grow our services business in support of the Navy and the Department of Energy. If we have opportunities to do selected M&A in those areas that would make sense to help us do those two things then we would take a look at it. Quite frankly what we're dealing with today is that, I mean we're always scanning and we're always looking, valuations are pretty high and so it's kind of hard to come through the part where – the first question we ask ourselves is why are we the better owner and it's kind of challenging given some of the valuations that are out there today that we could really make the case that we're such a better owner that we would create the value that we need to create. So we're thinking about it. We're scanning for it. We're looking, but we also put in – I think we communicated pretty clearly that we're not going to do M&A unless it meets our financial requirements and we're going be very disciplined about that.
Ronald Epstein: Just as a follow on, are there any international opportunities or is that simply you’re not interested in it?
Michael Petters: I don't want to be terribly specific, but I think internationally where it would make sense in support of our primary customer is – if it helps the US Navy do a better job somewhere then we can think about that, but beyond that I'm not so sure that we're terribly interested in that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Sam Pearlstein: I was wondering if you could talk about the LHA/TAO competition and just I guess first is what is the impact of LHA and then second the fact that Ingalls was awarded so many more hours on LXR, does that – and that would imply you bid a lower cost, I’m just trying to think about what that means for your cost structure versus your competitor or is it something about the margins that you're willing to accept versus them?
Michael Petters: No, I think that there's a lot of variables in this competition beyond just the raw price shoot out. The risk registers on the two programs were very different. The budgets that were allocated to those programs from the government side were very different. The capabilities of the competitors to execute the work was very different. And so I think the confluence of all of those things together and there's probably a half a dozen other variables that go into it, the confluence of all of those things kind of drove the situation to come out the way that it did. We’re very happy with the way that it came out. I would certainly not draw the conclusion that we're willing to do something on the margins that is less than our competitors. I think that the blending of risk and cost and capability drove the decision to go the way that it did. And we're very happy with the way that turned out obviously.
Sam Pearlstein: And if I can follow up on the CapEx, just it continues to seem to ramp up at a slower rate than we always think and I guess are projects just getting pushed out, is it that you're finding more efficiencies and you're not needing to spend as much as you thought, what's happening there?
Christopher Kastner: Sam, so we spent $48 million in the quarter, we’re at about 2.5% for the year. I still expect 3.5% to 4.5% the projects are started and it's going to ramp towards the back end of the year. There are some large invoices and some large expenditures that are going to take place on some of these significant capital projects. So projects are authorized or on schedule, it's just going to ramp throughout the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason Gursky: Kind of explaining what's going to happen in the second half of the year at Newport News, I'm wondering you could shift gears and maybe talk a little bit about Ingalls and puts and takes – transpire at Ingalls over that same time period.
Michael Petters: Ingalls is kind of in the crunch of ship delivery right now. I mean, there's a couple of ships that are going to trials and delivery between now and the end of the year which is going to be very exciting for them. And it's going to be more the same. I mean, the bigger issue at Ingalls frankly with the execution that's going on today in serial production, the big issue there is capturing the next work, getting LPD-28 started, working our way through the acceleration of LXR and/or LPD-29 and getting LHA-8 off to a good start. I mean that's really the work that the team there will be trying to – they have to get that right in the next six to nine months to set themselves up to be years after that. But without getting too far out in front of our headlights, I mean we're doing really well there and we've got a couple of ship deliveries coming up. So we expect it will continue to do well.
Jason Gursky: And then shifting gears back to the Virginia-class program, I know the wish list is to continue on at a rate of two a year. Can you just let us know, or help us understand when we will know for sure, from a funding perspective and a contract perspective, that that's what's actually going to happen? When do we need to see the funding from Congress? And when would we expect to see a contract into you guys that gives us some really good comfort that two a year is the plan?
Michael Petters: You kind of faded out there at the end, but I think you're trying to get at the two per year in the Virginia-class program and when do we know for sure and I've been around the business long enough to believe that you don't ever really know for sure until you have a contract in hand. But I mean the reality is that if we were at two per year and the next time that there was a plan to not be at two per year was in 2021 when we funded the – when the government's going to fund the first Ohio Replacement Program ship itself beyond the design. And in this year's budget deliberation, that's the way the budget got presented to the Hill, the Hill said that they would really like to see a second submarine in 2021. The Navy said they'd like to see that too. The industry said that would be great for us too. So everybody agrees that having a second ship in 2021 would be a good thing. I think the next time you get to see whether that's actually made any progress or not is when the next budget gets submitted to the Hill in February or March of next year. Now I have mentioned all of you, I admit to being a bit parochial and biased here, but I do believe that when nations are challenged with the cost of their navy, they build more submarines and I believe that the pressure on submarines is always going to be up not down and so I would expect – I believe that we're going to be at two per year for as far as we can see. But each time we come up where that the next opportunity to drop to one moves inside the five-year plan, there's going to have to be things done to fix that. And so you're seeing that happen on the 21 ship now. And it'll be a couple of years before the next one has to be dealt with and so that's the way I see it playing now. We're geared up and ready and the agreement on the Ohio Replacement Program anticipates that the delivery schedules for these ships will have to be adjusted to accommodate the delivery of the Ohio Replacement. I mean, you've got to separate the budgeting process from the execution process. Budgeting is how do you fit all of this stuff into an appropriation; the execution is how do you actually deliver all those ships that have to deliver in the same year. But the agreement on Ohio Replacement actually anticipates that we're going to have some discussions about who's going to do what deliveries to make sure that we get it all done. So I think the industrial base is working together really well on this. I think the Navy and the Congress are working together really well on this and I'm very optimistic that we're going to be there for as far as we can see.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.
Peter Skibitski: Mike, I'm just trying to think through – I think the award for LPD-28 and NSC-9 are still set for the second half. You've got LHA-8 now, and LX(R) is in place. So I'm just wondering how you are thinking about your revenue visibility through 2020 at this point, just because it seems like there's an awful lot in place for you now. So I'm just wondering how you are thinking about that and maybe if there's anything else that you need to fall into place.
Michael Petters: I think first of all you start talking about revenue in shipbuilding, you've got to figure out what's going to happen with sequestration and what's going to happen with how they pay for Ohio Replacement Program. We had a good situation this year in the budget request in terms of things that needed to get done on the Ohio Replacement are funded and it did not affect any of the HII programs. The question is, is that going to be the case going forward and the visibility around LXR is that we're doing more design work than we had a few months ago before the award. But what we don't have right now is we need to either have that ship accelerated or we need to have another LPD in the line and we don't have either of those right now. So visibility on that is still a little bit murky. So given all of that, I think we're going to stick with our forecast that through 2020 our shipbuilding revenue is going to be relatively flat.
Peter Skibitski: And then just one follow-up, how are you feeling about the likelihood that we'll get an add from Congress on NSC-10 at this point?
Michael Petters: There's a lot of support in the Congress for what the Coast Guard is doing and there's a lot of success on what the NSCs are being able to provide to the Coast Guard. I think there's a lot of moving parts, but we remain optimistic and supportive of the program. So we'll see how this end game works itself out, but that’s certainly our objective.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: So Mike, when I look at Ingalls and I look over the last three years, the margins have ticked up from, call it, 10% in 2014 to 11% in 2015. This year is at 14.5%. You have characterized this business even earlier on this call as a 9% to 10% business, but you've also said you've got a lot of delivering ships here, and you are retiring risk at a rapid rate. So with that as the backdrop and with new ships coming, how do margins trend from here rest of this year at Ingalls and into next year? Have you used up a lot of that EAC reserve? Is there any way for us to track this and measure it and project going forward?
Michael Petters: I’d just remind you what we've said about the 9% to 10% range. If you are operating outside of that range for any period of time you have to ask yourself why. If you are above the range, it probably means that you have a lot of mature programs and you’re harvesting pretty well, but the fundamental thing you need to be focused on is what's the new work? If you're below the range, you're probably doing a whole lot of new work and you've got to let those programs mature. At Ingalls today, we are have mature work going on in the LPD programs. The LHA-7 now has come along. The DDGs are coming along and the NSCs are coming along, all really well. The question in front of them is, okay, we’re harvesting really well, but what's the new work look like. So LHA-8 was a really big deal from that standpoint because we really needed to have get through that and get that ship to under contract. We really need to get LPD-28 under contract. We need to sort out the LPD-29 and the LXR opportunity in the way that that plays out. And we need to keep the destroyers on track. I mean, the destroyers pro comp at two per year is really important for us to keep that on track. So a lot of the activity at Ingalls, we're doing really well executing, a lot of the activity is on the front end, is on the new business piece of it. In terms of handicapping the next quarter or the next two quarters, I just don't do that because that's not the nature of our business. We have great quarters. We have lumpiness there, we’ll have lots of risk retirement in one quarter and not so much in the next. And so I’m a little reluctant to go there. But in general, the focus is what's the new work coming at Ingalls so that we can maintain the healthiness of that shipyard. Chris, you got anything you want to add to that?
Christopher Kastner: Rob, I will say the positive adjustment in the quarter at Ingalls was dominated by LPD-26, it had a really great delivery and we were able to retire some risk there. I would not expect that over the balance of the year.
Robert Spingarn: Chris, is there a way to quantify or to measure what's left in the reserve as we go forward for the various programs, just to give us a better sense of maturity levels and remaining opportunity?
Christopher Kastner: We don't disclose that type of information. It would be really tough to do and really doesn't serve much of a purpose. We continue to believe that the 9% to 10% return on sales makes sense across the portfolio.
Robert Spingarn: I think it does; it's just timing. And when you back out these EACs, you're closer to 6% this quarter, so it's obviously a hugely important element. So anyway, I just wanted to throw that out there as something to think about. I just had one other question, if I could. Given the ORP and the work split, with the majority going to the other yard, Mike, how do you think about any future opportunity to increase your work share on VCS and does that maybe come into play with the multi-year being discussed?
Michael Petters: I think the agreement that we have is that we're going to shift some deliveries to Newport News during those times when we're trying to deliver the Ohio Replacement platforms from Electric Boat. I mean I think that's all part of the deal. How that gets quantified? I mean, the first time you're going to be dealing with that situation is going to be after 2025. I think 2027 or 2028 will be the first time that that comes into play. And so I'm not spending a whole lot of time right now trying to figure out exactly where that line gets, what we are trying to figure out right now is how do we invest in that program and make sure that we can do it as efficiently as possible and then we’ll see where the chips fall.
Robert Spingarn: So where you are a 50% player on submarines now, that will drop at least in the early years here during the development work on ORP and it won't necessarily get offset until about 2025?
Michael Petters: I don't know that, I mean if you look at the entire submarine industrial base with the Ohio Replacement Program and the Virginia-class program, I'm not sure that I would go so far as to say that that's a 50% program for us overall. I think it all depends also on what happens to the build rate on VCS. So I'm okay with that given that aligns with our work and aligns with our capital investment.
Robert Spingarn: I wasn't implying that you were 50% on ORP; I'm saying you are 50% on VCS and less on ORP, and that you would average at a lower level when you put the two together. And is there an interest on Huntington's part to become a 50% player down the road by raising your VCS share to offset the lower share on ORP? I know that was confusing, but I think you follow it.
Michael Petters: Our only interest is working with our teammate in the Navy to make sure we produce these platforms as efficiently as possible. If we do that, then it'll be good for us and it'll be good for the industry and it’ll be good for the Navy.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: Mike, as you are talking about investing in ORP, I'm trying to get a sense of what the scale of that investment is, the investment that you're going to have to make over the next few years and then how you think about tying that in with some of the other investments, some of which you just named, and how this CapEx trajectory looks like. Are we looking at something in the 4% range for an extended period of time as you work through these new programs?
Christopher Kastner: Let me take that one, Doug. It's $1.5 billion over the next five years and then retching down to the 2% to 2.5% subsequent to that and included in that is the ORP investment.
Douglas Harned: And then separately, when you look at CVN-78 and the delivery, do you see much of risk of any post-delivery costs after that ship is delivered?
Christopher Kastner: I think that depends, but I think it'll be the normal situation that we have after ship delivery. There may be some work that we will deliver the ship to go finish after the ship delivers and maybe some of that, but I think it’d be on the margins.
Douglas Harned: So it's not something that you are particularly worried about at this stage?
Christopher Kastner: I'm not worried about that. I mean, to me right now the issue is can you get through the systems testing so that you have a full up ship ready to go to sea when it's time to go to sea. That's what our focus is on. And the team is working really hard to make sure we have that done. The ship will go to sea, it’ll do some qualifications after delivery. Eventually, it comes back in for a post-shakedown availability and there's already being stuff identified today that is stuff that we're going to want to do during that timeframe. So that work packages is already being worked on. But that's just a normal way that these ships join the fleet. They go through this pretty turbulent period to become part of the greatest suite in the world and so this is all part of getting them ready to do that.
Douglas Harned: But presumably, once – if you have nailed this on delivery – well, that's the key here, there's probably not a huge risk of residual costs down the road post-delivery.
Christopher Kastner: I mean delivery is a big event, there's no doubt about it from a cost standpoint.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
Unidentified Analyst: It's actually [Matt] on for David. I was wondering if you could comment about your UPI business, it looks like the lost rate there's been relatively stable. When do you think that business actually breakeven and what has to happen to get there?
Michael Petters: I mean obviously the business itself is being dramatically affected by the environment that it's in and we're waiting to see capital projects get turned back on by their key customers. They've continued to win work and our strategy of preserving capability to stay close to those customers is working, but the work that they've won doesn't really kick in until the end of this year or the beginning of next year. And so just like that whole industry everybody's trying to figure out how is the best way to survive and we're working with them to make sure we do that. As far as the timing goes, I didn't know the timing of this business before we got into it. So I’d be the last person you should be asking about the timing now.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just one more on tax rate, where do you tax rate beyond this year? Is it much different from kind of 2015, ex the Q1 benefit?
Christopher Kastner: So 30% to 32% for the year, dominator the reduction related to stock comp deduction that rolls through the income statement instead of how it used to go through the balance sheet. As you get less stock options or equity vesting that could raise a bit, so I think this is probably as low as it gets and it could go up from here. But we'll give you more visibility when we do the year end call.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Is the risk to Newport News that you've highlighted in the back half such that the framework needs more net positive cumulative catch-up adjustments at Ingalls whereby that total nets out to a 9% or slightly better shipbuilding segment margin or is it more Newport News is a little below 9%, Ingalls a little above 9%, and you'll see what happens with positive cumulative catch-up adjustments?
Christopher Kastner: We do these adjustments when we evaluate EACs and when we retire risk. And so they come about the way that they come about. We certainly believe that over time, this is why we don't try to do this on a quarter by quarter basis because in any given quarter they may not match. But over a period of time, they will match. And so our sense of it today is that our shipbuilding business will be in the 9% to 10% range over a reasonable amount of time. And we've kind of described in some detail today that over the next 12 to 18 months Newport New is kind of grinding on that a little bit and right now Ingalls is doing really well. We don't see that being dramatically different, but it's important for Ingalls to get the new work in and it's important for Newport News to be successful in grinding through these deliveries. So that's what we're focused on.
Noah Poponak: I mean, I ask – it’s not an effort to ask for timing of cume catches; it's more the Newport News risk in the back half you've highlighted such that you would need those in the back half to be at 9% or not, if that makes sense?
Michael Petters: We're going to have to come through the risk retirements on all the programs every quarter and so we hate to handicap that.
Noah Poponak: Is the hesitation in quantifying pension contribution beyond 2016 simply the uncertainty around the timing of a mortality table change or is it really many moving pieces that have wide ranges of possible outcomes?
Christopher Kastner: You said that very well actually. Really, the first one is the most significant, the new mortality tables would increase contribution significantly, but there are a lot of moving parts as we all know. So best not to speculate and just do the analysis throughout the year and let you guys know at the year-end call.
Noah Poponak: I think a lot of people in the investment community are coming up with large ranges of guesses on that use of word significant for the mortality piece. So I didn't know if you guys had been able to at this point hone in on some kind of order of magnitude range of that compared to the baseline or not?
Christopher Kastner: Not at this point.
Noah Poponak: And then just from there, you have a stated plan to return substantially all the free cash to shareholders. Can you just speak to – I guess that's theoretically inclusive of a pension contribution. But is there a scenario where you can still do that on a pre-pension contribution basis just because the cash generation is so consistent and the leverage is pretty low or is that not in the scenario analysis or is it somewhere in between, if you could just speak to how those ultimately tie together?
Christopher Kastner: That's not in the scenario analysis, pension rolls through free cash. So subsequent to that, we’ll return substantially all the free cash flow to shareholders in the form of at least a 10% annual increase in our dividend and the rest being share buyback. So the way the policy reads and the way we've communicated it is pension actually rolls through free cash.
Operator: And we do have a follow-up question from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: In the first quarter in the Q, you disclosed there was a $22 million EAC gain on a contract, which I assume was LPD-26. Was that comparable this quarter? And since you delivered the LPD-26 this quarter, is there that kind of upside on LPD-27 going forward?
Michael Petters: George, the majority or the most significant non-recurring adjustment in the quarter was LPD-26 delivery; you’re 100% correct there. We’ll have to see on LPD-27. That was a separately negotiated contract and we have to come to the risk retirements as we approach delivery on that ship, which will be in the year. So a little bit early on 27, we’ll have to assess that as we come through the process.
George Shapiro: And will the Q disclose the value of that like it did in the first quarter?
Michael Petters: I believe it will, yes.
Operator: At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I’d now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mike Petters for closing remarks.
Michael Petters: Thanks to all of you for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate your interest in our company. We're excited about what we've done so far and we're really excited about the future that we're building for this organization. So we look forward to continuing our conversation throughout the quarter and we'll see you on the waterfront. Thank you very much.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-05-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries’ First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.

With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Michael Petters: Thanks Dwayne, good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on today’s call. This morning we released first quarter 2016 financial results that reflects strong overall of our operating performance driven by program execution at Ingalls. So let me share some highlights starting on page three of the presentation. Sales of $1.76 billion were up 12% from last year and diluted EPS was $2.87 for the quarter compared to $1.79 last year. Segment operating margin was 9.4%, up from 8.2% last year, free cash flow was $17 million and we ended the quarter with approximately $800 million of cash on the balance sheet. We received $1 billion in new contract awards resulting in backlog of $21 billion at the end of the quarter of which $13 billion is funded. Shifting to activities in Washington, there have been a couple of developments I want to mention. First, the Navy released its Submarine unified build strategy, which outlines the framework for design and construction of the Ohio replacement program. This strategy is the result of a coordinated effort between New Port News, General Dynamics Electric Boat and the Navy. It enables the submarine industrial base to execute on the ORP, while continuing to deliver Virginia class submarines in the most cost effective manner. The arrangement specified that New Port News will build sections of ORP consistent with the sections they build on the VCS program. At the same time, New Port News will perform additional final assembly testing and delivery work on the VCS program. We are pleased with this outcome and look forward to leveraging our VCS program expertise and experience on the ORP. Next, there appears to be some interest in Congress to accelerate the start of the LXR program from 2020, which is the plan of record to either 2019 or 2018. We support LXR acceleration as it would reduce the production gap between LPD 28 and LXR and leverage the benefits of hard production lines. It also creates a predictable and steady construction schedule for our suppliers allowing them to make investments in their workforce and facilities that lowers cost and improves efficiencies. While funding for these items in the remainder of the President’s fiscal year 2017 budget request debated, our team remains engage with the Navy, Pentagon and Congress on all of our programs. Now, I will provide a few points of interest on our business segment. At Ingalls, we experienced another strong quarter as the team continues to execute well and the programs continue to reap the benefits of serial production. Results of the LHA-8 and T-AOX competition are expected to be announced by mid-year and we still expect contract towards awards for LPD 28 and NSC-9 later this year. At Newport News, CVN-78 Ford experienced some challenges in the test program that resulted in a delay of builder’s trials, while we a bit disappointed with this outcome the challenges are not out of the ordinary for the lead ship of a class as we integrate test and troubleshoot contractor and government supplied equipment and systems and bring their ship to live. I am very pleased with the condition of the ship and I am confident that the team will continue to work closely with our Navy customer to craft the best path to delivery. Regarding the other major programs at Newport News, the Virginia-class program continues to perform well and CVN-79 Kennedy ramps up while the CVN-72 Lincoln refueling overall and CVN-65 Enterprise and activation teams continue to drive these programs toward completion. At Universal Pegasus contract awards for inspection work in the field services area were recently received, which is creating a modest increase in the backlog even with these developments we will continue reviewing operations to ensure that the business is right sized for current market conditions while preserving our key customer relationships. In closing, I want to thank the HII team for another quarter of hard work and dedication and for their unwavering commitment to safety, quality, cost, and schedule. Even though there is pressure at Newport News as they prepare to complete Ford, Lincoln, and Enterprise we remained focused on program execution, risk retirement and cash generation and supporting Washington for our key ship building programs continues to create a positive long-term outlook for the business. So that concludes my remarks and I’ll now turn the call over to Chris Kastner for remarks on the financials. Chris?
Christopher D. Kastner: Thanks, Mike and good morning. Starting with our consolidated results on slide four of the presentation, revenue in the quarter of $1.76 billion increased 12.3% driven by higher volumes at Ingalls and Newport News. Segment operating income in the quarter increased 29.7% to $166 million and segment operating margin improved 126 basis points to 9.4%. Total operating income in the quarter increased 26.9% to $198 million and total operating margin improvement 129 basis points to 11.2%. These increases were due to strong operating performance at Ingalls and favorable FAS/CAS adjustments. Cash from operations was $54 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $17 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $37 million or 2% of revenues compared to $20 million in the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% of revenues. In the quarter, we contributed $53 million of the planned $167 million discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plan. We will fund the balance of the discretionary contributions in the second quarter. We repurchased approximately $367,000 shares at a cost of $48 million during the quarter and paid dividends of $0.50 per share or $24 million bringing our quarter end cash balance to $793 million. Moving on to segment results on slide five of the presentation. Ingalls revenues of $576 million increased 24.9% from the same period last year, driven by higher volumes on the DDG and LPD programs and partially offset by lower volume on the NSC program. Operating margin in the quarter of 14% increased 440 basis points over first quarter 2015. Primarily due to performance improvement and risk retirement on the LPD and DDG programs. Turning to slide six of the presentation, Newport News’s first quarter revenue of $1.15 billion increased 8.7% over the same period last year, due to resolution of changes to a commercial energy contract and higher volumes on the VCS program. The increase was partially offset by lower volumes on CVN-72 RCOH and the construction contract for CVN-78. Operating margin for the quarter was 7.7%, down 105 basis points from the same period last year due to lower risk retirement on the VCS program and lower performance on CVN-78. Now the other segment on the slide seven of the presentation. The segment generated an operating loss of $5 million on revenues of $24 million in the quarter, compared to an operating loss of $10 million on revenues of $40 million in the same period of last year. The decrease in revenues was driven by the continued decline in oil and gas service. The decrease in operating loss was due to lower restructuring cost in the quarter, compared to the restructuring cost taken in the first quarter 2015. Now let me provide you with an update on our tax rate for the year. As we’ve noted in our earnings press release this morning, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance on accounting from employee share base compensation the changes how companies for certain aspects of share based payment awards to its employees, including accounting income taxes and classification of the cash flow statement. Another new guidance income tax benefits and deficiencies will be recognize as income tax benefits or expense in the income statement, we doubt that the updated guidance effective January 1st of this year. As these are treated as discrete items, there will be volatility and variations in our tax rate during the year based on when these awards exercised and vested. For the first quarter our effective tax rate was 23.2% deferred from Federal statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to the adoption of the new guidance, which provided an income tax benefit of approximately $18 million for stock award settlement activities in the quarter. For the full-year, we now expect our effective income tax rate to be in the 30% range 32% range. That concludes my remarks for the quarter. I’ll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we get as many people through the queue as possible. Darren, I’ll turn the call over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning.
Dwayne Blake: Good morning.
Christopher D. Kastner: Good morning.
Myles Walton: I was hoping to just to start with the margins and obviously kind of divergent here. So, A, Chris could you give us the positive negative total [indiscernible] that will be Q, and; B, maybe Mike, can you talk about the sustainability of obviously not all the goodness here at Ingalls is really sustainable, but this is another third or fourth quarter in a row where you’re well aware about trend there. And then, how much of the builder delay was more of public trial delay was more of a one-time-ish impact to the Newport News margins in the quarter?
Christopher D. Kastner: Yeah. Sure, Miles, this is Chris. $76 million positive and $7 million negative for a net of $69 million.
Michael Petters: And Miles, regarding the margins, we’ve been talking for five years about the healthy ship building business has a blend of programs that will keep it in the 9% range to 10% range. What you’re getting here is a peak under the hood at how that blends sometimes works. We had some really strong risk retirements at Ingalls, we’ve worked really hard over really the last eight years to get Ingalls into a serial production mode to drive high returns in mature programs Newport News is looking at three carrier in the next-year. And so, they are a little bit out of balance and we’ve been talking about that as well. Combined though, you still have a very healthy business and this is how the healthy business works. As far as, what’s happening at Newport News specifically to the Ford we’re testing this is the lead ship of a class of ships that’s going to be out there for the next -- this ship will be out there for the next 50 years. The last time we did a lead ship aircraft carrier program was in the 1970s, so as far as the test program goes. So we have 40 years of new technology in the systems that we’re testing. We’re testing each of the systems, systems that we built, systems that the government furnished to us. We’re testing the systems themselves; we’re testing how the systems interact with the each other from a network standpoint, which is not something that was even on the table really 40 years ago. And then as the lead ship there is a whole set of tests that you do that are lead ships specific, as well as, documentation for the training of the crew that will drive the performance of a whole class of ships going forward. Our ability to predict the schedule in that environment is probably limited. What our commitment is that we’re committed to keeping the quality of that test program on track and to do it in the most efficient way, keep the cost as managed as we possibly can. And so we still believe that we are in good shape there, the ship looks great. You walk on it today its really finished ship except for the folks that are testing it and it’s not just the Newport News folks that are testing it, but the navy folks that are involved in bringing that ship to live. The ship will go to sea this summer and we are targeting a delivery in September or so. So we see this -- we are on a good path right now to drive the performance of that program all the way through to completion. So how that plays out from a schedule standpoint we’ll see. But our commitment here is to make sure the test program is run correctly and we do that as efficiently as we possibly can.
Myles Walton: Okay, that make sense. Chris, just to make sure I got it right. You said negative $7 million I think for [indiscernible] and so pretty low number which would I guess suggest that that what we are seeing in NNS is more of a underlying lower booking rate than any negative effect of [indiscernible] and maybe an absence of positives is that the correct interpretation?
Christopher D. Kastner: Yeah, I think that’s right. There is a minor adjustment on the Ford, but really just the lower booking rate.
Myles Walton: Yeah. Alright. Thanks guys.
Christopher D. Kastner: Welcome.
Operator: And our next question comes from Finbar Sheehy of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Finbar Sheehy: Good morning.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Christopher D. Kastner: Good morning.
Finbar Sheehy: I wondered if you could give us a little more on the impact of the new submarine building plan. So as you few years out of course, but when you do get the work on the ORP and then also additional work on the Virginia-Class, are we looking at that being fairly flat then revenue line for you or is it the step up or down?
Christopher D. Kastner: I think the first thing you said is this is pretty far out. So I mean the first ship is not acquired until 2021. So starting to try to predict and think through what that means for us. We are excited about being part of the program and I think the most important part of what happen here is that now that the industry and the government have decided on a path ahead not just for the Ohio-class replacement, but also how that’s going to impact the Virginia-Class program. We as a team can then go figure out how to get all of that done. I mean one thing that’s interesting is that the Navy wants to add another Virginia-Class program in 2021. At the same time that they are going to buying the Ohio-class. We strongly support that and we have to work with our partner and the government to figure out how is the most efficient way to get that done. So trying to predict how the any sort of the revenue might project, I mean a ship that gets appropriated in 2021 actually gets built over the next five or six years. And so that’s -- we are talking about 8 to 10 years from now in terms of how that plays out. It’s a really positive development for Newport News it really indicates how confident and comfortable the Navy is with the performance of the team at Newport News and executing all of the work that they are doing.
Finbar Sheehy: Great, thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is open.
John Raviv: Hi, good morning guys. It’s actually John Raviv here for Jason.
Michael Petters: Hi, John.
John Raviv: Mike, just following up on that last question Navy made some decisions how those two ships will interact. How do you see them just simply affording this in the 2020? Still kind of knock down do you think and will the Navy shipbuilding budget, where do you see things going based on this sub plan?
Michael Petters: I've said for a while now that the number one issue facing the industry is how does Ohio replacement program gets funded without squeezing out other programs. The Congress and the Navy are trying to work through a funding mechanism. There is the authorizers have come up with this idea for an account, the appropriators maybe not so much. My own view is that however it comes together, however I gets -- whatever the mechanics of getting it funded or whatever they are what’s most important is that it be funded without impacting other programs. And quite frankly that’s why our effort to take advantage of the hard production line on amphibs [ph] is really crucial. Because my own view is that if you start crowding out other programs significant auxiliary ships and amphibs that maybe even destroy or start to get impacted by the way that it gets paid for. So what matters here is that there would be extra money. I do not know how that happens. I’m watching the nation kind of wrestle with this whole idea of our strategic capacity recapitalization, it’s not just the Navy it’s the air force as well. And I’m watching the Pentagon try to take that on, it looks like they’re taking on in a positive way and there is a lot a support for it in Congress, but my guess is we’re going to talking about this every year for the next decade.
John Raviv: Well I look forward to it. And so the quick -- as a quick follow-up just on the margins I mean still fair to think that on the blended perspective, shipbuilding should be in that 9% to 10% range this year. And then beyond that as what is The Newport News looks like once Ford actually delivers.
Michael Petters: Yeah I think that the healthy business will be in the 9% to 10% range and we’re absolutely believed that before that year our shipbuilding business will be in the 9% to 10% range without any question about that. And I think that’s pretty predictable over the next out to 2020. Newport News has got three of these deliveries, they’ve got the Ford delivery, have the Link in delivery and have the Enterprise delivery kind of staked up on each other over the next year or so. And so that’s going to -- for the next 12 months or so at Newport News it’s kind of a period of transition for them. As they work through these test programs and delivery programs, and move into the production on the Kennedy the beginning of the next refueling Block IV and the submarine program. What you’ll see at Newport News is you’ll see them start to hire people again. Frankly unfortunately they’re going to be trying to hire back some of the people that we’ve had to lay off. I mean it’s fortunate that we’re trying to hire them back its unfortunate that we had to lay them off in the first place. And so Newport News long-term is setting themselves up for a pretty good run here. And it’s just we’re in a transition period right now.
John Raviv: Thanks so much.
Michael Petters: Yeah.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is open. If your phone is muted please unmute it. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Hey guys. I guess we’ve got couple of calls going at the same time, I think that’s what’s doing -- what's behind this. But I wanted to follow-up with Chris on Miles question and then Mike more a strategic for you. Chris the numbers that you gave us could you do that by segment?
Christopher D. Kastner: Yeah I could. About two third of it is Ingalls related to some major milestones they accomplished in the quarter. Builders trails in LPD 26 and then launch of LPD 27. And then a third of it at Newport News related to VCS program.
Robert Spingarn: Both for the positives and the negative?
Christopher D. Kastner: The negatives were focused in Newport News.
Robert Spingarn: Got it, okay. Mike continuing along the long-term strategic submarine plan and I recognize what I’m about to ask you is way out in the future. But we’ve had the opportunity it’s been quite a bit of time with the Navy over the past couple of months. And the latest we’re hearing about is not only do they talk about maintaining two Virginia classes alongside one ORP starting in the next decade, but now we’re hearing a lot about the retirement of the 688-Is and the fact that three or four of those retire per year starting around the same time. And they want to replace those on a like-for-like basis. So the numbers become staggering, if you start thinking about doing three or four attack submarines a year plus an ORP I have no idea how that would get paid for, but could we even capitalize for something like that?
Michael Petters: Well I think the industry could support something like that. I think what you’re talking about though is a problem -- this is not a new issue. Go back I first drew the submarine four structure curve for Newport News when Newport News shipbuilding belonged to Tenneco. And you could see that if you’re buying them back in the 80s and 90s -- 70s, 80s and 90s at three and four per year. And then in the future you’re going to be buying them at one or two per year, you’re eventually going to have reduction on force that’s going to be pretty dramatic. And if your ambition is to get back to the numbers that you had in 1990, you better start on that. Now the way you do it though is you don’t show up in 2018 and say okay I want to buy four submarines this year. What you do is you start with a long-term commitment to doing something like that and then you would add one. And you would expand the capacity of the industry in a sustainable rate. That will make the capital investment flow, that will make it efficient. That’s how you build the four structure. And quite frankly that’s why the Navy puts a 30 year plan out is because they give the industry that kind of visibility to say here is where we’re going to go. Now I don’t particularly believe that we’re ever going to get to a place where we’re building four Virginia-Class Submarines in any given year at any point in the next decade, I don't see that happening. I do see that there is a real need for submarines and that there are real capabilities out there that the Navy is trying to figure out how to replace. And so we’re working with them to try to figure out the best way to do that or Ohio Replacement is one set of capabilities, the Virginia payload module brings another set of capabilities to the platform. And so how we do it, we may not do it in the same way that we did at the four with ships. We may do it with other kinds of capabilities.
Robert Spingarn: And given that in my impression in anyways the submarine is the number one priority in the Navy. I think there were all these ships are priorities, but if they have to pick and chose, that’s the sense that we get. And I would think at some point surface ships might have to pay that bill. Are you able to resource in such a way and this is a somewhat long-term question, but could you do submarine work if needed elsewhere? I understand not all you are as our Nuclear certified. I just don't know how that’s works.
Michael Petters: Well all the nuclear work would have to continue to be done in Newport News. To try to get another shipyard whether it’s Huntington Ingalls shipyard or anybody else try to get them into a place where they are capable or qualified and certified to do nuclear work is the bridge too far. So if you’re going to expand the number of nuclear ships in the fleet is going to be done from the nuclear shipyards that exists today. Now if you think about capacity in the shipyard and I think we’ve talked about this a few times. The capacity in the shipyard is -- you think of -- a lot of times when you think about factory you think of it in terms of facilities. But the real capacity in the shipyard is the workforce. And the number of people that you have your ability to train and create that workforce, your ability to create work sites for those folks to be able to do that work. And I would point out that the both of our shipyards are at lower levels of workforce today than they were 25 years ago. And so the capacity to build up the workforce there is -- I mean we have the facilities to do it. The question is really can you create the workforce and at what pace can you do it. We’re pretty good at that, and we have some really strong views as to how fast you can build a workforce. We can build the workforce faster than the Navy can appropriate the money.
Robert Spingarn: Okay, thank you for the color.
Michael Petters: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from Noah Popnok from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Matthew Porat: Yeah hi this is Matthew Porat on for Noah. Just the division of work associated with your Ohio Replacement sort of you have the greater potential number of Virginia class. Does that have an effect on margins during that time?
Michael Petters: It’s really early to understand that at this point. We don’t even know the ORP contracting structure as of yet. And we continue to believe the 9% plus margin business makes a lot of sense.
Matthew Porat: Got you. Thanks.
Michael Petters: Yeah.
Matthew Porat: And, I guess, has the recent oil rally done anything UPI and sort of when might that start to contribute to operating income?
Michael Petters: I mean, I think it’s driving -- the thing that drives UPIs success is when their customers start reinvesting from a capital standpoint. And while the prices moves somewhat -- we haven’t seen the capital projects start back up again in any consistent way. We have seen some inspection pickup, which is -- it’s kind of a phase that we are in we’re that marketplace right now is inspecting stuff that’s been previously build. And so that’s why you see the backlog going up and that’s good work for us and we’re pretty good at it, but we haven’t seen the capital projects turned back on yet in any way to be -- so that we can predict the bottom if you will.
Matthew Porat: Got you, thanks so much.
Michael Petters: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Christopher D. Kastner: Hi, Sam.
Sam Pearlstein: Chris, can you tell us what the revenue benefit was in Newport News, you talked about a resolution of commercial contract in energy?
Christopher Kastner: Yeah, it was approximately $100 million.
Sam Pearlstein: And was there a P&L impact?
Christopher D. Kastner: Yeah, but nothing significant and worth to mentioning. It was really the resolution of a number change orders that were outstanding on that contact. So we settle it in the quarter and that caused the variance.
Sam Pearlstein: So if I took that out and I said it imputed 8.5% margin that’s about the right way to think about the ship side of it?
Christopher D. Kastner: I think, that’s fair
Sam Pearlstein: Okay. And then Mike, you talked about the LXR and I guess, I’ve seen the talk about accelerating and I guess, I’m just trying to think through as the options at LXR comes in the year or two or is there any chance we could actually get another LPD in there and still keep the LXR out where it was?
Michael Petters: I think either of those are possible. From our standpoint, what we -- our position has been that we have got a really solid production line on LPDs operating right now. What that it will end before the plan of record for LXR is in 2020 starts that the congress and the navy began to build a bridge to cover that gap with LPD 28, but LPD 28 doesn’t completely close the gap. So you really have -- you have the choice, you can either bring the other side of the bridge in closer by accelerating the LXR program or if you wanted to build another LPD that would be fine too, that will absolutely fill the gap. But either of those are reasonable alternatives from our standpoint, the decision that Navy made to make the LXR platform based on the LPD haul means that this bridging is critically important to maintain the efficiency and the effectiveness of that decision. So our point of view is, let’s make sure we finish building the bridge that LPD 28 started. LXR is the plan of record, so based on the plan of record it needs to be accelerated. If we decide to build another ship instead, I’m okay with that.
Sam Pearlstein: So, is there have been discussion leading that way or is all the discussion going to be about LXRs timing?
Michael Petters: I think, discussions going on all the time about all of this stuff, so I think the whole range of alternatives is still out there, as I said our position has been -- the bridge has been started and LPD 28 was a great move in the right direction, but it wasn’t completed.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
Pete Skibitski: Good morning guys, nice quarter.
Christopher D. Kastner: Good morning.
Michael Petters: Thank you.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, I guess Mike just to be a dead horse on the margin rate, I want to make sure I’m concluding the right thing here. So at Newport News as work through this transition over the next two to three quarters, is that fair to say that they will run a little bit below their historic norm, so you think maybe Ingalls are running a little bit above their historic norms, so you kind of net out at the segment level above 9% is that the right way think about that?
Michael Petters: I mean, I -- that’s a way to think about it, I think that both of these sites are pretty lumpy in the way that these things worked out and I mean, you’ve been with us for the whole five years, you know that trying to predict what happens in any particular quarter is -- that’s a pretty risky project. What I would tell you is that by the end of the year the shipbuilding business will still be in the 9% to 10% range.
Pete Skibitski: Okay, fair enough. And then just one follow-up if I could on the CapEx ramp plan. So has the ramp actually begun, is that fair to say how you guys kind of approving projects as part of the plan and are you still holding this year to that 3.5% and 4.5% guidance?
Christopher D. Kastner: Yeah, Pete. We are right on schedule. We spent $37 million in the quarter and we are on path for 3.5% to 4.5% for the year.
Pete Skibitski: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Roman Schweizer of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Roman Schweizer: Thank you very much. Good morning, guys.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Christopher D. Kastner: Good morning.
Roman Schweizer: So just quick question on Ohio-class obviously design activity is starting to ramp up and I guess the unified build strategy kind of covers more the production aspect of it. Can you describe how you guys are participating in the design perhaps for the modules or section that you guys were going to do?
Michael Petters: Sure. I mean that’s what’s important about that build strategy was to optimally you would like to be in the place where whoever is building that part of the ship is doing the design work for that part of the ship and is also going to handle the procurement of equipment and material for this parts of the ship. So getting clarity around all of that on the front end of this is pretty important to the design piece. There is -- as we go forward that’s kind of the notional plan there will be puts and takes where there is some integrated systems that kind of carryover from one place to another. So we got to work through those things. But we did that on Virginia-Class, we actually did it on Ford as well. We had some support from the designers and general dynamics to help us do the Ford early on based on their experience with Virginia-Class program. So the two companies are really good at sorting out this design stuff and who is the best person to do it because that’s where both committed to driving the efficiency of the program. But notionally and nominally it’s going to be -- you are going to end up doing the design, going to do most of the design for the work that you are going to build and you are going to do most of the procurement for the stuff that you are going to build.
Roman Schweizer: Great, thank you. And just as a follow-up, I think at the beginning of the year you guys were about 16% complete with Kennedy probably few points better than that now. Can you just maybe describe a little bit how you guys are tracking the plan I mean obviously the learning curve compared to Ford is going to be a little bit different probably a lot different in what you proposed under the contract. But how is that about 20% into the program how are you guys doing?
Michael Petters: Actually that’s a great question; I appreciate the chance to talk about that. The Kennedy is not quite 20% complete yet. We took a substantial learning target or challenge on the labor side of that program and at about little less than 20% we are exactly on budget on labor. On the material side we are very -- and we are very happy about that, I mean that’s a learning curve, that is pretty -- was really indicative of the lessons that we learned from putting Ford together. The team as it transitioned its lessons learned into new facilities and new work teams and validating the work plans, getting the material side of it sorted out that has been going exceptionally well. Material side is essentially on budget. We are not quite -- I think we are about two-thirds committed, we are about little more than a third out and we are doing pretty well there too. We have a cap on Kennedy as well a cost capital in Kennedy as well for the whole program. Our piece of it we’re being very successful in supporting our piece of the cap there. So we are excited about the way that Kennedy has already started and that’s attributed to what the guys are doing down there on both the Ford and the Kennedy.
Roman Schweizer: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Kristine Liwag: Hi, good morning. It’s actually Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Christopher D. Kastner: Good morning.
Kristine Liwag: With the $1.5 billion in CapEx over the next five years, I was wondering if you would see similar uptick in company funded R&D and what’s your discussion with the Navy? How did you think about risk sharing during a development phase?
Michael Petters: First of all, I think, on the R&D side of it what probably is a little bit different for us is that 80% of the R&D that we do is tied more to process than it is the technology in terms of the next gadget or anything like that. And the process investment that we make quite frankly is right now being driven by the capital improvements that we are making. So if you really wanted to be a poetic about it you would say that the capital improvements that we are making in our business, capital investment that we are making in our business is really R&D for this kind of business. I know that’s not exactly right, but that’s a way to think about that is you build the drydock or you can build an aircraft career you have created something that nobody else has and that’s -- it's capital, but in the same way that a new gadget would be something that nobody else has from an R&D standalone. As far as risk sharing goes, it just kind of depends on the program and what you are trying to get done and the Navy is whenever we sit down to have a discussion with the Navy about construction of the platform, we are in a discussion we all know how much has been appropriated for the platform, we are really in a discussion about how we are going to allocate risk on that between the government and the company to get us to a place where we have a reasonable contract that makes sense for both parties. If we are in some sort of development program then the government has been -- that changes kind of the risk equation, take Ford for instance there was a lot of new technology put in on the Ford, the government and the company agreed that the best way to take that risk on was through a cost type contract. Typically, our carrier programs a fixed price incentive contracts, the Kennedy for instance is a fixed price incentive contract. But being the lead ship with all of the risk that goes with that, the company and the government felt like the most efficient way to do that and the most effective way to do that was in a cost type of contract. So risk discussion and development is something that we do all the time with the government and we have very rich discussion about that, but we usually end up coming to some kind of an agreement.
Kristine Liwag: Great. And the follow-up question, if I may and my follow-up is on LPD program. For my understanding in 2016, you have essentially an overlap of two LPDs with the 27 and 28, but then it just drops off to just the 28 after 2017. So I was wondering how should we think about the margin progression of that program as it goes through 2016 and 2017.
Michael Petters: Yeah, that’s right we delivered LPD-26 this year and deliver LPD-27 next year. We don’t have to provide margin rates by program specifically, but we think on a long-term basis our ship building business will be at a 9 plus percent.
Christopher D. Kastner: And what you are talking about on the LPD program happens to us on lots of programs all the time as we wind down one program and start-up other programs. And so, that’s why we try and not to -- we just don’t break it out by program, we are much more blended, it’s the blending of the margins that mattes.
Kristine Liwag: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning.
Michael Petters: Good morning.
Christopher D. Kastner: Good morning.
George Shapiro: Two questions, one on EACs they were as you said Mike $69 million this quarter, I mean that’s very high for the first quarter. I mean last year the first quarter was $55 million and before that it was lower. Is this timing or are we now going to see a higher level throughout the year?
Christopher D. Kastner: George, this is Chris. It’s really related to hitting some major programmatic milestones primarily on the LDP program. So it’s not really a quarter-to-quarter thing when does the program reach these major milestones when they can assess their EACs and potentially retire some risk. So it was really programmatic and it will remain lumpy as you move through the year.
George Shapiro: Okay. Because like last year your average may be for the year more like $60 million a quarter, so this quarter just probably above average then?
Christopher D. Kastner: Not sure at this point, you have to move through the year and move through the delivery cycles for the ships and will assess the risk when we get to those major program milestones.
George Shapiro: Okay. And Mike can you provide some color for sales for the year I mean you’ve been saying that business will be kind of flattish. But even if I take out the $100 million as a one-time benefit to New Port News the sales were still up 6% in the Florida. We’re still looking for flattish or it’s going to be higher this year?
Michael Petters: Everything is lumpy George and I would just say that it doesn’t change might view of the business. This is a pretty flat business that’s going to operate in the 9% to 10% range.
George Shapiro: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Gautam Khanna: Yes forgive me I’m juggling taking current calls.
Michael Petters: Sure.
Gautam Khanna: So just on the Kennedy if you could about some of the major programmatic milestones, we should be monitoring and what are kind of big risk items that we look through the year and perhaps next year. I think quite a potential EAP catch-up or -- I’ll leave it to you to explain it.
Michael Petters: It’s essentially the major programmatic milestones in the lifecycle of a ship when risk can be retired. So you can look at builders trails, you can look at launch, obviously delivery so it’s essential or the important programmatic milestones in a lifecycle of a ship.
Christopher D. Kastner: And over the next couple of years on the Kennedy you’re going not see too many of those really big high visibility kinds of milestones inside of our risk registers. We look at where should we be when we take that unit into the drydock in terms of how complete is it, we complete that we wanted to be, how much work did we differ to the dry dock, how much work did we complete in advance of it going into the drydock. We build these big units out in an area we called the platen area. One thing that I’m really excited about Kennedy is that the units that when we build them in the platen area. But then we take them through the drydock. Ford was good, because we had more complete units on Ford going into the drydock than we have had on previous carriers. But even in the case of Ford, we were still had material issues and qualification of vendors and things like that that typically go on with the lead ship. We’ve got most of that behind us at this point and so the units that are going into the dock on Kennedy today are even more complete than they were on Ford when Ford went in. And we need that to happen to drive the performance the way we wanted to go. And that’s why you see that even with the big learning curve in labor that we’ve taken to drive efficiency on Kennedy. We’re achieving that right now because we’re getting that kind of completion on these kinds of milestones. They’re not terribly visible they’re not going to be anything that you can track really. Because we don’t have a press conference every time we take a unit into the drydock. But it is -- we’re very encouraged by the way it’s going right now.
Gautam Khanna: But I guess to sum up, you don’t view this year as a big [indiscernible] there is not a lot of these risk retirement milestones.
Michael Petters: It’s early in the Kennedy program and the Kennedy is going to delivering ‘21 or ‘22 I guess. So our classic approach is to not take credit for risk retirement until we actually retire it. Taking units to the drydock is great, but you got to get through the ship launch, you got to get through the test program there is a whole lot of stuff to work through over the next six or seven years out there for Kennedy.
Gautam Khanna: Okay, I appreciate that. And maybe you’ve covered this, but if you haven’t any comments on where icebreaker stands?
Michael Petters: The Coast Guard is talking about an icebreaker program. We’re very interested in that program. And have been working to understand more what their requirements are. And as we move down that path it’s kind on the very front end of the program at this point. The Coast Guard is talking to the industry about what’s the art of the possible. And we’re engaging in that conversation and we’ll see how that plays out and when it becomes a real program.
Gautam Khanna: Thank you very much, guys.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn: Mike just while we are on the discussion of the carriers. One of the things we had heard was that on Ford there is a I don’t know maybe the numbers aren’t up-to-date but a couple of hundred rooms that are undone or incomplete. And understandings it’s a lead ship and these things take time. How does that factor in for the company in terms of finishing that work. Is that your work, does that belong to other contractors does that extend revenue to a certain point and then are there any cost per divisions that we might need to think about.
Michael Petters: Rob frankly this is the normal kind of pass through delivery for an aircraft carrier. I think you’re talking a city of 5,000 people with its -- complete with its own airport that actually travels around the people at high speed. And so when the ship delivered there is a discussion between the company and the Navy about what are the things that you know enough to do right now there is some things that you won't finish now because the technology is not available to uncertain that space. And so you’ll reserve instead of building the space so you can tear it apart and put something new in it, you just reserve the space until the system or whatever it is the Navy wants to put in there is available. So this goes on in every carrier delivery to figure out exactly what the delivery condition will be and then how does it get moved ahead in terms of get work done do other contractors come in and get to do some of that work it depends on the system. I don’t know exactly really what to say about that except that if you think about the amount of technology -- how fast technology changes. The design and build the detailed design and construction contract for the Ford was signed in 2008. So there is bound to be things that we have not thought about in 2008 that need to be done on the ship before it deploys. And so working with the Navy to make sure we do that as efficiently as possible as part of the normal process.
Robert Spingarn: But to the extent that that work is yours is that like 9% margin work as it comes in or 8% or is it potentially a source of a drag like what we...
Michael Petters: What I would tell you is you won’t see it. It’s in the thickness of a pencil in terms of our overall results.
Robert Spingarn: So it’s minutia from a relevant perspective. Got it, okay thanks.
Operator: At this time I’m showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Petters for closing remarks.
Michael Petters: Well thank everybody for their interest today. We’re very proud of the work that we’ve done this quarter we’re very proud of the work we’ve done for the last five years. And I think you've gotten a chance now to see in some detail how the blending of mature programs and new programs come together to keep a healthy business in the 9% to 10% range. We look forward to working with you guys over the rest of this year and we hope you all have good day. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the program you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-02-18 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries fourth quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Ranya. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barb Niland, Corporate Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Kastner, Corporate Vice President and General Manager of Corporate Development. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in their remarks today, Mike and Barb will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including certain segment and adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning we released fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results that reflect solid operating margin performance and cash generation at Ingalls and Newport News, while our UniversalPegasus operations continue to be negatively impacted by extremely unfavorable market conditions. 2015 was a year of inflection, marking achievement of our goal of 9%-plus operating margin in the ship building business and the end of the first five years of operations since spin-off. I want to thank each one of the 36,000 employees of Huntington Ingalls for their hard work and dedication that produce these results and for their continuous commitment to safety, quality, cost and schedule. Now, during the quarter we had two events that reduced our GAAP earnings. First, we absorbed the $40 million one-time cost to refinance our 10-year notes, which will significantly reduce our interest cost going forward. Second, we recorded a $16 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and a $27 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge in our other segment. The impairments were driven by continued low crude oil prices and a deterioration of market fundamentals in the oil and gas services industry. Note this fourth quarter 2014 results included similar impacts of $37 million to refinance our seven-year notes and a $47 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. 2015 full year results also included cost from early payment of our term loan in the third quarter and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in our other segment, and favorable resolution of an insurance litigation matter in Ingalls in the second quarter. All comparative data that I discussed today are adjusted for these items as well as the FAS/CAS adjustment. So for the quarter, sales of $1.9 billion were consistent with last year and segment operating margin was 8.8%, down from 9.4% last year. For the full year, sales of $7 billion were 1% higher than 2014 and segment operating margin of 9% was consistent with 2014. Diluted EPS was $1.95 for the quarter compared to $2.19 last year, and diluted EPS for the full year was $7.33, up from $7.14 last year. Additionally, we received $700 million in new contract awards during the quarter, resulting in backlog of $22 billion at the end of the year, of which $11 billion is funded. Cash generation was particularly strong, again, in the fourth quarter with $309 million of free cash flow, which was down slightly from last year, and we ended the year with approximately $900 million of cash on the balance sheet. Since our third quarter earnings call in November, the fiscal year 2016 budget has been authorized and appropriated, and the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request has been released. Within the 2016 budget, I want to point out a few highlights. The final portion of funding was authorized and appropriated to support construction of the 12th LPD, LPD 28, and accelerate by two years construction of the next-generation amphibious warship LXR that will be based upon the LPD. Funding was also authorized and appropriated for a ninth National Security Cutter. All of these actions are reflective of the broad support for the capabilities that these ships provide and our ability to execute within the cost and schedule expectations of our customers. The President's fiscal year 2017 budget request marks the beginning of the process for Congress to consider shipbuilding priorities and investment for the next fiscal year. We were very pleased to see that the President requested funding for all key shipbuilding programs of record, including advanced procurement for the Ohio-class Replacement Program, continuation of CVN-79 Kennedy and advanced procurement for CVN-80 Enterprise, which is the third Ford-class aircraft carrier. The President also requested investment for the refueling overhaul of CVN-73 George Washington and advanced procurement for the refueling overhaul of CVN-74 John C. Stennis; as well as two Virginia-class submarines; two DDG-51 class destroyer; LHA-8, which is the next big deck amphibious warship; and T-AOX, the next generation fleet oiler. We were also pleased to see substantial investment requested for a new Coast Guard icebreaker. We look forward to Congress considering all of these requests over the next several months. Now, I'll provide a few points of interest on our business segments. At Ingalls, the LPD and NSC programs continue to perform very well and are reaping the benefits of serial production, while the DDG and LHA programs remain on track. We expect contract awards for LPD 28 and NSC-9 later this year, and we look forward to continuing our outstanding track record of performance on these very important programs. At Newport News, CVN-78 Ford achieved the milestone, recognizing installation of over 14 million feet of electrical and fiber optic cable in January. This team is working through the test program and preparations for builder's trials in the second quarter with delivery to follow. The Virginia-class submarine program continues to perform at a high level, while CVN-72 Lincoln and CVN-65 Enterprise continue on their paths to redelivery to the customer, expected at the end of this year and in the first half of next year, respectively. As I mentioned earlier, UniversalPegasus recognized non-cash goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges in the quarter. As you know, this is a tough time for the oil and gas industry, but we are continuing to take specific actions to right-size our operations for this dynamic environment to position UPI for long-term success when the market turns. So in closing, I want to recap some of the accomplishments by our team in 2015. We delivered NSC-5 James at Ingalls and SSN-785 John Warner at Newport News. Ingalls and Newport News generated segment operating margin above 9% for the second year in a row, operating and free cash flow were the highest since the spin-off in 2011 and we were awarded $8 billion in new contracts including detail design and construction for CVN-79 John F. Kennedy and construction of NSC-8 Midget. Looking ahead, we laid out the path to 2020 at our first Investor Day this past November. The path includes investing $1.5 billion in capital to strengthen and protect our core shipbuilding business, returning substantially all of our free cash flow to shareholders via dividend increases of at least 10% annually and share repurchases, and leveraging our deep technical services competencies and nuclear operations expertise to optimize and expand our services portfolio. I am excited about the possibilities these strategic initiatives provide for our employees, our customers and our shareholders, as we continue to create long-term sustainable value. And I am confident that we have the right team in place to provide the leadership and focus necessary to execute these initiatives. Now, I have one other important duty to perform as part of this call, that is formally recognizing Barb's contribution to Huntington Ingalls, as she leaves us for retirement. Barb has been a full partner in all that we have accomplished, and someone I have had the pleasure of working directly with for the past 12 years. Her professionalism and pragmatism have been at the heart of our planning and execution. And while we have great confidence in Chris, we will definitely miss Barb. So that concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barbara Niland: Thanks, Mike, for the kind words. It's been a privilege working for you and representing the 36,000 employees of Huntington Ingalls Industries, so good morning everyone on the call. Today I am going to review our consolidated and segment results for the fourth quarter and full year. Then I will hand the call over to Chris Kastner, who will be taking the reign as the new CFO on March 1, to wrap up with some information on 2016. As Mike mentioned, all the numbers that I discuss today will be adjusted for the insurance litigation settlement, the non-cash goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges and the one-time expenses related to early extinguishment of debt. Please refer to the presentation on our website or the earnings release from this morning for more information and the detailed reconciliation. Turning to the consolidated results on Slide 4 and 5 of the presentation, and starting with the quarter, total revenues of $1.9 billion decreased 1.1% from the same period last year due to lower volumes at UPI and Ingalls, partially offset by higher volumes at Newport News. Segment operating income of $167 million decreased $14 million from the fourth quarter 2014 and segment operating margin of 8.8% decreased 63 basis points due to lower risk retirement at Ingalls and lower performance at UPI. Total operating income of $187 million decreased $4 million from the fourth quarter 2014 and total operating margin of 9.8% was down 10 basis points, as favorable FAS/CAS adjustment was offset by the lower segment margin at Ingalls and UPI. For the full year revenue increased 1.1% to just over $7 billion, driven by higher volumes at Newport News. Segment operating income of $633 million and segment operating margin of 9% were in line with 2014, as improved performance at Ingalls and Newport News was offset by the continued pressure at UPI. Total operating income of $735 million increased $33 million, primarily due to favorable FAS/CAS adjustment. Total operating margin was 10.5%. Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operations was $411 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $309 million. For the full year, cash from operations increased $112 million to $828 million and free cash flow of $640 million increased $80 million over 2014. The increase was primarily due to the after-tax effect of the insurance litigation settlement in the second quarter and lower pension contribution. Capital expenditures in the quarter increased $28 million to $102 million from the same period last year. And for the full year capital expenditures increased $23 million to $188 million from 2014. Cash contributions to our pension and post-retirement benefits plans were $136 million in the year, of which $99 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans. Asset returns for the year was a negative 1% and pension discount rates increased almost 40 basis points to 4.73% at the end of the year. During the quarter we repurchased over 332,000 shares at a cost of $38 million, bringing the total number of shares repurchased in the year to over 1.9 million and at a cost of $234 million. In addition, we paid dividends in the quarter of $0.50 per share or $24 million, bringing the total dividend paid for the year to $81 million. Interest expense in the quarter was $64 million and $137 million for the full year and included $40 million and $44 million, respectively, of one-time expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt. This compares to interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2014 of $66 million and $149 million for the full year, which also included $37 million of one-time expense for the early extinguishment of debt in both the quarter and the full year. Our effective income tax rate in the quarter was 37.5% compared to 34.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily driven by lower domestic manufacturing deductions year-over-year. For the full year, the tax rate was 36.1% compared to 33.3% in 2014. The year-over-year increase was driven by the lower domestic manufacturing deductions and higher portions of goodwill impairment that were not amortizable for tax purposes. Moving on to segment results, and starting with Ingalls on Slide 6 and 7, revenues at Ingalls of $580 million in the quarter declined 4.6% from fourth quarter 2014 due to the deliveries of NSC-4 and NSC-5 and lower volumes on LPD 26. The decline in revenues was partially offset by higher volumes on the DDG program. Operating margin of 10.2% in the quarter decreased 167 basis points from the fourth quarter 2014, driven by lower risk retirement on the LPD program. For the full year, Ingalls generated revenues of $2.2 billion, which decreased 4.3% from 2014. Operating margin of 11% for the year increased 102 basis points from 2014, driven by higher performance on both the LHA-6 America-class and NSC programs as well as the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes. Turning to Slide 8. Revenues at Newport News of approximately $1.3 billion in the quarter increased 2.6% from the fourth quarter 2014, due to increased volumes on the VCS program and in-fleet support services. Operating margin in the quarter of 9.3% was in line with the fourth quarter 2014. And for the full year, Newport News revenues of $4.7 billion increased 3.6% and operating margin of 9% was similar to 2014. Turning to the other segment on Slides 9 and 10. UPI generated an operating loss of $12 million on revenues of $29 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $7 million on revenues of $56 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decreases were driven by the prolonged decline in oil and gas services and the effect of restructuring cost during the quarter. For the full year, UPI generated an operating loss of $32 million on revenues of $134 million. Overall, it was another good quarter and good year. As Mike said earlier, we are proud of what our employees have accomplished since the spin. That wraps up my remarks for the quarter and the full year. I will now turn the call over to Chris Kastner to provide you with some information on 2016. Chris?
Christopher Kastner: Thanks, Barb, and good morning. Turning to Slides 11 and 12, and starting with the income statement. For the full year we expect revenues to be relatively similar to 2015. Segment operating margin in our shipbuilding business to be in the 9%-plus range. As a reminder, there can be variation in margins between the quarters, but for the full year we expect to achieve a 9%-plus margin. We are expecting a favorable net FAS/CAS adjustment of $137 million for the year and we expect deferred state income tax expense to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. We expect the interest expense of approximately $75 million for the year and the income tax rate to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Now, a couple of items that will impact cash flow. We plan to contribute $210 million in cash to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans, of which $167 million is discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan. We also expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% of revenues for the year. That concludes my remarks on 2016. I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Chris. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Ranya, I'll turn it back over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen.
Gautam Khanna: Gautam Khanna, Cowen. So guys, I was wondering if you could elaborate on the budget comments, the budget request comments you made in the opening remarks. With respect to the icebreaker, can you give us a sense for how that might be procured and when that might actually be awarded? Also, any color on the LXR program? And maybe some updated milestones on the Ohio-class?
Michael Petters: So we'll start with the LXR program, because I think that's kind of centerline of good news here. The Navy in their budget request they've identified LXR as a program that stays inside the fit-up, and they've actually -- I think they've got it set for the first ship procurement in 2020 I think. But the main thing there is last year we went through a decision process, the Navy made a critical decision to say that the LXR program is going to be based on the LPD haul. And then last year we had the first round of funding for LPD 28. We've now gone through and completely funded LPD 28, which is sort of a transition, if you will, from the production run of LPDs on a path to the LXR. So from my standpoint this is all really good news, because we have a very efficient path to keep the amphibs moving. I've said for five years now that the amphibs are in the scrum, really when it comes to some of this funding. And I think the Navy and the Marine Corp have shown their commitment to the program and we're excited about that, and when it shows up in the President's request, that's a further validation of the importance of the program. It's consistent with the Navy's plans for making it proceed in an efficient way, and it aligns with the way that we're thinking about the business in terms of that production line. So we're excited about that. We have the opportunity to really capture the efficiencies of serial production, which we've been trying to do across all of our programs. On the Ohio Replacement Program, I've been pretty vocal about, we've got the find a separate source of money, we got to find more money for the shipbuilding budget to handle the Ohio Replacement Program, because it could and it's big enough, so that it would crowd out other shipbuilding. I think this is going to be a discussion that we're going to have for the next five to 10 years, really, is how we're going to pay for the program and how comfortable can we do it inside of the Navy's budget. But this first-go round is a great indication that it's going to happen, that it's going to happen and that the other programs are going to stay on track. And so we are very pleased with the way that came out. Now, there's a lot of discussion about different kinds of mechanisms to fund this and from our standpoint we're somewhat agnostic about whatever the mechanism is. What we really need to see is that the funding is there without affecting other programs, and that's what happens in this budget and that's what looks like is happening in the Navy's plan by and large. With regard to the icebreaker, we're on the front-end of that program. We're still at the point of our customers that are out there, trying to set their requirements. And setting their requirements and setting the pace for the program are things that are always kind of influx right now. It's clear there is a commitment to the program. It's a program that we're very interested in and we've been in dialogue to understand what those requirements are and to position ourselves to be able to participate in that program and support the Coast Guard's plans when they go forward. So all of that is good news for us.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.
Pete Skibitski: A couple of questions, I guess. On the pension, contributing the pretty large discretionary amount, can you help walk us through the calculus on that? You talked about returning most of free cash flow to shareholders, where you're making the decision to make a pretty large discretionary contribution to the plan. What led you to kind of down that path to putting that kind of money into the plan?
Christopher Kastner: Our practice is to fund 90% of our plans on a pre-met basis. And in order to maximize our cash recovery across our multiple plans calls for that contribution. So simply maximizing our cash recovery.
Pete Skibitski: And then just one more, I guess. You're excluding the impairments at UPI, I guess, the ongoing operating loss is kind of sharp still. How you guys think about 2016? Do you feel like that business is sized right until it's breakeven in 2016 or is that kind of a quarter-by-quarter issue that you have to manage?
Michael Petters: Yes, it's going to be quarter-by-quarter. I mean the dynamics in that marketplace have been pretty volatile just in the past 30 days. And our commitment here is to maintain the relationships we have with those critical customers out there that are in that space. And that means that we've got to preserve capabilities that those customers are going to need. We are winning our share of the work that is out there, but it's not going to be worked, it's going to kick-in until the end of this year or next year. And so the time facing of that is something that we just got to fight our way through quarter-by-quarter. I wish it were different, I wish it were a different way, but our commitment here is to those customer relationships and we're going to do what we have to do to make sure we get that right.
Barbara Niland: And Pete, in Q4, slightly over half of the UPI loss adjusted for the PI and the Goodwill was related to restructuring cost associated with leases and severance.
Pete Skibitski: So the ongoing operating loss was kind of in the single-digit millions, is that maybe what should we kind of run out for next year?
Michael Petters: Yes. We think that's about right.
Barbara Niland: There is still pressure in that range.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason Gursky: Barb one last question for you on [ph] Litton on Avondale. Can you just update us on the progress of recovery at Avondale, and given all of the moving parts? And that's being handed over to Chris at this point to just take care of.
Barbara Niland: Yes. So Chris started this now, he's going to go finish it here. But we continue to evaluate opportunities including sale. So we did competitively bid and selected a brokerage service to assist in the potential sale of real estate and other assets, while we continue to pursue restructuring. So we have had a few interested parties, so that continues to move along. In addition to that, we've been in discussions on a regular basis with our customer regarding our proposal and those discussions continue.
Jason Gursky: And so maybe just a couple of quick comments about the pipeline of business that you are bidding on outside of the core shipbuilding business. What kinds of things might we look forward to hear in the next, call it, eight-and-a-half, nine months, 10 months here in calendar '16? What are the key programs that you're out there bidding that we all ought to be paying attention to as to who is going to be the winners and losers, and what that will help us understand about future growth opportunities?
Michael Petters: Sure. We talked in November about both the commercial nuclear space as well as the government services space. And in government services, there is both support of the fleet around the world as well as participating in the Department of Energy areas. So commercial nuc, and let's start with that, we're supporting the project that Southern Company and Westinghouse are constructing down at the Vogtle plant. And so we're proud of the performance that we have there. And our hope is that as that market starts to expand, we have an opportunity to do some more in that space. We're navigating our way through the creation of the design and the regulatory oversight of the NRC to make sure we get all that right. And so we've done great work there so far and we're hoping that can turn that into something bigger than what we've got today. In the Department of Energy space, I think the biggest thing that's on the horizon right now is out of Hanford. But there the Nevada National Security site is coming up, we've made a bid on that and we're partnered with Honeywell and Jacobs. And of course in the DOE space there is always a lot of those things going on and a lot of different teams be informed and moving around. So that's a little bit tricky to try to handicap the timing of some of these things in the way that they get awarded. But we're very happy with the way that SN3 has kind of stepped into that market space now and is creating the alliances we need to be successful in that space. And then supporting the Navy around the world; we're watching and participating as the Navy continues to be on call. Longer deployment cycles are putting pressure on maintenance cycles, and support from both an engineering and planning perspective that our folks at AMSEC are very deeply involved in, and so especially as the Navy continues to be forward deployed, we are forward deployed with them. And today, we have a 100 people supporting the Navy in Japan, for instance, and so we're around the world there doing those kinds of things to support them, and that's really a services as the need comes up kind of business. Our expectation is that the demand for that is going to go up. And so I'm not sure, I can put a specific target out there as in terms of a date on that space or a specific program in that space, but I am a believer that the demand for the Navy is going to drive that market.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.
Doug Harned: First, Secretary Carter in his pre-budget statement, he made some comments about CVN-78 construction and that it was undisciplined, and that there would not be another carrier like that or construction process like that. How do you interpret those remarks? And what implications do they have for the approach to the CVN-79 and future carriers?
Michael Petters: Well, I'm not sure I would use the word undisciplined, but I would say that the next carrier will not be, from a cost and schedule performance perspective, will not be like Ford. Ford was a lead ship. We've talked many times about the challenges that lead ships have. This was a particularly challenging project because of the major insertion of technology into the platform. We basically kept the haul and redesigned everything else in that ship. And so today, what we have is we have ship that's built. The ship is completed. We're in a test program now that's going to drive us through the first half of this year. What we have done though, when you build a lead ship, as we've talked about, that lead ship is it's your first production unit, but it's also your first prototype. That is the prototype, and that's where you -- in prototypes you test out your build plans, your test out your training plans for your employees, you test out the tooling that you have, you test out your supply chain. You're basically testing everything. In the course of that testing, you learn things. And what we have is a very extensive process for capturing those lessons learned and applying them to CVN-79. And Doug, as you know, we signed a contract for CVN-79 in the middle of last year, which frankly reflected, a lot of that learning. Some of that learning is capital that we need to invest to drive the efficiencies. And so that's part of our capital plan going forward is to invest to support that program. But there will be a substantially fewer man hours required to build CVN-79 than what we took on CVN-78. The other thing I would say is that there is a broader discussion going on about capability and capacity, which is really interesting to see part of. In the Navy's parlance, this isn't a light switch where you go from one to the other, it's really -- these things take a long time. If you go back a decade ago, CVN-78 was not the only lead ship program out there. The carrier was a new design program. We, at 10 years ago, we were coming through the first new submarine at Newport News. Texas was our first delivery of a submarine in 10 years. So we were kind of on just at the very beginning of clearing up the lead ship kinds of issues in the submarine program. The LHD program was a new design program. The LHA program was a new design program. The DDG-1000 was a new design program. The LPD program was a new design program. So 10 years ago, the navy was basically redesigning all of the shifts in its fleet. Every one of those programs on the front-end went through the first ship of a class kind of perturbations that you got to work through when your first ship is a -- your first production unit is also your prototype. Ford actually is the biggest of those ships and has taken the longest to come through that. But now if you go and look at the sequence of things that are in the Navy's budget today, the carrier is not a new design ship anymore, the Virginia-class program is a gold standard for serial production and technology insertion into a mature platform. The DDG-51 program has been restarted and we're back into serial production on that program. We are now coming through the -- we're in the second ship of the LHA class. Have come through all of the design challenges that LHA-6 had and LHA-7 is performing fine. The LHA-8 is in the budget. And you can just take down every one of the programs that Navy has today are all mature programs that are basically in serial production. And the most important thing that we have to do is keep that moving. So from my standpoint, the capability versus capacity discussion is the really interesting one, but it's different for the Navy because the horizon is so much further way in ship building than it is in anything else, and that's why I am so happy about where we are with the budget, because it definitely shows the Navy's commitment to preserving these production lines and keeping not just the capacity out there, but the capability out there as well.
Doug Harned: But if I can just follow-up on this from the capital plan, because if I look at capital spending involving CVN-79, CVN-80, and then also you mentioned before that the LXR plan it is being built off of LPD-17, but you also have the T-AO-205 plan, which seems to be building off T-AKE and T-AO-187, so if I look at, you've got investment for CVN-79. The Navy is trying to make both of those two other programs competitive, yet one seems just totally tied to NASSCO and one seems totally tied to Ingalls. How do you think about investment across those programs, it looks hard to compete on T-AO-205, do you invest in that? What does this mean for the CapEx profile over the next year?
Michael Petters: That's a great question, Doug, and pretty insightful. Without commenting on the competition what I would say is that remind you that in our shipyards we build multiple classes of ships and so when we think about putting capital investment in the shipyards, most of the capital investment that we put in is designed for multiple classes of ships and so we're focused on those processes and those things that are going to be common across different classes. It's not uncommon, but it's lesser and it's a lesser investment for us to turn around and say we're going to invest in a facility that can only be used for A platform or A class of ship. And so given that, we step back and we don't look at necessarily -- we are investing and improving the performance in the LPD program and we are investing in those kinds of facilities that would help us to be successful in the T-AO program, should that be our program, but it's not. We're not looking at making a specific investment to chase a specific program at this point. So that's kind of the way we think about it and that's why we talked about this investment over the next five years, this $1.5 billion. This is a generational reset for our businesses and we're going to end up building classes of ships in these capital facilities that are not even on the drawing board right now.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Sam Pearlstein: Mike, I just wanted to follow up. You mentioned the builders' trials for CVN-78 in Q2 and delivery to follow shortly thereafter, does that mean the delivery has slipped out of the first half? And then I am just trying to think about is, is there an impact to P&L, like the Ingalls ships went like a reserve release or anything like that upon delivery?
Michael Petters: Well, on the second issue, it's a cost type contract, and so in terms of reserve release it's going to be pretty insignificant. As far as the schedule goes, I don't even want to put any sort of a stake on the ground in terms of saying this is what we're going to go do. The bottomline is that we're testing the ship, and the ship as I was told 20 years ago when I was doing career construction, the ship will leave when it's ready. We're doing everything we can to get the ship out. We expect that to happen in the middle of the year. There is a sequence from builders' trials to delivery that we go through, and so the team down there is committed to getting it done as quickly as possible. As I said earlier, the ship is complete. We're testing systems now that have been installed, and not only are we testing the systems themselves, kind of, is the system working the way that it was designed to work, we're also testing does it work with the other systems the way its supposed to work too. And as a lead ship, all of this integration is a big challenge for us. And the Navy and the company are working through this with probably the best team in the business to get it done. And so like I said, I don't want to commit to any specific date on the schedule, what I'm going to tell you is it's going to go as quick as we can get it out.
Sam Pearlstein: Thank you. And just a follow up, the employment reductions you had announced last year were effective in February. So I'm just trying to think about how did that affect the P&L for the period expenses in Q1. Is it then recoverable? Just trying to think about how it's going to impact the first quarter?
Barbara Niland: For the last year, the reserve was booked for that and it's all recoverable because it's part of our normal benefits package.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: My questions on trying to get a little more hands on free cash flow for '16, so the way I rough it out, tell me where I maybe wrong, CapEx could be a $100 million higher than what it was in '15. You had the $150 million insurance payment in Q2, which I assume you don't get something like that in '16. And then it looks like the pension payment, maybe is $110 million higher than '15. I don't know whether you made a payment in the fourth quarter or not. So when kind of put all that together and net income after FAS/CAS is probably comparable. I figure that maybe free cash flow is going to turn out to be somewhere around $300 million in '16 versus '15. I was just wondering if that's correct or what might be wrong with it?
Michael Petters: Yes, I think you have all the essential elements there, George. Those are the large drivers. I don't see much moment in working capitals. It's fairly balanced through the year. So I think you have it. We don't provide guidance, of course, and payments could move beyond the quarter and through yearend, which would drive it a bit on some of our larger contracts, but I think you have the essential elements.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi: Mike, I wonder if could just talk about kind of the relative revenue contribution from $78 million and $79 million this year and kind of what your assumptions around the margin impact of that, just on the 9% plus guidance you gave for the year. Just any help with that?
Michael Petters: Yes. We don't break anything out by program and so probably not going to do much to help you with the trade-off between $78 million and $79 million. But our commitment is that our core ship building business, over the year, is going to perform at 9%-plus. As Chris pointed out in his comments, there is going to be some lumpiness there and the Ford in the first half of the year is going to have pressure in it. There is no other way to say it. But across the whole business for the whole year, we're going to be at 9%-plus.
Joseph DeNardi: And then just on the M&A side, I think we've talked quite a bit about this at the Investor Day, but what are you seeing there? Are you guys active in kind of looking at other assets to build out the other segment or is it just kind of wait and see approach at that time?
Michael Petters: Well, we won't comment specifically about any particular opportunity. We've got our radar up and we're looking around, the question is how do you value anything and how does it fit in with the strategic view of the organization? As I again, have said from time to time, the first question we ask ourselves is that why would we be a better owner of that business? I mean you got to get through that before you can do anything else. We laid out at the Investor's conference, we laid out some very specific filters that, or hurdles, if you will, that you have to get over for any transactions. And we're insistent that we're going to stick to that.
Operator: And our next line comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi from UBS.
Darryl Genovesi: I guess, similar question to George upon accrual basis. Mike, I know you don't like to give a lot of forward guidance, but maybe perhaps expansion broadly speaking, do you think you guys could grow earnings this year?
Michael Petters: I'm sorry, do I think what -- to grow earnings?
Darryl Genovesi: You think you can grow earnings expansion?
Michael Petters: Yes, I mean, I think the challenges that our core ship building business is right now, even though, there is good things in the budget, the things that are in the budget don't manifest themselves for a few years on our program. And I think we've said for five years that the best way to think about the core ship building business that we have is that it's flat. And so I think that if you want to do the math, our commitment to buyback shares and those kinds of things are out there. But our basic business is a flat ship building business with an opportunity to do some things on the services side from time-to-time. And the earnings are going to be 9%-plus.
Darryl Genovesi: And then maybe just on, one more on the kind of competitive situation. I mean, in your opinion does the decision to use a LPD haul form on LXR still leave an opportunity for sort of a meaningful competitive bidding process? And I guess, similar question on SSBN-X with having kind of gotten into the meat of the next budget cycle now, has there been any clarity offered by the Navy on what your role versus GDs might be on that program?
Michael Petters: Well, I'll let you to talk to the Navy about what there acquisition strategy for LXR might be. I do think that we are in a place in ship building where there is really a lot more allocation than there is competition, and in some cases competition actually slows down the process and/or stifles the innovation somewhat. So I think you have to kind of think our way through that a little bit. I don't exactly know how LXR will come out. We do think the decisions that have been made on LXR so far have been very smart decisions on the part of the Navy to take advantage of all the challenges that we had to fight our way through a decade ago to get these programs up to where they are today. And I think it's a really key decision not to go and start over with a clean sheet of paper and redesign that ship, and so all of those are really good. I want to make sure that I catch -- I think I might have said that LXR was a 2020 program, but I think it's really a 2021 program. And so whatever it is, it's inside the fit up and that's the most important thing is that it's not one of those bowriders that sits right outside the fit up forever. I mean it's actually in the program and the Navy is moving forward on it. So we're excited about that. If the Navy chooses to compete we'll compete. If the Navy chooses another path, we'll partner into that path and we'll go execute it, so more to come, I guess.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kristine Liwag: It's actually Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron. Can you guys discuss how much is lost in Goodwill and intangible assets related to your oil and gas business? And also what are the trigger points for possibly more impairments and write downs?
Barbara Niland: So for UPI, the Goodwill balance is around $29 million and the purchase intangible balance is around $4 million. At the end of the year, when oil prices continue to drop, we went back and triggered another look at our forecast. And when we look at our forecast, we decided that, hey, this has been prolonged. And originally we thought we were going to see a recovery sooner, so we look at it with a more delayed recovery. I'm not saying it can't happen, it's possible. If oil prices continue to drop, we could have a problem. But right now, I think we're in a fairly reasonable place on as far as Goodwill and purchase intangibles.
Kristine Liwag: And switching gears, it seems like the Navy study on potential alternatives to the CVN-78 class is back on the table and with possibly smaller carriers in the long-term. Can you discuss what this would mean for you?
Michael Petters: Well, I think first of all, let's talk about the analysis of alternatives. And one thing that I think it's really important for folks -- and the Navy is going to go off and do their study, and I don't know how that's all going to turn out. However, the Navy works their way through that, we see ourselves as their principal partner in shipbuilding and we will be there to help them do whatever it is that they believe that they need to go do. Now having said that, one of the things that gets lost when you do all of these alternatives and you do this analysis is that there is a lot of metrics that get thrown around like cost per ton and things like that to try to drive more affordable solutions to a mission set. The thing that people don't get sometimes is that the cheapest thing we do is create volume. Building volume in the ship is what actually creates -- that's the cheapest thing we do, so making it large actually suddenly creates a whole lot of flexibility in the platform that you didn't have before. I'm not the metric guy, but I don't believe you can buy two-thirds of a carrier for two-thirds of a cost, two-thirds of the capability for two-thirds of a cost, I don't believe you can do that. Because the first thing you do is you start to reduce the volume, you significantly change the flexibility and the capability of the ship. And so this has been looked at many, many times. Every time it gets looked at it that we come back to this decision that we really do need the volume at sea, so we have the flexibility to go do those missions that we don't even know about right now, that we're going to need to perform for 50 years. So I'm a strong advocate for the big deck carrier. And now having said that, if the Navy chooses to go in a different path then we'll be right there and we'll help them be successful in that path.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Roman Schweizer from Guggenheim.
Roman Schweizer: And, Barb, fair winds and following seas, wish you the best.
Barbara Niland: Thank you.
Roman Schweizer: So my first question just regarding Newport News, I was wondering if there was any opportunity or discussions with the Navy to pull forward possibly any work on CVN-73 or any other projects there to kind of help smooth that workload out in '16.
Michael Petters: There have been a lot of discussion with the Navy on how do we manage this workload valley challenge. But the real challenge that we have is that we have these three carriers to deliver now, starting in a middle of the year and carrying over to the first part of next year. And you can do a lot of things and you can move a lot of work around, and the Navy's work with us to do that. But having said all that, we still have -- this is pretty disruptive. And so we've got to fight our way through it. The most discouraging thing about this, and I'm sure the Navy's is just discouraged about it as we are, is that on the backend of this we're going to start hiring back. Two years from now we're going to be coming right back up towards the levels where we were before we started laying people off. And the Navy works with us very closely to try to prevent those kinds of situations from happening. But this happened because of the sequester environment in Washington and the disruptions that created in long-term planning. And until we get out of that environment, we're all just doing the best we can to fight through it and preserve our skills to the best of our ability. It's no way for the greatest country on earth to run its business. And we've got to do better than that.
Roman Schweizer: And just one more follow-up related to Newport News, but on the submarine side, you sort of talked about the impact of Ohio-class and Virginia-class, really the submarine industrial base and how that workload is sort of spread and shared as those two programs go simultaneously? The Navy's fit up will cut Virginia-class in 2021, the ramp would drop till one per year. And I was just wondering, when you look at that total workload available, would one Ohio-class and one Virginia-class still be sort of net additive to that industrial base?
Michael Petters: Well, I think that you need to recognize that the Ohio-class submarine is a significantly different larger volume of work than a Virginia-class submarine, and so it might be one and one equals two, but one Ohio-class plus one-Virginia class is a significantly higher level of work for the industrial base than two Virginia-class submarines. And the other thing I would point out is that you're looking at the appropriations documents, the real question in the business is not what happens in the years when the money gets funded, what you have to work your way through is what's happening in the business as the ships get build, what do the volumes look like, what do the delivery teams look like and how do those line up. So your really 2021 is only a forecast of where you might be in '26 or '27 or '25 even, so that's kind of complexity of the challenge, but I think, it's easily, it's not even close, one Ohio-class plus one Virginia-class is significantly more work than two Virginia class.
Operator: And we do have a follow up question from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Oh yes, I just wanted to pursue, maybe Barbara and Chris, what the adjustments were in Ingalls, where you said there was lower risk retirements. Could you just quantify what they were because we probably won't get to see them same until the K comes out?
Barbara Niland: Right, well, for the quarter, we had $71 million favorable risk retirement and that was primarily related to the Virginia-class, and across the program. And in 2014 of fourth quarter, we had a lot of risk retirement related to the LPD programs that we didn't have in 2015 in this quarter. So we had $51 million in the quarter of net favorable adjustments, so none of the downers were individually significant, the uppers were primarily related to Virginia-class programs. End of Q&A
Michael Petters: Well, I think that's it on our call list, so we'll wrap up here. I would like to thank everybody for joining us today. And I, again, would like to thank, Barb, I believe this is our 20th call together, so thank you for that, for all of your support and hard work over all these years. We had a great year in 2015. That captures and culminates nearly five years of really hard work by our team. So we'll celebrate that a little bit, but we know that we're not ever done. We have mapped out our strategy for the next five years, so that in essence positions our company for the next 25 to 35 years. In order for those plans to become reality, our focus on program execution, risk retirement and cash generation will not change. So thanks for your interest in HII and we look forward to seeing you soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may now all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-11-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries third quarter 2015 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct at question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dwayne Blake, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Dwayne Blake: Thank you, Amanda. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries' third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer and Barb Niland, Corporate Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in their remarks today, Mike and Barb will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including certain segment and adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, we released third quarter 2015 financial results that reflected solid operational performance. For the quarter, revenues of $1.8 billion were approximately 5% higher than last year and diluted EPS was $2.29, which included one-time cost of $0.06 per share for the full repayment of our term loan. Backlog at the end of the quarter was approximately $23 billion, of which $12.5 billion is funded. Demonstrating continued confidence in the free cash flow generation of the business, our Board of Directors recently approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share and doubling our share repurchase program from $600 million to $1.2 billion. These decisions reaffirm our commitment to continue returning cash to our shareholders. Since our Q2 earnings call in August, Congress passed the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, but the bill was vetoed by the President and returned to the Congress. Last week a budget compromise was reached between the executive and legislative branches which provided temporary relief to sequestration by raising the budget caps in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 for defense and nondefense discretionary accounts. We believe that the budget levels in the agreement paved the way for a corresponding adjustment in defense authorization levels that will ultimately enable enactment of a revised bill. Similarly the budget agreement should allow for final passage and enactment of defense and nondefense appropriations measures. We remain hopeful that authorization and appropriations bills will be enacted in a timely fashion to minimize disruption to the industry. At the same time, our team remains engaged with Navy and congressional leadership on all of our programs. Now I will provide a few points of interest on our business segments. At Ingalls, the NSC program continues to perform extremely well as the team launched NSC-6 Munro in September and is expected to be delivered by the end of next year. In addition, fabrication started in July for guided missile destroyer Delbert D. Black DDG 119, the 32nd Arleigh Burke-class destroyer to be built at Ingalls. At Newport News, the Virginia-class submarine program continues its outstanding performance as the team achieved the pressure haul complete milestone on Washington, SSN-787 in September, signifying that all of the submarine's hull sections have been joined to form a single, watertight unit. Washington will be the U.S. Navy's 14th Virginia-class submarine and the seventh to be delivered by Newport News. On Gerald R. Ford, CVN-78, the overall test program continues to support delivery in the first half of 2016. However, increased vendor service costs required to support troubleshooting and repair of various systems during the test program causes to increase the estimated cost of completion and recognizing negative cumulative adjustment in the quarter. While it is a bit disappointing that we had to recognize a cost increase for the second quarter in a row, we are less than a year from delivery and the Newport News team is focused on completing the work on this first of its class ship in a safe and high-quality manner. And regarding UniversalPegasus, weakness in the oil and gas market remains a challenge. But we are continuing to make difficult decisions to position the business for the market turnaround. In closing, the relentless focus on program execution, risk retirement and cash generation continues to serve us well and remains a top priority. As a result, the team produced solid financial result this quarter that keeps us on track to maintain 9% plus operating margin in our shipbuilding business. Now that concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barb Niland: Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our third quarter consolidated and segment results as well as provide you with a few updates for the full year. Please refer to the slides posted on our website for more information. Turning to the consolidated results on slide four of the presentation. Total revenues in the quarter of $1.8 billion increased $83 million or 4.8% from the same period last year due to increased volumes at Newport News and Ingalls. The increase was partially offset by lower volumes at UPI. Segment operating income of $172 million increased $21 million and segment operating margin of 9.6% improved 76 basis points from the third quarter last year, due to strong performance at Ingalls. Total operating income of $200 million increased $29 million and total operating margin of 11.1% improved 115 basis points from the same period last year due to performance improvement at Ingalls and an increase in the FAS/CAS adjustment. Cash from operations was $254 million and free cash flow was $217 million, which was consistent with the third quarter of 2014. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $37 million compared to $40 million in the same period last year. As I mentioned during last quarter's call, we have been seeing lower than expected capital spending this year. Some of our larger projects started later and slower than planned and so now we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 2.5% for the full year. We will provide you with more details on our capital expenditure expectation during our Investor Day on November 10. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 915,000 shares at a cost of $103 million and paid dividends of $0.40 per share or $19 million. As I mentioned on last quarter call, we repaid our outstanding term loan bringing our third quarter cash balance to $671 million. Moving on to the segment results, beginning on slide five of the presentation. Ingalls' third quarter revenues of $593 million increased $34 million or 6.1% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher volumes on the DDG and LHA programs, partially offset by lower volumes on the LPD and NSC programs. Operating margin for the quarter was 13%, a 315 basis point increase over the same period last year due to performance improvement on the LHA, NSC and LPD programs. Turning to slide six. Newport News third quarter revenues of $1.2 billion increased $80 million or 7.3% over third quarter 2014 due to higher volumes on the VCS program and in-fleet support services. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes on the CVN-72 RCOH and the construction contract for CVN-78. Operating margin for the quarter was 8.5%, a 71 basis point decrease from the third quarter last year due to lower performance on CVN-78. Moving on to the other segments. Revenues in the quarter were $30 million with an operating loss of $5 million due to the prolonged weakness in the oil and gas services market. Now to update you on some items for the full year. We are now estimating a FAS/CAS adjustment of $106 million which is slightly lower than our previous estimates due to updated census data. Additionally, we now expect deferred state income tax expense of approximately $3 million, instead of the $5 million benefit I provided on the first quarter call due to timing of contract income for tax purposes and the impact of the true-up of 2014 estimated taxes to actual filed returns. We still expect interest expense excluding the one-time cost associated with the bond refinance and the term loan repayment to be approximately $95 million. Turning to slide seven, where we have included some sensitivities around 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment. Please remember that pension related numbers are subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria and therefore we will provide you with a better estimate for 2016 on our fourth quarter call. But this chart shows the sensitivities of 2016 estimated cash FAS/CAS adjustment to discount rate assumptions and actual asset returns for 2015 and 7.5% long-term return on assets going forward. At the end of the third quarter, our discount rate was approximately 25 basis points higher than last year and year-to-date actual asset return was negative 3.3%. Therefore, depending on the year-end performance, the measurement criteria and the discount rate, 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment may vary significantly from the sensitivity shown on this chart. But again, we will provide you with an update during our fourth quarter call. To summarize, this was a good quarter, led by strong performance at Ingalls. However, as I often try to remind you that from quarter-to-quarter shipbuilding can be operationally lumpy due to the portfolio mix of the new and established programs, the timing of milestones, risk retirements and deliveries. With that being said, we remain on track to meet our full year 9% plus segment operating goal in our shipbuilding business. That concludes my remarks for the quarter, I will turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Barb. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Amanda, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Gautam Khanna: Thanks. Good morning and great results.
Mike Petters: Thank you.
Barb Niland: Thank you.
Gautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could just comment on, in the defense compromise, the bill that's pending, what you saw that may have been upside or a positive development in the future on anything that was a little bit less positive?
Mike Petters: Well, first of all, I would say, remember the horizon of this business is pretty long-term and so any particular movements in any particular piece of legislation are probably less significant to us, rather than and instead I would say the fact that they have got to a compromise and the fact that they are moving towards a regular order process to get through revise the authorization bill and get these appropriations bills done. We are optimistic that that's going to happen. We believe that the more the legislative process can be in a regular order process, the better chance we have to make the case for the long-term investments that need to be made to support our programs. When we are in a sequestered environment that's a very short term, very narrow focus and it can have some long-term affects. And so we are very, very happy that we have a compromise and we are optimistic that we will get through the appropriations process. But we are paying very close attention to make sure that that happens. In terms of our programs, they are all very well supported, they were very well supported in the first authorization bill and we expect that to continue.
Gautam Khanna: Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up. At Ingalls, obviously you have had terrific results for a while now. And I just want to get sense, I mean is there anything that gives you pause that would potentially slow that down as we move forward in terms of just how the ship flows through? How unusual would you say this quarter was relative to what we could expect going forward?
Mike Petters: Well, we have talked before about these businesses, our balance between work that's happening on mature programs and work that you are starting up on. And we are very, very pleased. I am really proud of the team at Ingalls and what they have accomplished since we have spun the company, but even going further back. They have really rebooted that business to where it is today. But I think the balance between work and retiring risk on mature programs and starting up new programs causes what Barb calls the lumpiness in the business. And that's why we say, the healthiest range for the business is to operate in the 9% to 10% band. Where we are today, as opposed to where we were in 2011, where we had a significant number of mature programs at Ingalls that were performing way below our standards. Where we are today is that our programs that we are executing on, are performing to our standards. The challenge at Ingalls is how do you parlay that into the future work. And the real challenge that we see at Ingalls over the next five years is going to be, what's next. The LPD-28 is an example of, let's keep the production line hot, let's get that program moving, let's bridge the LPD program's success that we have created into the next class of amphibs, let's keep the destroyer program on track, let's keep the NSC program moving. There is talk of an NSC-9 and we are very supportive of that. So the thing that I would say, on the horizon for Ingalls is number one, continue to focus on superior execution, number two, let's go capture that new work that's out there.
Barb Niland: I would also add, for this quarter, we had some favorable adjustment on the LHA-6, which was previously delivered that we cleaned up contract changes and better performance on deferred work. So that also helped increase the Ingalls margin for the quarter.
Gautam Khanna: Got it. Thank you very much, guys.
Barb Niland: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Peter Skibitski: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
Mike Petters: Good morning. Thank you.
Barb Niland: Good morning.
Peter Skibitski: Hi Mike. On this news out there in the quarter that kind of postulated a work ship you guys of, call it roughly 40%, I think on SSBN(NYSE:X). Anyway you would comment on whether or not that's in the ballpark of what you are expecting for the production contract and whether development would be on that order of magnitude as well? Any color you could give around that would be great.
Mike Petters: The short answer is, no, I don't have a comment on that. The broader answer is what we have said before. We are working closely with the other members of the Submarine Industrial Base and the U.S. Navy to try to find the very best way for the nation to produce the Ohio replacement program at the same time that it is producing Virginia-class program. The Submarine Industrial Base has shown that is able to do that in a very, very efficient and effective manner and we are working our way through that now. And so more to come, we will negotiate that and then come back and let you know how it all turned out.
Peter Skibitski: Okay. Great. Just one follow-up. On DoD's decision to do live fire testing on the Ford, is there any financial impact to you guys from that, either positive or negative?
Mike Petters: Not that I would I would hazard to put any sort of programmatic estimate on it, we would probably be involved in trying to set up and also trying to evaluate. But the bigger issue there, I think fundamentally the bigger issue there is, when is the ship going to be ready to deploy. And this is going to change that schedule. And just in the past few days we have we members of the Navy telling Congress that they are short aircraft carriers and so I think that's a bigger issue for the Navy than it is for us.
Peter Skibitski: Okay. Got it. Thanks guys very much.
Barb Niland: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning, Sam.
Sam Pearlstein: Can you talk a little bit about capital? And where I am going with this is, one is what should we think about as the ongoing quarterly interest expense now with the refinancing? And then secondly, given that you have got probably a better than expected rate, why didn't you borrow more buyback stock more aggressively? How are you thinking about capital? Because it seems like you certainly could have borrowed more to do something like that?
Barb Niland: Okay. So I will start with the interest expense. After this year, we will expect to see about $12.8 million savings related to that bond refinancing going forward, so for the year, okay. As far as you asked about capital expenditures or do you just want to talk about --?
Sam Pearlstein: No. Capital allocation. Like why not take advantage of the lower rates and maybe do more in terms of the repurchase? I know that the Board just added the authorization, not capital expenditures, but thinking about the capital of the business.
Barb Niland: So we are going to talk more about that on Tuesday at our Investor Conference. So can we hold that question till then?
Sam Pearlstein: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Barb, could you just go through what you said a moment ago about the puts and takes or EACs, if you will, in the two businesses? You talked about LHA-6, the magnitude of that and any other major positives or negatives at either business?
Barb Niland: Sure. So we had $82 million of gross favorable adjustments and $20 million of gross unfavorable adjustments and net adjustments were $62 million for the quarter. So some of the usual suspects. VCS positive adjustment or favorable adjustment. I talked about LHA-6. NSC programs, some favorable adjustments and on CVN-71, we had some outstanding contract regulations. And on the unfavorable side, it was the CVN-78 and a couple gnits and gnats, none individually significant.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thanks for that. Mike, with CVN-78, it sounds like there are some cleanup items ongoing. Barb just mentioned them. How much longer might we expect to see that at this stage, given that you are so close to the end.
Mike Petters: Yes. I mean the ship is essentially built and where we are now is, we are taking all of that as new systems and we are testing the systems, testing each of the systems out but we are also testing the integration of the systems with each other. Significant amount of new technology in the programs, significant amount of software associated with these systems. Some of it is contracts that are furnished that we have been responsible for. Some of it is government furnished that the government has brought the system to us and now we have to integrate it into the ship and test it. This is the romance of our business is that the test program is designed to iron all of the stuff out. It's really hard to predict how these things are going to go. The team is working really hard to work its way through that. The main thing though is that the schedule is holding and we are on track to deliver this ship in the first half of next year. And so from that standpoint, I think that that sort of puts a boundary on the timeframe of the impact of this program to where we are. We are really disappointed that we this has played out the way that it has. But at the same time, we recognize that it's a lead ship and it's still the best lead ship program I have ever been associated with. So from that standpoint, it's still going pretty well.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then just, Barb, a clarification. You talked about the volatility in the margins. We understand that. But the implied fourth quarter for Ingalls is pretty low at that 9% full-year numbers. Anything we should interpret from that?
Barb Niland: Well, I just wanted to remind everybody, the LHA-6, the big adjustment that we made the quarter made the margins pop.
Robert Spingarn: Do we go back to normal? Or do we go back to lower than normal?
Barb Niland: You are killing me.
Robert Spingarn: Not trying to.
Barb Niland: I will get back with, hey, by the end of the year, we will be at 9% plus in our shipbuilding business. How about that?
Robert Spingarn: Okay.
Mike Petters: And I will go back to what we have always talked about. If you try to predict where anyone of these things is going to be in any particular quarter, that's a bunny trail that we really don't recommend you go down. You have to look at the aggregate of the business over a four quarter period and see how that all smoothes itself out. Ingalls is doing really well. There is no doubt about that. That's not to say that Ingalls is going to always have every quarter be like this quarter has been. We are trying to make sure that you understand that there is some one-time things in this quarter that they have earned, but they show up in our accounting this quarter.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Finbar Sheehy: Good morning. It's actually Finbar, here for Doug.
Mike Petters: Hi Finbar. Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning.
Finbar Sheehy: Good morning. A couple of things, sort of short. On Newport News, you announced layoffs earlier in the year because of the phasing and scale of the work coming up. Are you at the right level now? Or done with that? Or where do we stand with that?
Mike Petters: No. This is just the first phase of that. And remember the cause of this that it's because we have three aircraft carrier deliveries in a very narrow window, I think it's now we are down. I think it's about 15 months now we are going to be delivering three carriers. And truthfully some of that was caused by the budget battle back about three years ago when the arrival of the overhaul was delayed due to a congressional dispute. But because we are going to be working through that over the next year-and-a-half, we are going to have another round of this next year that we are going to have to recognize. The saddest part of it all is that, on the other side of this, when we start heavy work into the buildup of the Kennedy workforce and the buildup of the Ohio replacement workforce, we are going to want to hire a lot of the folks back. And that's the problem that we have when we get a little bit out of phase is that, this coming and going is not healthy for the business. And it tears our heart out that we have to go through this sort of thing and we try to move mountains to prevent it. And our legislators try to do that too and it's incredibly unfortunate that we are going to actually have to go through this little dance over the next couple of years.
Finbar Sheehy: And given the pressure on volumes, the presumed either layoff costs associated with that and then rehiring and retraining, are we looking at pressure on the margins there for some time to come from this?
Mike Petters: Well, I think it's fair to say that the blended balanced shipyard operates in the 9% to 10% range. I think all-in-all across the industry, Newport News has a very bright future but they are going to have to work through some pretty tough issues in the next 18 months.
Finbar Sheehy: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mike Petters: Hello.
Barb Niland: Myles?
Mike Petters: Okay. It looks like we lost him. Move onto the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi. Your line is open.
Jason Gursky: Good morning, everyone.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning, Jason.
Jason Gursky: Congrats on the retirement, by the way. Can you just give us a quick update on the Avondale negotiations with the Navy? Expected timing and whether you have gotten any feedback from them on your proposal?
Barb Niland: Yes. We did get a feedback with lot of question cost this past quarter and we are working with them. We have answered all of their questions and we are waiting to hear back from them. So as I said before, this will be a process and it's a continuous negotiation and providing more data to support costs on our proposal. So no real big change other than they gave us some questions. We answered the questions. We are waiting to hear back.
Jason Gursky: And Barbara, are there are statutory timelines on this? Or is this just an open ended negotiation and it is done when it is done?
Barb Niland: Actually we have a statutory requirement at the next year, sometime next year. And so we will either have to extend it or settle it or if we are in total disagreement take a decline. But I am optimistic that we will work together with our customer, have a resolution that meets our expectations.
Jason Gursky: Okay. Great. And then, Mike for you, on the CapEx side of things, we are running a little bit lower than what was expected for this year. What does that say about margin rates over the next couple of years? I know that some of this CapEx was going to go towards things that were going to help improve your cost structure and your ability to perform over the longer-term. There is lack of a ramp in CapEx this year, push out the potential positive impacts of that capital?
Mike Petters: We have not ever really said that this capital was going to improve near-term margins. This is really, I think I have characterize it is a generational investment in our business. And it's really about the long-term support of programs over the next couple of decades. So the time phasing that you are seeing now is really driven by our analysis of the project, where it stands and then how you bring that project into --how do you start that project up in a way that's not terribly disruptive to the work that you have already got going on. And so it's a pretty massive planning job to think your way through. I am building the most complex warships in the world and now I am going to redo the facilities or create new facilities while I continue to build the most complex warships in the world. And so you know we are very thoughtful about that before we cut the money loose to go and invest in a project because once we cut it loose it's too late to go back at that point. So we are doing a lot of analysis. We are doing a lot of study, a lot of planning, a lot of interaction with all our program folks and with our customers to make sure that we keep everything that we have got on track but that we can effectively and efficiently cut in the programs or cut in the projects in a way that they will support programs as best they can. So there is a lot going on here, but I think it's evidence of the thoughtfulness that's going into these investments.
Jason Gursky: That's great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ron Epstein: Hi. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Mike.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning.
Ron Epstein: A big picture question for you. As you think about the future of the business, you guys make one move to diversify into the oil engineering services stuff that didn't really play out. Do you think about other ways to take the business and to diversify some away from just the large shipbuilding or for evermore is the business a shipbuilding business?
Mike Petters: Well, Ron, we are going to talk about this at some length on Tuesday. Let's just say that I still think that there is a lot of capability in our business and there are customers out there that need it. And so trying to find the right business arrangement that allows that kind of access to happen is something that we believe needs to happen. And so like I said, we will talk on Tuesday a lot about who we think those customers are and how we plan to think our way through that. But yes, I still think it's really important for this business to not be so focused in on one single customer and one single approach because frankly there are a lot of people out there that do a lot of great things that we can learn from and we do a lot of great things that they can learn from us. And so that's what's going to, I think ultimately create more value in this business.
Ron Epstein: Okay. Great. And maybe just one follow-on, kind of related. When you look out over the next year or so, what other opportunities are there right now within the core business that you are looking to chat or they are on the horizon?
Mike Petters: Well, if you take a look at this business over the next five or 10 years, the single most important issue in front of the industry, not just us, but the industry is how is the Navy going to pay for the Ohio replacement program. If the money for that program is going to be paid out of the traditional shipbuilding account at the traditional levels, then a lot of other programs are going to be affected. On the other hand, if there is a way for that program to be funded, either outside of shipbuilding account or above the shipbuilding account, then you have a chance for the industry to remain healthy in support of all these programs that the Navy needs. And so you know when I step back, there is probably a lot of things that we have done some technology investment in undersea warfare. We bought an undersea systems group that brought some technology to us and we are interested in those kinds of things. And you can stack all of those programs up. But at the macro level, the most important issue facing the industry today is how is that Ohio replacement program going to be funded. It has to be done. It's a national priority. I am a little biased. I was a boomer sailor myself when I was back in the Navy. But it is something that the nation is going to do. And so the question now is, how do you do that and still do all of the other things that we need to be able to get done.
Ron Epstein: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
Mike Petters: You bet. Thank you.
Barb Niland: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi from UBS. Please go ahead.
Darryl Genovesi: Hi guys. Thanks for the time.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Barb Niland: Good morning.
Darryl Genovesi: Barb, when I look at your presentation slide on page seven, it shows a downward variation of the FAS/CAS income [indiscernible] and the discount rate, I think that's opposite to what we are accustomed to seeing. Can you explain what's going on there?
Barb Niland: Right. Well, what we did on this chart is, we assumed that FAS and CAS move equally so we probably should have footnoted that on there. So when you think about it, when the discount rate goes up, your expense goes down. So well that's the nuance here. We just assumed that FAS and CAS moved equally.
Darryl Genovesi: Okay. And Mike, if I could just ask you a bigger picture question, that admittedly is probably better save it for Tuesday. You have talked a few times about, in fact you have talked very frequently about shipbuilding business is doing 9%, 10% EBIT margins through the cycle. When I compare this with other defense businesses, we have seen margins at other defense primes move up pretty significantly over the course of lifecycle. A lot of them are doing 12%, 13% EBIT margins these days. And I just wondered if there is something that's sort of structurally different about shipbuilding that you think makes it an inherently lower margin business than, say, aircraft or other vehicles or whatever the case maybe.
Mike Petters: That's a really good question. I mean it is sometimes disconcerting to see the challenge for the businesses that are so capital intensive to be in a second tier of margin relative to some of the other programs in the business. But when I step back and think about why that is, I think there is probably two things that don't get a whole lot of attention. One is, a lot of those businesses that are at higher margin, they have actually done some of the same things that we do. They are in serial production of their product. They just have lots of products. And so even in shipbuilding, where we are able to get into serial production in our programs, we are able to drive our margins and drive our investment plans to perform very well. The challenge that this company has, is that a significant part of our businesses doesn't really can allow for serial production. I mean serial production in aircraft carriers is, yes, I mean we optimize that if we could build them three or four years apart, but that's not the way they are being bought right now. And so that creates risk in the program that doesn't exist if you are producing 100 planes or an assembly line kind of operation. So that's one part of it. But the other side of it is that the capital investment that we make in our business has a much longer life, I think than the capital investment that gets made in some of those other businesses. These great companies that build these high-performance platforms for the department, they are inserting technology in their assembly lines and into the product and they are making that investment and they are getting that return because they have multiple products. So they are getting that return pretty fast. For us, we are making a pretty substantial capital investment in our business, it's going to play out over the next 25 years. So there is a pace to this business that's a little bit different. And as a result, I think that you know, our customer is able to go and say here is where I want to go over the next 30 years. 30-year plans change sort of the risk profile of the industry. And so I think all of those things sort of conspire together to create a situation where the healthiest business for us is in the 9% to 10% range. We certainly are going to have quarters where we are above that. And we are going to have quarters where we are below that. But I think that over a 30-year period, if a shipbuilding enterprise operates in the 9% to 10% range, that's a pretty good business.
Darryl Genovesi: That's great color. Thanks a lot.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Just a couple of quick ones. On the Ingalls margin Barb, would it be fair to assume that since the pickup came from primarily LHA-6 and that was one of your last underperforming ships that the likelihood of getting those kinds of pickups in the future is low and that's why you are saying a lot of it's nonrecurring?
Barb Niland: I am not saying it's impossible that in the future you will see a large pickup or a pickup to that extent. But Ingalls, like we have said, is doing very well. All the ships are performing very well. We have a very methodical approach to risk retirement on all of our ships, both at Newport News and at Ingalls. And this just happened to be some contract changes, completing a couple things on LHA-6 that gave us a nice little pop there.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then just to follow-up on the FAS/CAS, most of the other companies imply that the CAS does not move around as much as the FAS does. So is it really maybe just an overly conservative assumption to assume they will both move equally?
Barb Niland: It was a conservative assumption. Really when you think about this, it's not only is at the expense side, but it's really moved the liability side and that's really where you want to see the discount rate go up for us.
Mike Petters: Yes. I would point out, George, that overly was your word, not ours.
George Shapiro: Okay. Again, Mike, when you talk about the 9% to 10% range for shipbuilding and then you talk about the difficulties of Newport over the next year or two. I mean, is it possible. Newport's margin would drop below the 9%, but Ingalls would be enough higher that you are still in the range that you are talking about?
Mike Petters: Well, I think in the macro, that's certainly one possible future for us. Our targets are to keep both of our business in the 9% to 10% range. The challenge at Newport News has right now is that not only do they have those three carrier deliveries, but they are all cost type work. And so that is a little bit just the contract types are off balance for them as to where they normally are. The normal carrier construction business is a price type contract as opposed to a cost type contract. And so there is a little bit of imbalance in contract type at Newport News that they are going to be working through at the same time that they are working through these three contract deliveries. And so that's a little bit, in my experience, that's a bit unusual for them. And that's going to put some pressure on them. We have got a great team there and they are doing what they need to do and we have got some good targets for them. But in the aggregate, I think it's fair. You have got a good point. If you step back and look at the entire shipbuilding business in aggregate, we certainly believe that we are going to be in that range for as far as we can see.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Barb Niland: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Sorry about the technical issues last time. Mike, you talked about the 18-months delivery for the three carriers. And I wonder how much of a proxy of the headcount reductions we should think about as a proxy for the sales headwind that you are anticipating on the back of those leaving the shipyard? And then secondarily, can you size for us or maybe just rough order of magnitude or comments on the Ingalls towards the end of the decade, what kind of revenue profile headwinds there may or may not be that the authorizer seem to be looking to accelerate ships into to avoid?
Mike Petters: Right. So certainly when you are at this point where we are reducing headcount at Newport News, that's going to have some effect on volume at Newport News. But as I pointed out, Newport News, you step back and look at this over a five or a 10 year period as we look at it. In my view, they have the brightest future of any of the businesses in the industry because the demand for the products that they have out there is higher. It's making headlines. And so there is a buildup of demand for the work that Newport News is doing. And it's just that we have got to get through this in phase of this last cycle, the new class of ships, the inactivation and the delay that we saw in the refueling that we have got to work through that turbulence to get to the beginning of that future. And so if you go out over five years, I think Newport News is going to be in great shape. At Ingalls. I think it's a little bit different in that, things are going really great there right now. We have got four different classes of ships under construction in that shipyard. But if you look down the sideline at each of those classes, you start to see that that follow-on programs are where all the risk is going to be. We are at the end of the LPD program, for instance. And so the decision to bridge from the LPD program to the LXR program via LPD-28 is a huge decision for Ingalls. And it does create some stability going forward, assuming the LXR program can be accelerated. And as we talked about before, the LXR program is going to be, I think, tied to what happens with the Ohio replacement program. So these things are all kind of intertwined. The destroyer program at Ingalls, I think, is in reasonably good shape going forward in terms of the outlook for destroyers. The large deck amphibs, we are building the seven today and we will be competing, we are in competition for the eight going forward with the LHA-8 and the TAOX. And so that needs to get settled. But then the question is, what happens after that. And then you are going to see, we are building six. The program of record was for eight. There is talk about ninth one. So that's kind of playing out there. There is discussion of an icebreaker out there that is in there. So Ingalls, it's a little bit harder to pin down where Ingalls is going to be in five or 10 years than it is to pin down Newport News. And a little bit more dynamic environment at Ingalls. And a lot of their success in the future depends on how well they do the work they are doing today. And we are very, very pleased with where we stand.
Myles Walton: One other one, Mike, if I could. The shipbuilding account that you set aside are potentially set aside for the boomer and other items outside of the typical shipbuilding budget. In a scenario, what's the right size for that budget to be kind of on a go forward basis, as you think about it?
Mike Petters: Yes. Well, that's a good question. And I guess I am less concerned about the mechanism for the funding. The legislative branch has created a mechanism for the funding. I think the Department of Defense is thinking about whether that's the right mechanism or if there is another way to do it or do we just bring it back into the shipbuilding account. I think what matters here is that you fund the design and you fund the early lead time procurement, you fund that on time. We have seen over and over and over again, what happens when you get yourself into a place where you need to move into production and the design is not done or the suppliers are not sorted out. And so I think what matters right now is that we keep the funding profile for the design and the early procurement, because that's going to set the stage for early success in that program. And that's going to be ramping up over the next over few years. I mean it's a pretty healthy requirement to keep that program on track.
Myles Walton: Okay. Thank you.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mike Petters for any closing remarks.
Mike Petters: Well, I thank everybody again for joining us on today's call.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct at question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Mitchell. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries' second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer and Barb Niland, Corporate Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in their remarks today, Mike and Barb will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including certain segment and adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, we released second quarter 2015 financial results that reflected solid operational performance by Ingalls and Newport News, while UniversalPegasus continue to be affected by weakness in the oil and gas market. During the quarter, we had two events that affected our GAAP earnings. The first event was a favorable resolution of an insurance litigation matter that resulted in decreased sales and increased operating income at our Ingalls segment and an after tax increase in EPS of $1.80. The second event was a goodwill evaluation that led to a $59 million non-cash impairment charge in our other segment and an after tax decrease in EPS of $0.96. All comparative data that I discuss today are adjusted for these items. For the quarter, sales of $1.76 billion were slightly higher than last year and diluted EPS was $2.36 for the quarter, up from $2.04 last year. Excluding the FAS/CAS adjustment of $0.37 per share, second quarter EPS was $1.99, up from a $1.75, last year. We received $4.5 billion in new contract awards during the quarter, including the detailed design and construction contract for John F. Kennedy CVN 79, resulting in backlog of approximately $24 billion of which $14 billion is funded. Since our Q1 earnings call in May, the house and senate have each past their version of the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, and contraries are anticipated to complete negotiations on a final bill after the August recess. While progress has also been made by the house and senate on appropriations bills, final passage and enactment of these measures is contingent upon an agreement between congress and the administration regarding the balance of spending across defense and non-defense discretionary accounts. This combined with the inability to resolve sequestration could lead to yet another continuing resolution or even worse the government shutdown would be very disruptive to our industry. We remain hopeful that these issues are resolved in a timely fashion and disruption to the industry will be minimized. At the same time, our team remains engaged with the Navy congressional leadership on all of our programs. Now, I will provide a few points of interest on our business segments. At Ingalls, the NSC program continues to perform extremely well as the team delivered NSC-5 James to the Coast Guard in June. In addition, the state of Mississippi executed a bill for $20 million bond that combined with our capital investments will support a new drydock, building improvements and new covered facilities, which enable more work to be accomplished without being affected by the weather. This partnership with the state will help maintain jobs and supplier opportunities in Pascagoula and across Mississippi for years to come. At Newport News, the Virginia-Class Submarine program continued its outstanding performance of the team delivered John Warner SSN-785 to the Navy in June. Two-and-a-half months ahead of the contract schedule. On Gerald R. Ford, CVN-78 testing of the new electromagnetic launching system has gone well and the overall test program continues to support delivery in the first half of 2016. However, based on recent performance trends for this first of a class ship, we recognized an increase to the estimated cost of completion that resulted in a negative cumulative adjustment in the quarter. Regarding UniversalPegasus weakness in the oil and gas market remains a challenge. However, initial phases of work on a few projects from UPI's key customers have recently been turned back on. In spite of these positive developments, it is still difficult to predict when the market will ultimately turnaround. As we finish the second half of 2015, our relentless focus on program execution will remain a top priority. We face many challenges, but we have a great team to work through them and keep us on track to maintain our 9-plus percent operating margin in our shipbuilding business. I am extremely proud of this team and I appreciate all the hard work and sacrifices that they make each and every day. That concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barb Niland: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our second quarter consolidated and segment results as well as provide you with a few updates for the full year. Please refer to the slides posted on our website for more information. As mike mentioned, we settled an insurance litigation matter during the quarter and received $150 million in cash. As a result of the settlement, Ingalls' revenues declined $13 million due to lower overhead costs and its operating income increased $136 million. In addition, we took a $59 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the Other segment; where applicable all the numbers I discussed today will be adjusted for the litigation settlement and the goodwill impairment charge. Turning to the consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation, total revenues of $1.76 billion increased $39 million or 2.3% from the same period last year, due to increased volumes at Newport News and submarines and fleet support service. Segment operating income increased $3 million to $166 million, due to higher volumes at Newport News and performance improvement at Ingalls, partially offset by an operating loss at the others segment. Segment operating margin was 9.4%, which was relatively flat to the second quarter last year. Total operating income increased $11 million to $192 million, primarily due to higher favorable FAS/CAS adjustment year-over-year. Total operating margin was 10.9% compared to 10.5% in the same period last year. Cash from operations was $166 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $137 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $29 million, up $2 million from the second quarter last year. For the full year, we now expect capital expenditures as a percent of revenues to be approximately 4%. The lower than expected is all due to timing and therefore the spend will move in to 2016. You can also expect to see elevated level of capital expenditures over the next two to three years. We will provide you with our estimates for each fiscal year during our fourth quarter call and update you as we go throughout the year. As previously discussed, we had planned to make $99 million discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan this year. In the first quarter, we made a $2 million contribution and during the second quarter, we funded the remaining $97 million balance. Additionally, under our share repurchase program, we purchased approximately 530,000 shares at a cost of $64 million during the quarter and we paid dividends of $0.40 per share or $20 million, bringing our second quarter balance to 960 million. Moving onto the segment results, beginning on Slide 5 of the presentation, Ingalls' second quarter revenues of $559 million decreased $13 million or 2.3% from the same period last year, driven by the delivery of LHA-6 and NSC-4 and lower volumes on the LPD program. Operating margin of 11.1% in the quarter increased 78 basis points over the same period last year due to the risk retirement on DDG and NSC programs. Turning to Slide 6, Newport News second quarter revenues of $1.2 billion increased $37 million or 3.3% over the same period last year, due to higher volume on the VCS program and on aircraft carrier maintenance. This was partially offset by lower volumes on CVN-72 RCOH and the construction contract for CVN-78. Operating margin for the quarter was 9.3% or 14 basis point increase over the second quarter last year due to performance improvement and risk retirement on the VCS program; partially offset by lower performance on CVN-78 an lower volumes on their aircraft carrier RCOH programs. Moving to the Other segment, revenues in the quarter were $35 million with an operating loss of $5 million. Project delays and work scope reductions continue to negatively impact performance. Now, for an update on a couple of the below the line items, on July 13th, we closed an amendment to our bank credit facility and used cash on the balance sheet to replay our outstanding term loan, which was coming due at the end of March 2016. The amendment included an increase in our revolving credit facility to $1.25 billion and $500 million letter of credit sub-facility. Our Form 8-K disclosing the amendment was filed July 15. We now expect interest expense of approximately $95 million for the year. Additionally, since a portion of the goodwill impairment charge is not amortized for tax purposes, we now expect an income tax rate of approximately 35% for the year. To summarize, this was a good quarter with solid performances in our shipbuilding business. As I said before, this business can be operationally lumpy, but we remain confident that we will achieve the 9-plus percent segment operating margin in our shipbuilding business. That concludes my remarks for the quarter. I will turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Barb. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get us many people through the queue as possible. Michelle, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.
Barb Niland: Good morning, Joseph.
Operator: I am sorry. His line just disconnected. We are going to move onto our next questioner, which will be Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: I good morning guys actually Jon Raviv on for Jason.
Mike Petters: Hi, John.
Mike Petters: Hi. Just a question about just shipbuilding margins obviously very strong this quarter, especially in Ingalls. Could you go a little bit deeper into that 11% what is sustainable what is?
Barb Niland: We delivered NSC-5, so we had risk retirement on the NSC programs. All the NSC programs were doing well as well as we had some risk retirement on DDG, so you heard my comment about the lumpiness in our operational performance was timing of risk retirement. As we said before, you now our healthy shipbuilding business runs at about 9% margin, so that is what we expect.
Jon Raviv: Okay. Great. Then just as a follow-up, just thinking about your suggestion that you are confident you will achieve above 9% margin on ships. It seems like year-to-date you are way above that, so is this some lower expectations of those risk retirements or they are actually going to see some ramp up in some that cost-plus stuff in the second half that would pressure margins?
Barb Niland: I do not really like to say lower expectations. It's really just about timing. For example, I had talked a little bit about 78. We did not quite meet our expectations there of retiring the risk we wanted to, so it is really just timing of when those risk retirements occur. I go back to my healthy shipbuilding businesses in a 9-plus percent range of margins.
Jon Raviv: Thanks. I will jump back in the queue.
Barb Niland: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: A little bit of a forward-looking question on the Newport News layoffs. Should we read that as an indicator? Directionally next year, should we think of Newport News being down?
Mike Petters: We have talked before about the Newport News piece of the business being a little bit out of balance with three aircraft carrier deliveries over the next year-and-a-half or so. The signing of the 78 contract is helpful, but it doesn't solve the problem for us and what happens on the other side of that is, we start to ramp back up again but we are going to have to go through a little bit of a reset of the business over the next year-and-a-half to two years.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. On the other side, could you connect that at all to Ingalls? Is there possibility for Ingalls to offset at all?
Mike Petters: The Ingalls business from a business development standpoint is a little bit more dynamic than the Newport News piece. There is certainly a lot in front of Ingalls that I would say is in the go get category, LPD-28 for instance successfully resolving the competition around TAO and LHA. What happens to LXR, you know quite frankly what sits over top of all of this is how is how is ORP going to get paid for? If ORP is going to be paid for outside of the shipbuilding budget then a lot of things in the industrial base worked out really well. If it gets taken out of high then there is going to be a tremendous negative impact to the industrial base especially for non-nuclear ships, so that to us is the big issue is getting ORP funding sorted out.
Barb Niland: Pete, I will follow-up with, we said we will have flat revenues and you are spot on with three carrier deliveries over the next 18 months or so, you will see some pressure on volume at Newport News, but at Ingalls we have, I think, it is 11 ships in construction right now and they are going on full cylinders over the next few years. What Mike was talking about is outside of that window, so there could be some movement between the balances there, but we expect to be in a flat range.
Pete Skibitski: Thanks guys.
Barb Niland: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Yes. Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Doug Harned: I would like to continue on Newport News, because when you look at this transition which is leading to workforce reduction, is this something that is how you would view it as sort of a normal transition as you deliver the Ford next year ramp up on the CVN-79? Is this a normal transition or does this tie into some of the funding issues that we have seen over the past few years in terms of the timing of availability of funds?
Mike Petters: I think it is probably a mix of both, Doug. I mean, there is always a reset of the business when you have a delivery, especially the delivery of the Ford, but it certainly has not helped us. The sequestration debate has delayed the refueling by period of time. The George Washington is supposed to come in, but it is coming in later than we had originally planned, so and that is driven by funding. The discussion about two years ago, there was big discussion on whether it would even be refilled or not. All these funding issues in the political discussion around that has contributed to the imbalance, it is not the sole cause, but it certainly has contributed to that imbalance of deliveries happening without follow-on work being there. We went through a long period here of negotiation on the CVN-79. That was particularly challenging for everyone, because we were all trying to figure out how do you move to a price type contract when you are not all the way through the first ship and how do you manage the risk and how do you budget for the risk and how do you contract for the risk. The solution to that was to delay the contract to, I mean, we are very happy to have it here this year, but delaying that contract, that contributes to some of what is going on here. In a normal case, you would like to actually be able to have folks come off of a program and roll right back into the follow-on program and not miss the beat. Some of these, there is a few various factors there that have contributed to this little bit of imbalance and we have to reset the business looking forward, so that we can minimize the impact of that.
Doug Harned: Then related to this would be the role that you ultimately have on Ohio-class replacement. I mean, right now I know you are doing some work, could you talk about what you are doing today and what you are looking for to clarify the role that you will likely have going forward on that program.
Mike Petters: Well, I think, all I want to say that this is that how we how we participate in the submarine construction for the country is all under discussion at this point, because the submarine industrial base that produces the Virginia-class will still be now called on to produce the Ohio replacement program. When you take a ship that is the size of Ohio and you put it into that base, it is going to have an impact on various parts of the base, so the discussions that we are having between us and our partner and our customer are all about how do we do all of the submarine work as efficiently as possible. Without trying to handicap or predict how all that is going to turn out, I would just say we expect to be fully engaged in the production of submarines for this nation for the foreseeable future.
Doug Harned: Is it fair to say that what you are looking at it is a really a corrective discussion on the future roles on Ohio-class replacement on Virginia-class that this is all being done is one large entity in a sense?
Mike Petters: Yes. I think philosophically that is what we are trying to do. The you know the realities of our preparations in the far drive you into stovepipe sometimes, but even when you are in the stovepipe of a particular program you can still kind of stick your head up and look around and see what is happening across all the programs of similar types. Yes that is what we are doing.
Doug Harned: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Good morning. Barb, the cash flow looked somewhat weak even if I adjust for like the $97 million pension you had and receivables were up not a lot, but up another $25 million despite delivering the NSC-5, so where does that receivables go for the year and maybe you could talk a little bit about, obviously you have a strong cash flow usually in the second half, particular last quarter, maybe talk a little bit about where that goes?
Barb Niland: Yes. Well, I think we are right at the [ph]. We did not have timing of our receivables this quarter was not as good as certainly not as good as December. Really, it is just timing. I talk about that all the time. I do not really expect to see much of a difference. Pick up a little cash as we continue the rest of the year, so I do not see anything out of the norm.
George Shapiro: Okay. One you, Mike, if we look at the impairment charges other now, so you have written off of almost half of the price you paid for this business about a year ago. My question is, if oil prices stay about where they are now, it seems to be the prevailing you. What can we look forward to in that business? Do we lose $5 million at quarter going on or if you can give us some color on that.
Mike Petters: I certainly have proven my inability to forecast this market, so I am probably going to defer whatever happens to the price in the future. What we were set out to do when this market was disrupted was to make sure that we preserve the key capabilities that our customers needed while they sorted through the impact to their capital spending plans for the stuff that we do. I actually think we make made some progress over the last quarter from where we were first quarter and coming through this. What we are watching now as Barb indicated in her notes is that our customers are coming through their thinking on what current market conditions mean to their capital expenditure plans. We are right on the front end of that. We have maintained key capabilities so that we can support that. Our customers are aware of that. They know that we are leaning into this to help them get their way through that. We are going to see how this plays out. I think that we made great progress, but we have not we have not solved the whole problem yet, so that's I think where we are now is probably lines up with how this might go for the rest of the year, but it depends on how the capital projects come forward that we are anticipating.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning, Sam.
Sam Pearlstein: Can I just follow up on the UPI stuff? Was any of the write-down, does that affect any of the ongoing cost on the intangible amortization or is this purely goodwill and there is no benefit to kind of future reported results.
Barb Niland: Yes. I wish there was. It is all goodwill unfortunately, so no impact on the purchase intangible, so that will continue to be a drag.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay. Then just follow up on the capital spending plan. I know you are awaiting some of it was for the Kennedy contract. It did not step up that much from Q1 to Q2. I mean, how quickly can you actually ramp up that spending? I know you said 4% of sales growth for the year, but just in terms of thinking about even next quarter, how much of a step up we start to see?
Barb Niland: Sometimes they can surprise there, how quick they can spend things. It really depends on what the project is, if it is, we have to construct it or is it we are just buying something, so I think it just depends. I would expect that is to ramp up over this quarter and the third quarter. Then we always have higher spend in the fourth quarter capital, so thing to remember though, if do not spend it all this year, I did not release the capital on 79 until we got the contract, so - our delay Ingalls, I have not released all the capital because there they are still doing the proof-of-concept in the engineering studies. As soon as they come through with that, we will release the capital, but what will happen is it is all going to slip. Whenever I do not spend this year will slip into 2016, so we could have some higher capital in 2016, just because we are moving stuff from '15 to '16.
Mike Petters: To put some context on it, this is not just capital, where we are buying new stuff to put in the shipyard. I mean, we are modifying process and facilities that are existing today that are building the 10 or 11 ships that we have under construction, so we have got we got to actually do this investment in a way that does not disrupt the work that we are doing already, so there is a pretty synchronized plan for investment here that we are always modulating as we go forward, which throttles the spending a little bit. The main thing we want to say is that we are committed to making this investment. It is a top priority for us to invest in our core business and we are going to do that as prudently as we possibly can and it may be a bit lumpy in the way that comes out.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay. That is great. Then is there any update on, in terms of the plans on Avondale and either you had pushed off the JV discussion. Was there anything new happening there?
Barb Niland: Nothing new, what we have done is, we continue to look at all alternatives, including sale and we look at it daily. Let us just put it that way, so there is nothing new to report.
Sam Pearlstein: Thank you.
Barb Niland: You are welcome. Thanks for joining us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning. A couple of questions, first part are you able to quantify any of the positive and negative EACs?
Barb Niland: Well, yes. The favorable adjustments for, I think I talked a little bit about this earlier was risk retirement of VCS NCC programs as well as DDG, then a unfavorable I talked about was CVN 78 and then some little knits in that.
Robert Spingarn: Any dollar amounts?
Barb Niland: We have not given any dollar amounts. I could tell you when we were releasing the Q we had $92 million of favorable adjustments and $21 million unfavorable adjustments, so in net $71 million.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Well, thanks for that. Mike, for you got the 79 contract. We talked about in the past that it is a different contract structure and it does have a significantly lower ceiling. How do we think about margin mix at Newport News as we go forward here as you transition from 78 with the cost plus structure now 79 fixed-price steep share line et cetera, how do we think about that?
Mike Petters: Well, I think it is kind of fairly straightforward. It is a brand new contract. We are on the front end of it. We will not take credit for retiring the risk of the program until we have retired it. Working the risk register on that contract was what that negotiation was all about a why it took so long, so we will probably, as we do in all of our programs like this, we will start with a fairly modest booking rate until we retire risks associated with it and we step up into it. The mix at Newport News, though, so I would say directly, Rob, over the over the first couple of years of the program it is going to be pretty modest on 79. The mix at Newport News will still be driven by the submarine program, the refueling overhaul program and the carrier construction. The carrier construction is the one that over the next 5 to 10 years is going to change from being cost-type that it has been for the last that five or eight years or so to this price environment. On the on the back end of that, you would see more opportunity, but at the front end it is going to be pretty modest, so submarine is a fixed price environment, fixed-price incentive environment and the refueling are in a cost-type environment as well, so the mix is not going to change a whole lot on the front end I would say.
Robert Spingarn: Right, so that 79 would be, I do not know what? 20% of Newport News or some number like that 20%-30%?
Mike Petters: Yes. You take a really dull knife and you would say one-third, one-third, one-third, but that actually not too far off over time. On the front end of the program, you are buying material. We have been buying material, we have been doing some advanced construction, if you will. It will move ahead into labor in the middle and the back end of the program.
Robert Spingarn: Right. Then just the last question somewhat related, but as the Ohio-class replacement comes in, how you think about given the funding considerations you already addressed, is there a risk here that other things might get crowded out? We know the priority on SSBN, X is very high, are certain types of programs a greater risk of competing for money here, submarine versus carriers, versus resurface ships?
Mike Petters: I am not exactly sure how to handicap who, but I can tell you for certain that if you can't find a separate way to pay for the Ohio replacement program, other Navy ships will not be built and that is a big problem. I think the Congressional Research Service, a few years ago, put a report out that they had an estimate of maybe something like 50 ships would be changed. Their schedules would be change or not built at all, so as you try to handicap the success of any particular program in the next 5 to 10 years, it does not matter what the program is, you start with the question of how Ohio-class is being paid for. It is that important to this industry to get that sorted out. Now, my own view is that and we have talked about this for a long time, my own view is that the Navy has a priority list of carriers and submarines, destroyers and amphibs and kind of in that order and you know we been working really hard on the ambhib piece, because we have felt that that is where the pressure for funding is going into - the resources kind of run into where the demand line is. Some of what the Navy has said about how they might pay for things in a sequestered environment, they have actually started to talk about change in destroyer profiles. You can see that that if it gets funded out of the normal shipbuilding account, it will absolutely have a negative impact on our industry.
Robert Spingarn: Given that carriers are as important as they are in order to keep quantities, do you think maybe they just adjust center lines?
Mike Petters: Probably. The law of the land is that we have 11 aircraft carriers. That law has been reaffirmed by the Congress the last couple years, so in order to keep it at 11 from you know navy plan perspective. You got to keep the past going. I mean, if the navy's plan right now is CVN-80 is an FY'18 ship. That sits right in the middle of this whole debate.
Robert Spingarn: Right. Well, thank you very much for your color.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Sam McKelvey: Hi. This is Sam McKelvey on for Joe DeNardi.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Sam McKelvey: Good morning. Given what the stock did after the first quarter, I thought you would have been more aggressive with share repo in the second quarter. I mean, is the plan not to be more opportunistic during periods of underperformance and should we expect a more steady buyback?
Barb Niland: I think what you are seeing if you are really just looking at the share count, you are seeing the averaging effect. I think wait till next quarter, you will see a little different labor and the share count there. It is just timing.
Sam McKelvey: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning.
Myles Walton: The question I think it was because margins at Ingalls and Barb and Mike, I know you have both talked about healthy shipbuilding business at 9% plus margins, but it does not seem like you are kind of entering the promised land at Ingalls with 11 ships in production, kind of hitting serial production stride, I think this is the largest positives team adjustments quarter that you guys have put up. I am just curious in the near-term kind of next 18 months to 24 months is this a sweet spot for Ingalls' margins?
Barb Niland: Okay. I am going to take this one. I talked about the lumpiness. I always talk about the lumpiness on cash. There is lumpiness on the risk retirement. We had a great quarter at Ingalls several events. I will repeat my expectations at the end of the year are Ingalls margins will be in the 9-plus percent range. Please expect as of the end of the year our total margins of 11.5%. It is just all is related to timing of events that occurred.
Mike Petters: We have that ability. There are some quarters, where we do not the risk retirement that we are looking for or the schedule moves or something like that and it, surprises, is not right word, but it puts pressure the other way. That is why try to talk about this just not in one quarter, but talk about it over a about a period of time the businesses are going to operate in the 9% to 10% range.
Myles Walton: I am definitely not trying to suggest you are going to be 11% this year. I am just looking at that the risk in that business. It does look like you are in more or less you are kind of your heart of serial production where you want to be a few years ago. If 9% to 10% is a healthy range, then you are in the healthy part of where you want to be. Is it disconnected to think you would be in the upper end of the that healthy range of operating margins?
Mike Petters: Well, I think we have made great progress as you point out. We have made great progress in moving forward and getting these programs into serial production. Some of the serial production is the work that you are doing, but some of it is the working that you are bringing in. Bringing the LXR program forward is a very important piece for Ingalls and now I am kind of all the way back to my Ohio replacement discussion. Getting that program brought forward and bridging from the LPD serial production line that we had established through LPD-28 to LXR, That is certainly the most efficient way to drive that program and that becomes really important to where Ingalls goes over the next five years or so. We are doing really well at Ingalls right now after years of hard work to get to this point, but now it is a matter of making sure that we sustain it.
Myles Walton: Just a clarification, Barb, I think you said the that you were planning for this year slip into next year, just from a calibration perspective, I mean, will next year's CapEx be $50 million higher than this year's, because of that?
Barb Niland: It could be. Yes.
Myles Walton: Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Darryl Genovesi: Hi. Good morning everybody.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning.
Darryl Genovesi: Mike, just to follow-up on comment you just made a second ago regarding the kind of the transition from LPD-28 to LXR. Can you give us a little more on what that transition might look like, for instance, do you need another ship to kind of get you there. If so, do you think there is appetite either at the Navy or I guess more specifically on the Hill to make that happen and then kind of along the same lines when is the LXR class planning work scheduled to start?
Mike Petters: Yes. I mean there is a lot in that. I think the first thing that I would say is that because we were able to reset the LPD program and create the production line and have the success that we have had in that program, we were happy that the Navy and the Congress recognized that let us take advantage of that, let us make the LXR look more like an LPD than something else and let us bridge from the hot production line to that new class of ships and created the LPD-28. The LPD-28 really is the 12 LPD, which was what the original requirement for that program was in any event, so a lot of support for that from an operational standpoint and from an industrial base standpoint to drive through the success of the LPD program into the LXR program. Now how that plays out relative to the timing and the design pieces, the more we make it look like an LPD, the less you have to put into the design in terms of getting ready to start Closer you can get it to the production line of the LPD-28, the less need you would have for another opportunity to bridge, so all of that is sort to in play at this point clearly moving in the program forward is a big step, but I have to say that it is right in that sweet spot of how do you pay for ORP while you are doing this, so the Navy has I think done a really good thing here to try to button this thing up ahead of that program and we stay engaged with that process to make sure that they understand what it will take to be successful.
Darryl Genovesi: Great. Thanks for that. Then, Barb just on pension I think last year you had commented that I think 25% of the CAS harmonization benefit had come through to you in 2014. Assuming your CAS reimbursement this year's is in line with your guidance, is there a similar number for this year and in terms of how much of that CAS harmonization impact will have come through by the end of this year and how much remains?
Barb Niland: Let us say from a cash perspective, are you looking for the CAS recovery in excess of the cash contribution?
Darryl Genovesi: I was just looking for the absolute CAS reimbursement, but however you got it is fine.
Barb Niland: Okay. The CAS recovery in access of the cash contribution, we expect it to be around $140 million for the year.
Darryl Genovesi: Right. I guess, what I was getting at is, last year you had commented that 25% of the CAS harmonization benefit had come through right?
Barb Niland: Last year was like $68 million.
Darryl Genovesi: Okay. I guess, what I am asking is if you have essentially realized all of the benefit from that as you plan to at this point or if there is a further step up to come in 2016?
Barb Niland: Harmonization won't be complete yet, so we will still have a little bit of a benefit.
Darryl Genovesi: Okay, but you do not have the analogous 25% number versus?
Barb Niland: Since it goes in ratable, so it is 25% and 50%, 75% and 100%.
Darryl Genovesi: So this is 50?
Barb Niland: Right.
Darryl Genovesi: That will be over four years?
Barb Niland: Right.
Darryl Genovesi: Okay. Great. Then, I guess just with the move up in interest rates that we have seen year-to-date, does that impact your view on how much to kind of refund the plan here over the next couple of years or you are sort of thinking about independently about it?
Barb Niland: Well, actually I think I included that in the thought process, so when you think of the improvement in the discount rates, it has not solved all the problems. I think we had a 24 basis point improvements since December year end, so certainly it give us a change in our pension liabilities, significant change. I think it is like $220 million, but when I look at my asset returns through the end of June, I am looking at about a 50-basis point asset - or 0.5% return. If you recall my assumption and all my analysis is a long-term rate of return of 7.5%. Now last time I looked about two weeks ago we were 2.1%, so the volatility of that, so I have to look at everything. I have to look at certainly increasing in the discount rate solve a lot of problems, but the flipside of that is my asset returns have been a little weaker than they were in the past couple of years.
Darryl Genovesi: Great. Thanks very much.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Gavin Parsons: This is Gavin Parsons on for Noah. Good morning everyone.
Barb Niland: Good morning, Gavin.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Gavin Parsons: Taking kind of longer-term view, you talk a little bit about two to three years just being the timeframe where Department of Energy opportunities really start materialize, and you kind of sized a pretty large market there. I was wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit about kind of how you are planning for that currently and how you think about your current scale and capabilities relative to that $60 billion you have talked about?
Mike Petters: Yes. First that $60 billion is over the next 10 years, not over the next two or three. The first of those opportunities come up in the next two or three, so what we have been working on is establishing the relationships with the other folks in the industry to determine how best to prosecute those opportunities as they come forward. We have had the our acquisition of Stoller and the creation of SN3 has put us in a really good place to be a good partner or maybe even more as we go forward into that business. At this point, it is we are right on the very front into that.
Gavin Parsons: Okay. Great. On unmanned, navy, actually were to - decently sized contract last month. I was just wondering if you are still thinking about it as more of an experimental market or if you are seeing kind of more support in funding and how you think about the market size over the next decade or so?
Mike Petters: I am sorry on which market?
Gavin Parsons: Umanned.
Mike Petters: Unmanned, I am sorry. I think, and I admit my safe harbor provision here be in a former submarine guy, I think the undersea domain is a space where there is going to be lots of opportunity. The question is, is there going to be a lot funding there. I do think that there will probably be opportunity to translate some of what is happening on the commercial side of the industry undersea to what the requirements might be for the Navy and for the Pentagon. Our acquisition from the Columbia Group earlier this year kind of puts us in a little bit different place than we have been before to kind of marry up our submarine experienced here in Newport News with some of the rest of that market space. We have done some things there, but we now have entrée and presence that we have not had before, so we are excited about that market. We want to make sure that we go where our partner and where our customer wants to go there and make sure that we support them in the best way possible.
Gavin Parsons: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I am showing a follow-up question from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky: Hi, guys. It is Jason. Thanks. Mike just a quick question for you on the cash flows and CapEx. Can you provide here in the near-term for 2015 just the varied moving pieces that could push cash flows either higher or lower just kind of as you the back half of the year that things here sort of maybe got some variability to them. Then on CapEx as we move out into 2016, you talked a bit about something slipping from this year going into the next. As you are assessing what happens going forward, what are the major topics that you are trying to get your head around with regard to CapEx is it things that within your control or you are waiting on others to make some decisions? Just help us better understand the topics that you are [ph] CapEx levels we are going to look like going forward? Thanks.
Mike Petters: I will take the CapEx one first. As I said we are actually investing pretty heavily in a shipyard that is operating at a pretty good pace right now, so if we going to go in and modify a process flow or the facilities tooling in a particular facility, we have to do that in a way that does not disrupt the current practice or the current flow that we need to have through that facility. We actually are managing this from what is the program plan for how we implement this. As the ships are kind of moving through the manufacturing phases and we want to go and put in some new facility or some new equipment and maybe some automation, we have to decide when is the best time to cut that into the facility and we have a lot of flexibility there, but it is kind of dynamic but we have to be very coordinated and synchronized as we go and do that, which whether we are talking about the something as kind of binary as the launching dock or something more like modifications to our whole fabrication facility now all those parts are moving, so that is how it becomes pretty lumpy. It is kind of hard to handicap how that is going to play over the next month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter, but our message is that we are committed to making the investment and it is not a question of if, it is more of the question of when. I guess the other question was about cash and I will let Barb take that.
Barb Niland: Yes. I think that I have talked about earlier that CapEx has a percent of revenue would be in the 4% range. The rest of it will slide to 2016. Earlier I think it might be Pete or someone asked me about $50 million sliding into 2016. That is about right. It depends on whether we spend the rest of it this year or not. We have planned projects. It is just the timing of releasing those projects.
Jason Gursky: Okay. Other areas of cash flow, my question was a little bit more geared toward other moving pieces as you look out into the end of the second half of the year that could move cash either higher or lower just kind of worry point I suppose?
Barb Niland: Move cash higher or lower I mean really is timing of receipts, receivables, what happens at the end of the year, it will be timing of CapEx and whether we can fund it. Somebody asked me if we could spend it. Sometimes they surprised me how fast they can spend it. Like I said we have projects in place, so it is not a free checkbook for them and I think we have finished all our pension contributions, our discretionary for qualified plans pension contribution, so I think I have covered all that the big cash puts and takes. Just remember that litigation settlement that we had the $150 million, I have to give some of that back to the government and pay cash taxes on that, so do not count that as $150 million. I think I hit the big things that affect cash there for you.
Jason Gursky: Okay. That is perfect. That was what I was looking for. I appreciate it.
Barb Niland: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I am showing a follow-up from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Yes. A couple of follow-up, so let me start with cash deployment. Hey guys, the insurance recovery it looks like if we look out the balance sheet is in good health and the free cash, I would think you have got pretty good visibility, but a pretty good converter. It seems like you can probably ramp up the share repurchases, maybe at least like $200 million a year or so, particularly when the stock is trading. I just want to get your updated thoughts kind of post the kind of M&A phase you have been through here. Shift on the capital deployment fronts just your thought that would be great? Thanks.
Mike Petters: Well, our thinking on this in some ways is maturing. We have come through a phase since 2011 where we have been focusing on operational efficiency and we have been looking for opportunities to create new value. We are in a place now and we have been talking about balanced cash deployment schedule. How we think about it today is that our first priority, we still want to be fairly balanced, but our first priority is to invest in our core business, so we have gone forward and we have made sure that it is clear, the kind of things we are investing in and that you see we have had a lot of discussions this morning about capital. We will continue to look for ways to create new value in the business. We have had some success there and we have had some learning there as well. As we go forward, we factor that into the way we think about those opportunities and we have been bringing the shareholders along and there is probably opportunity to do even more of that going forward. I do not want on front of my border or anything else, but I think we want to continue with a balanced plan and prioritize towards investing in our core business with a thought towards how we create new value and a commitment to bringing our shareholders along, so.
Pete Skibitski: It is very helpful, Mike, Thank you. Just last follow-up for you, could you talk about this idea I think NFC is [ph] considering of having commercial companies maybe do nearly the full deactivation of the enterprise. I know that is being t talked about. I just want to how far along that is at this point, and could there be an opportunity for you guys?
Mike Petters: Well, we are doing the inactivation of the ship right now in the shipyard and the question that you are asking is, so what happens after we finish. I think that discussion is ongoing with our customer, what is the right thing to do and how is the best and most efficient way to get this done. If there is an opportunity for us to participate in that, we will pay close attention to it. We certainly bring some skills to this today that we did not necessarily bring to it, maybe five years ago with the creation of SN3 and environmental work that Stoller does and those kinds of things. We do bring some capability there that we did not have before and there are other players in the industry that are willing to participate in this as well. There is a lot more to come on this, I think, but at this point, we are all trying to talk about how is the most efficient way to get this done.
Pete Skibitski: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This now does end our Q&A session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Petters for any closing remark.
Mike Petters: All right. Thank everybody for their participation today and for your interest in our company. I do want to let you know that we have come through. We started in 2011 and said where we are going to be at by the end of 2015. As we come up to the end of 2015, we do recognize that we need to tell you where we are going from here. To that end, we are planning for an investors' conference to be held in New York on November 10th. We will have a reception on the night before that and we will have a chance for you to come and see and talk with our leadership team about all the different parts of our business. We would like for you to if you do not mind consider this save the date announcement, if you will, November 10th, we would be happy to see you in New York. Thanks for your interest in our company and we look forward to seeing you soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Q1 2015 Earnings Call. At this me, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct to question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over Mr. Dwayne Blake, Corporate Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Candice. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries' first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer and Barb Niland, Corporate Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in their remarks today, Mike and Barb will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including certain segment and adjusted financial measures.

We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
Mike Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, we released first quarter 2015 financial results to reflect steady operating margin performance and improved cash generation. Ingalls and Newport News had another solid quarter, while UniversalPegasus continues to be affected by the prolonged weakness in the oil and gas market. For the quarter, sales of $1.6 billion were slightly lower than last year and segment operating margin was 8.2%, down from 8.6% last year. Diluted EPS was $1.79 for the quarter, down from a $1.81, last year. Q1 results include $0.13 impact from the Other segment. We were a net user in the quarter, however operating cash flow improved by over $200 million from last year. Additionally, we received $1.6 billion in new contract awards during the quarter, resulting in backlog of approximately $21 billion of which $14 billion is funded. Since our Q4 earnings call in February, FY'16 defense budget discussions in Washington have been ongoing with what appears to be a healthy debate about ways to mitigate the adverse implications of sequestration. While no decisions have been made, we are encouraged by the ongoing budget deliberations and remain hopeful that the defense authorization and appropriations process will proceed in regular order. At the same time, we will continue to closely monitor the process for all our programs with a particular focus on LPD 28, CVN 73, RCOH, CVN 79 and CVN 80. Now, I will provide a few points of interest on our programs. At Ingalls NSC-5 James completed successful acceptance trials last week and is preparing for delivery to the customer in June. In addition, the contract award of the eighth National Security Cutter at the end of March reinforces the Coast Guard's commitment to leveraging the benefits of serial production of program that continues to perform extremely well. Ingalls also christened LPD 26. John P. Murtha and launched DDG-113 John Finn during the quarter, representing achievement of significant milestones in the construction of these vessels. At Newport News, the test program on CVN 78 Ford is progressing and delivery remains on track for the first half of 2016. For CVN 79 Kennedy, we still expect the detailed design and construction contract to be awarded in the second quarter of this year. In addition, SSN 785 John Warner is preparing for sea trials with delivery slated for next month. Our display of Proteus, a submersible undersea vehicle built by our recently acquired Undersea Solutions Group, Battelle and Bluefin Robotics created long lines and lot of excitement at the annual Navy League Sea-Air-Space Exposition last month. Proteus is designed to be manually crude or to function as an autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle. We see Proteus as a key component in our pursuit of opportunities in the unmanned submersibles market. Regarding UniversalPegasus, I talked about specific actions we were taking to position this business for long-term success during our call last quarter. These difficult, but necessary actions include a 30% workforce reduction and a restructuring of UPI's benefit and compensation programs, which are expected to reduce overhead costs by 25% over the next 12 months. Even with these cost reductions, market conditions will continue to impact performance. While none of us can predict when the market will turn, UPI will be position to provide our customer base with high-quality products and services to help them complete their projects safely, on schedule and on budget. Although the delay in award of the contract for CVN 79 may impact volume at Newport News on a full-year basis, I remain confident in our ability to maintain 9-plus percent operating margin in our shipbuilding business for 2015. We will maintain our relentless focus on program execution and continue investing capital in our shipbuilding businesses to improve operational efficiency and position ourselves for future Navy programs. We will also continue distributing cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks subject to board approval and continue evaluating M&A opportunities to provide long-term value creation. With all that being said, when people talk about Huntington Ingalls, the discussion is typically all about navy shipbuilding. However, since January of 2014, we have made three acquisitions that leverage our core competencies in nuclear operations and engineering and program management. I am excited about the future as our company is well-positioned to provide innovative solutions for our Navy customer in the traditional shipbuilding, repair and fleet services markets as well as in the unmanned submersible's market. We have also expanded our ability to compete for engineering and environmental services opportunities for the Department of Energy and commercial nuclear markets and engineering services for the oil and gas market. These strategic actions have form a strong foundation for the future as we continue exploring opportunities to create long-term sustainable value for our customers, employees and shareholders. That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barb Niland: Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. Starting with the consolidated results for the quarter on Slide 4 of the presentation, revenues of $1.57 billion in the quarter decreased 1.5%, due primarily to lower volumes at Ingalls. Segment operating income decreased 7% in the quarter to $128 million and segment operating margin was 8.2%. Total operating income decreased 2% in the quarter to $156 million and total operating margin was 9.9%. These decreases were primarily due to underperformance at UPI as a result of continued weakness in the oil and gas market. Excluding UPI, segment operating income and in the quarter $137 million, which was consistent with Q1 2014 and segment operating margin was 9%, a 36 basis points improvement over the same period last year. Excluding UPI, total operating income was $165 million, a $6 million increase over Q1 2014 and total operating margin was 10.8 %, which is 81 basis points over the same period last year. As expected, we were net user of cash in the quarter; cash used in operating activities was $3 million, $211 million improvement over the first quarter of 2014. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $20 million compared to $24 million last year. We successfully closed on the sale of Gulfport facility and collected approximately $32 million in proceeds. Now that we have sold the facility, we will focus our attention on reaching a final agreement with the customer on treatment of the remaining closure costs, so that we can begin the recovery process. Additionally, we contributed $2 million of the planned $99 million discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans. We intend to fund the balance in the second quarter. We also purchased approximately 210,000 shares at a cost of $29 million during the quarter and paid dividends of $0.40 per share or $19 million brining our quarter end cash balance to $904 million. Before I move on to the segment results, let me give you a quick update on Avondale facility. As you may have already seen from the press release a couple weeks ago, we ended the study with Kinder Morgan and have mutually agreed not to pursue a joint venture using the facility. We will continue to explore other alternatives for future use of the facility, including a sale. We have also submitted an updated proposal to the Navy, which reflects a revised estimated restructuring cost of $287 million or $3 million increase over the previous proposal. As a reminder, once a final agreement is reached with the Navy, the restructuring cost will be recovered by our billing rates over a five-year period. Now moving onto segment results on Slide 5 Ingalls' revenues of $469 million, declined 14% for the same period last year, driven the deliveries of LHA-6 and NSC-4 and lower volumes on LPD programs. Operating margin of 9.6% in the quarter increased 173 basis points over the first quarter 2014, primarily due to risk retirement on LHA-6. Turning to Slide 6, Newport News first quarter revenues of $1.1 billion increased 1% over the same period last year, due to higher volumes on the VCS program and on aircraft carrier maintenance. This was partially offset by lower volumes on CVN-72 RCOH and the construction contract for CVN-78. Operating margin for the quarter was 8.8%, down 21 basis points from the same period last year, due to lower risk retirement CVN-78, which was partially offset by higher risk retirement on the VCS program. Now, onto the other segment, which consists primarily of UPI, in the first quarter the segment generated an operating loss of $10 million on revenues of $40 million, lower volumes due to project delays and works scope reductions as well as the cost to restructure the business in light of the downturn in the oil and gas market negatively impacted UPI performance in the quarter. As Mike mentioned, we continue to take aggressive actions at UPI, but the reality is, market conditions will dictate how these action affect the bottom-line for the remainder of the year, and without a favorable turn in the market, we will continue to see pressure in the business. However, we believe the actions we have taken will strengthen the company for the long-term. Let me provide you with an update on deferred state taxes. We are now expecting a benefit of approximately $5 million for the year instead of the $20 million I provided on the Q4 2014 earnings call. As you know, our estimate of deferred state taxes can fluctuate significantly due to timing of contract income for tax purposes, so each quarter we will provide you with an update of our best estimate for the year. That concludes my remarks for the quarter, and I will turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne Blake: Thanks, Barb. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Candice, I will turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Good morning, Doug.
Barb Niland: Good morning.
Doug Harned: I am interested in Newport News, because the margins were a little less than they have been in recent periods. You this attributed this to lower risk retirement on the CVN-78, but do you see this is a one-quarter event or are we entering a period where there may be some more difficulty in bringing risk down on that program?
Mike Petters: Well, thanks, Doug. A couple of quarters ago, we talked about Newport News was going to be window here, where they are a little bit out of balance. Starting with the delivery of the Ford for next year, following that will be the delivery of the Lincoln and the delivery of the Enterprise from the Lincoln from RCOH and Enterprise from inactivation. We have three carrier deliveries in the next 21 months out of Newport News and all of that work is cost-type work and all of that work is the last year of a carrier project. We do not yet have the contract for CVN-79. We talked about this before. There needs to be a balance in the business of new work coming in along with old, with work that you are retiring. Relative to the risk retirement on these various programs, the Ford has come together really well. Frankly, I still insist that this was in terms of the construction side of it, it was the very best the lead ship that I have ever seen in terms of things coming together and being complete and ready for test. There is a lot of new technology on that ship and we are just being very mindful as we walk our way through to delivery in the first half of next year about risk retirement. Have we really retired the risk? Do we really understand what we have got there? I think that certainly the awarding of a contract for CVN-79 will help this, and we are not backing away from our view that for this full year period, Newport News will be at 9% or better, but I think it is going to be a little bit of a lumpy ride or bumpy ride between here and there and really a bumpy ride between here and over the next 21 months.
Barb Niland: I got to say, in Q1 2014, when you had risk retirement on 78, you had akin-correct [ph] effect of that which made it have a bigger impact. When you do not have akin [ph] correct for the risk retirement this quarter, you have lower margins.
Doug Harned: Then just separately on CapEx. I mean, CapEx was low for the quarter, I think, about 1.6 % of revenues and you have said that you are headed toward the 3% to 4 % type of CapEx level going forward, so should we expect significant increases later this year? What does that CapEx profile look like now?
Barb Niland: Okay. I believe I said on the call, the total CapEx would be like between 4.5% and 5%, so somewhere between 4% and 5% is my expectations for the year, the reason why you are not seeing a bump up is, one, the CVN-79 contract has been delayed and some of that capital was contingent on receipt of that contract based on that contract structure and being able to get the returns generated, so until we have that final contract signed, we won't release the capital associated with that. Then the other thing I believe I told you was, we allocated a little bit of money for some engineering studies at Ingalls and until those studies show the returns that we need there and the efficiencies and improvement to capture the future opportunities for Ingalls, we are not going to release that capital. I would say there is pressures, a down spend [ph] 5%, but it will be in the 4% range and I will keep you posted as we get to the second quartet.
Mike Petters: I would just add, Doug that our intent here is to invest in our core business, and we plan to invest in a substantial way. We are also going to do that in a very thoughtful way. As the business moves around, the investment profile will move around to reflect that, so I think we are committed to doing that and committed to driving efficiencies and improvements in the business and driving more affordability into the business, but we need to do that in a really smart way.
Doug Harned: Okay. Thank you very much.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Crédit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning, Mike and Barb.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Morning.
Robert Spingarn: I wanted to ask you on, first going back to Newport News and following on to last question, with the CVN-79 coming in, I understand that that certainty of getting a contract to positive gets work flowing, but given the fixed-price nature of the contract and the fact that you generally start off booking conservatively, what might we not expect that to crush or bring margins down at Newport News for period of time?
Mike Petters: Well, I think it will be part of the plan [ph], and that is why I say we got a little bit out of balance. I think it is the more immediate impact to the yard is that as work completes on these various other projects, the management of the workforce in the yard and how it flows from one project to another is a little bit out of sequence and I think that is what the programs are actually seeing down on the deckplay. In terms of the returns in the business, my expectation is that the business will stay at 9%, but we got work our way through these three deliveries and we got work through the startup and 79. The reality is that we have been building units for CVN-79 for a couple years, so we got a good start on that program.
Robert Spingarn: Mike, are those the modulars, the things you can sort of build with advanced procurement, but then as you put the ship in drydock and start assembling everything together, does that change the dynamic?
Mike Petters: Certainly, I mean, we are coming through the manufacturing phase of CVN-79, there is a lot of work on CVN-79 going on in the yard, but it is the turning the yard lose to go execute all those other parts of the program that have to be executed to make it successful at delivery. That is what this contract, the detailed design and construction contract will do for us. The advanced construction, advance procurement that we are doing is very specific to material procurement and specific modules that we agree with the Navy that need to be done to keep the ship on schedule.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Then just a higher-level question, I have asked this before, but here we are now getting well into '15. At what point do you think, if ever, are you going to be comfortable guiding?
Barb Niland: I have hit him too hard, Rob.
Mike Petters:
Robert Spingarn: Yes. Well, ouch.
Robert Spingarn: Not meant to be too harsh, but we are kind of at that point. The performance has been excellent. You have hit the targets that you have set, even a little bit early. You have been sufficiently cautious where needed. I understand that this UPI and the oil and gas is a curveball, but even guiding axe that, is that something you can do?
Mike Petters: At this point, we do not really have a plan to begin providing guidance. Our view of the business is that, our task is to achieve the full potential of this business, so that is what we will continue to go do. I like the way that this worked out since 2011, when we said this is what we think this business is going to be in 2015. If we do something to provide a of view of what do we think this business is going to be in a in a few years from now, we may have that discussion later this year, but I am not sure of that. We are not a quarter-to-quarter business. As you can see that in some of our programs, the way these things play out, in some cases we are not even a year-to-year business, so I am at this point thinking more about what does this business look like in three to five-year timeframe as opposed to where we are we going to specifically be at the end of this year.
Robert Spingarn: Right, but you are saying or maybe Barb said earlier, at least with UPI this June quarter could look somewhat similar. The pressure is still there.
Barb Niland: UPI? Correct.
Mike Petters: Yes. There's still market pressure at UPI, but on the other hand, we have taken some pretty dramatic steps there that we think will help that business certainly over the course of this year, but also positions it well for the inevitable rebound in that market space. We have a business there that has a great set of customers, they had some big wins in the second half of last year that projects that they won that have now been slowed down or delay and our challenge is to make sure that we maintain the customer contact with those projects, so that when those projects start back up we are ready to provide the quality work that we needed to go do. When they will start back up is, I am not exactly sure. We been looking at this from a standpoint of making sure that we maintain the customer contact and the quality capability that we have to have to support that and some of that will play out over the next couple of quarters.
Robert Spingarn: Now, that is certainly understandable. Thank you.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning.
Sam Pearlstein: You talked about the restructuring in the Other segment, can you size how much that restructuring cost might have been?
Barb Niland: Sure. Out of that $10 million loss, $9 million was specifically related to UPI. If you recall, when we acquired UPI, we set up our Waggaman facility, it was called AEC, and Waggaman was rally to do like the machining and fabrication for the oil and gas market in the Gulf region and support UPI. We closed that facility, so of $10 million, about $1.5 million was for the closure of Waggaman, about little less than $2 million was related to restructuring, so that was separation costs, things like that. Then if you think about it, a $1.5 was related to purchase intangibles, so that is about half of it. Then the other half of was volume impacting performance.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay. Given the downturn, at what point do you reassess the goodwill position in the intangibles and is there any sense that where you have that much change?
Barb Niland: Actually, we reassess it every quarter. We reassess it based on the customer, whether there are cancellations or project delays. We reassess it based on performance, we reassess it based on market conditions, so we look at all of that and we assess our ability when the market comes back to come out in a positive way, which is why we are trying it maintain the skill sets we need to, so when the projects that have been delayed get turned on, we will be successful and those partners will continue with us.
Sam Pearlstein: Okay. Thank you.
Barb Niland: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.
Pete Skibitski: Good morning, guys.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning, Keith.
Pete Skibitski: I guess, I was looking for maybe some more color about Ingalls just on the top-line and so far as you have had a couple quarters in a row now of double-digit declines there the top-line, is that just kind of timing related or directionally is that kind of the magnitude of headwinds that you are facing there?
Barb Niland: In terms of the volume, we did have a lighter month and part of that a lighter quarter and part of that was we had a very strong quarter in the fourth quarter related to material receipts and payments last year. When you compare Q1 of this year to Q1 of last year, we also had accelerated last year's accounts payable, because we were implementing a new system called MARS, Ingalls, so we were very heavy in the first quarter of 2014 in terms of accounts payable. Volumes, we are expecting to be the same pretty close to last year at Ingalls, so we just had a light quarter primarily attributable to very strong fourth quarter in 2014 and we expect it to be a little higher for the rest of the year.
Pete Skibitski: Got it. Okay. Very helpful. Then just, Barbra, on the working capital performance probably I think the best first quarter you have had in like five years. I am just wondering how you think about the rest of year, because I know you do not have the LHA-6 for retention release this year like last year, so I just wondered does this give you the confidence that you can get to one times free cash conversion this year or because it is such a strong start, are you thinking maybe you can exceed that this year like you did last year?
Barb Niland: I always tell you that it really depends on really the last three days of the year end collections, so I would love to have another performance like last year. I expect us from a segment cash to do pretty well this year. We do have the delivery of one of the NFCs this year, so we will collect that retention. That is all in our plan I would say, I saw lower disbursements [ph] was the biggest driver in the first quarter being less seasonably unfavorable than in the past, but I think cash, you know, it all depends on the last three days year is what I will tell you.
Pete Skibitski: Fair enough. Thanks so much guys.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.
John - Citi: Hi. Good morning. It is actually John [ph] on for Jason.
Mike Petters: Hi, John.
Barb Niland: Good morning. Hi. Barb, could you talk about just EPS cadence this year. You mentioned how Ingalls should be ramping upon the top-line over the course of the year. Can you touch upon any other elements we should be thinking about how we get from this quarter's results through what I assume should be a hopefully better results over the course of the year?
Barb Niland: Well, I think, Mike has talked about at Newport News, we will expect the total year operating margin to be 9%, at Newport News. Ingalls is 9% and Ingalls volume we expect to pick up a bit, so I think that will get you to the EPS. We do have pressure with UPI that I talked about. We think we have right-sized it, but if there is continued delays on project and everything, we could see a little more bleed out there, but I think we are on the right path.
John - Citi: Okay. Then on cash deployment, you touched upon sort of all the options in your prepared remarks. Could you just comment a little more into the kind of obstacles you are seeing other gates with the go through [ph] see more repo as a goal on repo to keep share down or drop share count a little bit here? On the related note, is M&A, has the focus changed at all over the last year, any particular accretion targets and market targets that you are looking at just given the fact that Proteus acquisition has been exciting where as UPI has been a little less so.
Mike Petters: Fair enough. First of all, nothing happens in this business unless we are successfully executing in our core business, so as we have talked about, we are going to be investing in our core business to make sure that our programs remain affordable and that we remain effective and efficient at providing those platforms for our primary customer, the Navy. We have been bringing our shareholders along with us over this the last four years and we will continue to do so. We expect to do this in a very balanced way, because we do think that there are opportunities for us to provide some of this tremendous capability that is in this business to new customers and finding the best way to create access to those new customers is very important to us, because I think that that is a part of our task of achieving the full potential of the business. I think we can do all of that. I think we can invest in our core business, I think we can bring our shareholders along and I think that we can continue to create new value for new customers in those things that we are particularly really good at, so that is kind of our approach to it at this point.
John - Citi: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning, Myles.
Myles Walton: You talked about balanced capital deployment and the last questions was on deals that you have done. I am curious in terms of the size of deals, do you have a scope limitation? Would you entertain multibillion-dollar, $200 billion deals over the next 12 months to 24 months? Is that something that is within the scope of possibility?
Mike Petters: That is a great question, Myles. I mean, I guess, at this point I would say, my aperture is, I try to keep it is wide open as possible, because I keep coming back to, we got to find the full potential of the business. If there was something out there like that, that would allow us to achieve full potential, we would have to have to give that some consideration. On the other hand, our approach has been pretty much what you have seen. The acquisition of the Undersea Group was really about technology and a capability that we thought married up well with capability that we already have, similar to what we did was Stoller, we aligned into, we created access to the Department of Energy that while we had great capability in our business for that marketplace, we did have great access. Stoller brings great capability and great access, so we are able to leverage that and we saw the same thing with UPI. I probably was the only person on the planet that did not know that the price of oil was going to drop after we did that acquisition, but having said that, the reason we did was all of the same reasons that we did the other acquisitions and I am excited about what we are doing it at UPI and I am excited about the access that we have created to that market space for capabilities that we have. I won't tell you that we out there trying to find that that home run. We are out there trying to create sustainable value and access to customers for great capability that we have.
Myles Walton: Okay. One clean up question, Barb, what was the net akin [ph] catches in the quarter?
Barb Niland: $55 million.
Myles Walton: Okay. All right. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Yes. Good morning, Barb.
Barb Niland: Good morning, George.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
George Shapiro: Barb, I kind of had a different take on cash flow that effectively the differences due to trade accounts and payables, which to me is timing and on the other hand receivables actually went up by more than last year at $189 million and that probably included the $30 million that you got from selling Gulfport, so can you just walk me through why the receivables would have gone up so much in the quarter?
Barb Niland: Receivables are up and they are primarily up at Newport News, and it is really just timing of collection, okay? The first semis [ph] were down at Ingalls and now it is because of the material in the fourth quarter of 2014.
George Shapiro: Okay. Then one for you, Mike. if you look at this top-down, everybody was fairly critical of making it diversification attempt and when you are in the defense business and so far this UPI acquisition and timing and what is happened looks like it would validate that concern. I mean, how do you kind of look at it at this point in time?
Mike Petters: Well, as I said, the way I look at this is that we have great capability in the organization and there are customers out there that need access to this capability and our job to achieve our potential is to try to find, create channels for those customers and that capability. I think the jury is still out on UPI and I am not one yet to say that has not worked out. My view of it is, this is a company that has a great set of customers that had some big wins in the fall, the market dynamic that is way beyond anybody's control and it has put a lot of those projects on hold. We have gone through a pretty healthy process of resizing that business which is going to make it an even stronger business when the market comes back and history shows that the market does go back and forth in the space. It is a capability that we actually have a lot of our own capability. I mean, it is in the engineering services and engineering design capability that we have resident in our Shipbuilding business, so there is a lot of affinity there between what we do in our core business and what happens in that space, so we are creating a channel there that I think to a marketplace that I think long-term is going to be a pretty robust marketplace, so I am pretty excited about where - that is a capability that this company did not have four years ago and I am pretty happy to have it at this point.
George Shapiro: I mean, if you had waited four or five months, you probably could have bought it for a lot less?
Barb Niland: You are right.
Mike Petters: Sure. Like I said, I was the only guy that did not know that George, so that one is on me.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much, Mike.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.
Pete Skibitski: Yes. A couple of follow-ups, guys. First, a couple of housekeeping questions, Barb, can you tell us what your full-year expectations for D&A as well as for cash taxes?
Barb Niland: Okay. For cash taxes federal and state around 250, but I am going caveat that, so it is all dependent on timing of ship deliveries, changes in pension and things like that. What was your other question?
Pete Skibitski: D&A full year expectation.
Barb Niland: Okay. I do not think I have provided that in the past.
Pete Skibitski: Okay.
Barb Niland: I mean, I would say do not expect any significant big movement one way or another. How about that?
Pete Skibitski: Okay. Fair enough. Then, Mike, I wondered if you could share with us your thoughts on how the congressional committee so far has touched your programs in terms of the fiscal '16 budget positive or negative? Then how far along are we in terms of kind of your ability to get some assuredness on the timing for the GW RCOH and the 12th LPD-17, so just wondering kind of what the next big milestones are before you can kind of to get some visibility on those programs?
Mike Petters: Sure. As I said, I am a big fan of the regular order process that our government uses to establish priorities and put resources against that. Last year as you know, the government put $1 billion up for LPD-28, which has really turned into something that has been helpful to the Navy and certainly to us in terms of defining our future. Along those lines, that been prompted the Navy to make a decision that the follow-on amphibious class LXR would essentially be a version of the LPD and we think that is the key decision, because that drives the program schedule in a positive way. That program needs to come in to keep the hot production line that we have at Ingalls working. All of that has come together in a way that so far the only committee that has come out in 2016 has been the House Armed Services Committee and we are long ways from law at this point, but the Defense Authorization Act from the House Armed Services Committee has been very, very strongly supportive of Shipbuilding across the board and across the country, particularly to our programs trying to make sure that we take full advantage of last year's decisions around amphibs is part of the language they put in place, but also in regard to the RCOHs, let us not go through is it end or is it out for the rest of the RCOHs. Let us get all of those RCOHs authorized and moved ahead and keep them on schedule, because that we are going to have - because of the discussion around CVN-73, part of the imbalance at Newport News over the next couple of years is that when the CVN-72 leaves the CVN-73 won't be coming in at that point. There is going to be a bit of a gap, so that is a part of the imbalances at Newport News that has been created in this political environment and this discussion about how can you - we are not have yet a discussion about how many carriers we need. We are actually having a discussion about how can we most efficiently buy them. Are they economic order quantities that we could make sense when we buy more than one ship set material at a time? I am old enough to remember that we bought two carriers at a time twice back in the 80s for construction that finished in the 90s. Those were very efficient programs and very efficient ways to build those platforms that the nation needs, so what I see in this regular order process and why I am a big fan of it is, you actually have a chance to vet all of those issues and get them out and allow decision-makers to establish what their priorities are and put resources against it. There has been very strong support for Shipbuilding and there has been really good support for our programs. For that, I am very, very happy about that.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. It sounds like you are a lot more comfortable on the LPD outlook. Is sequestration still a risk for you guys? Do you feel or there is kind of OCO-driven work around. Does that kind of obviate that risk at least maybe for a couple of years or something. How do you think about?
Mike Petters: Well, I mean, obviously, I think sequestration is a wet blanket for everybody. I still, as I have said before, it is absolutely no way to run the best country on the planet and we have got to get rid of the mechanism and we have got to think about what our priorities are and what the resources are that go against that, so I do not exactly know how we are going to find our way through that, but I do believe that we will find our way through it. There will be a path of some sort that is going to go forward and in that environment whenever that path is whether it is an OCO path or Ryan-Murray II kind of thing or whatever it is, whatever that path is, what I see is Shipbuilding programs are being very well supported in that environment.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
George Shapiro: Yes. Barb or Mike, I wanted to ask a General Dynamics had like 19% growth in their Marine business and some of the stuff they do was not comparable, but they did highlight that the primary reason for the growth was the Virginia class, so if could just go through that what maybe the accounting differences in terms of your booking of revenues on the Virginia class, just so I can get a better understanding of why they would be such a disparity?
Barb Niland: I mean, we said we had like 1% growth at Newport News and it was a primarily driven by VCS because we had lower sales on CVN-78 and on the RCOH, so it is really our mixed is difference and there they have ORP and Block IV the two subs per year Block IV driving it. We have a small amount of ORP and the two sub per year is, we are seeing growth in VCS, but we are seeing lower volume on CVN-78 as we get to delivery and lower volume on CVS-72.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Barb Niland: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.
John: Hi, it is John again. Thanks again for the follow-up. I just on Avondale, I was wondering how the end of the JV study has perhaps reaccelerated the Navy negotiation and to what extent has the menu of options for Avondale contracted? Is it only full sale or full closure at this point? Then finally is there any sort of timing that you are thinking about there?
Barb Niland: Okay. Look, we have an obligation to look at every opportunity we can, so once the Kinder Morgan, we could not find our way to repurpose that facility with them. It opened the doors for others, but the plan right now is closure. We will look at sale as part of that. As far as timing goes, we resubmitted our proposal based on the Kinder Morgan decision to the government and we will work with them to negotiate that going forward.
John: Is there any events around negotiating that and getting Avondale close that could precipitate some sort of cash deployment decisions. Is that something the Board is focused on and wants to see again your before?
Mike Petters: I would say that we are proceeding at pace that we need to - as we shift from the space we have had with Kinder Morgan - we have had a lot of attention on and a lot of energy in that. We are now moving into another phase and we will work our way through that at an appropriate pace. I am not sure if there is any sort of triggering event there of any kind.
John: Okay. Thank you.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Crédit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert Spingarn: Hi. Just wanted to come back to the carriers again and to the mix, Mike, as you shift from CVN-78 to CVN-79 assuming you get the contract on CVN-79, when you are hoping for it. If we just look at the next few years, what is the point at CVN-79 is driving more revenue than CVN-78?
Mike Petters: Well, certainly by next spring when CVN-78 is gone.
Robert Spingarn: Well, yes, but we know these things have trailing revenues and so on, so looked hard for us to see from the outside just exactly how that mix when that shift change occurs?
Mike Petters: I mean, we do not typically breakout all out by programs much less by ship type, but this is the program that we have already been working on for a couple of years, so it has already been part of our base. As Barb pointed out, and you go into this last year on the Ford, the volume on the Ford as we go through the test program and for all the excitement that is in the test program, what actually happens is the volume comes down, because as you complete certain piece of the ship, you do not need as many people on it. They have to move somewhere and they will be moving to CVN-79, so you can think of a ship construction. You can think of it as a bell curve that kind of goes over - I am talking just the construction piece of this, is a bell curve that goes over an eight-year period and we are in the last year of it, so the Ford is kind of going down that tail. The Kennedy, we are a couple of years into in to that. In the perfectly balanced world, this contract for the Kennedy would have been done a couple of years ago, right?
Robert Spingarn: Mike, does the EBIT follow the same curve given the fact that you retire risk towards the end of the Ford and then on the new one, you are going to book conservatively in the beginning?
Mike Petters: Yes. It does not follow that same curve, because the risk retirement is usually in the second half of the program.
Robert Spingarn: Right. That is what I am getting at here. There is a point, there is a different EBIT curve and so what I am trying to understand is over the next couple of years the profitability of new build carrier, how does that trend?
Barb Niland: Well, I think you have to look at total Newport News and we will stick to the 9%, but I will tell you in terms of the volume that you are talking about, so in 2015 you have the volume of CVN-78, plus you have the volume of CVN-79 construction planning, so and if you remember that was like $3.3 billion of awards of that contract, so we have been doing a lot of work on that. When CVN-78 leaves, you will only have CVN-79, unless, and I do not think this it is going to happen in 2016, but unless they start CP on 80, you are going to have a little bit of volume mix and VCS going full-fledged into two subs years pick up a little bit of that.
Robert Spingarn: Okay.
Mike Petters: Let us now go back to what we have been saying for four years and Newport News is a healthy shipyard. A healthy shipyard should be able to operate in 9% to 10% range, notwithstanding all of the different mixes and blends and moving parts that happened in there, we fully expect that our core Shipbuilding business for over any horizon will be operating in that range.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mike Petters for any closing remarks.
Mike Petters: Well, thanks for joining us today and thanks for your interest in our company. Just to kind of summarize where we are today, I am very pleased with where we are as a company. We are continuing as we have talked about. We are continuing to invest in our core business as that is the engine that drives the success of this company in total. We will continue to bring our shareholders along. We have been doing that and we will continue to do that and we expect to do that in the future and we will continue to look for ways to create long-term sustainable value, new value for the customers that we have and the customers that could not take advantage of our capabilities, so I am very excited about the company that we are building here today. Our capabilities and our channels that we have today put us in a much stronger position than we were four years ago when we first spun out and became a public company, we really appreciate your interest in what we are doing and we look forward to seeing you. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does concludes the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.

As you all know, Joe was insightful, accurate and fair and he had a keen understanding of our business and our industry and he will be sorely missed. This morning we released fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results that reflect excellent operating margin performance and cash generation at Ingalls and Newport News. We also had some pressure from UniversalPegasus due to extremely dynamic market conditions and some operational challenges. I want to personally thank each one of the 38,000 employees of Huntington Ingalls for the hard work and dedication that produced these results and for their continuous commitment to safety, quality, cost and schedule. During the quarter we had two events that reduced our GAAP earnings. First, we absorbed the $37 million one-time cost to refinance our seven year notes which will significantly reduce our interest costs going forward. Second, our annual goodwill evaluation led to a $47 million non-cash impairment charge in our other segment. This was driven by the recent drop in oil prices and the decline in industry market multiples. In addition, fourth quarter 2013 sales and operating income at Ingalls included the benefits of the favorable resolution of hurricane related insurance claims. 2013 full year results also included the charge for closure of the Gulfport facility. All comparative data that Barb and I discuss today are adjusted for these items as well as for the FAS/CAS adjustment. For the quarter, sales of $1.9 billion were consistent with last year and segment operating margin was 9.4%, up from 7.9% last year. For the full year, sales of $7 billion were 2% higher than 2013 and segment operating margin of 9.1% was up from 7.6% in 2013. Diluted EPS was $2.19 for the quarter, up from $1.66 last year. Diluted EPS for the full year was $7.14 up from $5.36 last year. Additionally, we received $500 million in new contract awards during the quarter resulting in a backlog of $21 billion of which $12 billion is funded. Cash generation was particularly strong and we ended the year with approximately $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Now since our Q3 earnings call in November, the FY ‘15 budget has been authorized and appropriated and the President's proposed FY ‘16 budget has been released. Within the FY ‘15 budget, the Navy has decided to move forward with the refueling and complex overhaul of the George Washington, CVN 73. As a result, Newport News was recently awarded a $224 million contract modification for advanced planning of the RCOH, as well as for the procurement of long lead materials and this will support award of a contract for execution of the RCOH in the summer of 2017. Also within the FY ‘15 budget, an additional $1 billion was authorized and appropriated to support construction of the 12th LPD, LPD 28. In addition, $550 million is proposed in the President's FY ‘16 budget, bringing total potential funding to approximately $1.8 billion. Clearly there is broad support for the Navy/Marine Corps team and the critical industrial base that is required to support it. However, the cloud of sequestration remains on the horizon and Congress and the administration have difficult decisions to make in the near future in order to restore normal order to the process. Now I will provide a few points of interest on our major programs, beginning with Ingalls. The LPD and NSC programs are performing very well and are continuing to reap the benefits of serial production. I appreciate the progress made in securing funding for LPD 28, but our team will not rest until that ship is under contract. In the LHA program, LHA 7 Tripoli is continuing through the early phases of construction and is leveraging the lessons learned from LHA 6 America. In addition, efforts continue on the affordability design contract to reduce the construction and lifecycle cost of LHA 8. On the DDG 51 program, DDG 114 Ralph Johnson is preparing for launch late this year and work on the other ships remains on track. Regarding our Gulfport facility, Ingalls and the Mississippi State Port Authority entered into a purchase agreement in January of this year. The agreement allows the port to begin a due diligence process that may lead to the ultimate sale of the property. And now turning to Newport News, on CVN 78 Ford, the test program on this first of a class ship is still going well and delivery remains on track for the first half of 2016. For CVN 79 Kennedy, activities under the construction preparation contract are progressing very well and we expect a detailed design and construction contract to be awarded in the first half of this year. In submarines, our fifth delivery of the Virginia-class SSN 785 John Warner is preparing for sea trials and delivery in the second quarter of this year, while work on the remaining Virginia-class boats remains on track. CVN 72 Lincoln remains on track for redelivery to the Navy in the fourth quarter of next year and the inactivation and defueling work on CVN 65 Enterprise is ongoing. Last month we announced that the S. M. Stoller Corporation and Newport News Nuclear joined together to form Stoller Newport News Nuclear Incorporated or SN3. This entity combines the strength and experience of both companies to form a highly capable, full-service nuclear operations and environmental services company, focused on U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Department of Defense clients. We are very excited about the opportunities SN3 can pursue and capture in this space by leveraging our core competencies in nuclear operations, heavy manufacturing and engineering and program management. In addition, we recently acquired the Columbia Group's Engineering Solutions Division which supports our growth into the U.S. Navy unmanned submersibles market. ESD which was renamed Undersea Solutions Group, will report under the submarine program at Newport News. As I mentioned earlier, our other segment recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $47 million in the quarter, as a result of the recent drop in oil prices and its impact on current and future business. To address these factors as well as some of the operational challenges, we are taking specific actions, including changes in the management team, workforce reductions, consolidation of office space and other overhead cost reduction initiatives to right size our operations for this changing environment. With our eye always on long-term value creation, we are taking the necessary steps now to create a healthier business during this downturn in order to position UPI for long-term success when the market turns. In closing, I want to recap some of the things our team accomplished in 2014. We delivered LHA 6, the last of the underperforming ship contracts. Ingalls and Newport News generated segment operating margin above 9%. Operating and free cash flow were the highest since the spinoff in 2011 and we were awarded $10 billion in new contracts, including the Virginia-class Block IV and continued construction preparation for CVN 79 John F. Kennedy. We positioned ourselves in the energy market with the acquisitions of Stoller and UPI and also in the unmanned submersibles market with the reasonable closing of the Undersea Solutions Group acquisition. Looking ahead, we expect that there will be competitive or sole-source Navy shipbuilding contract awards of approximately $40 billion for Ingalls and Newport News in the next five years. These contracts are expected to lead to approximately $60 billion of follow-on work over the next 20 years. We will be making discretionary capital investments at both facilities in order to prosecute this work. Further, the Department of Energy will be recompeting over $66 billion of work in the next 10 years and we expect SN3 to be well-positioned to capture a share of those market opportunities. And finally, UPI will emerge from the downturn in the oil and gas market as a stronger, healthier business, well-positioned for the inevitable rebound in that market. With all that being said, I remain very confident in our ability to achieve 9%-plus operating margin in 2015. With our focus on creating long-term sustainable value, HII is positioned for a long and prosperous future. That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb.
Barb Niland: Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Today I'm going to review our consolidated and segment results for the fourth quarter and full year, then wrap up with some information on our outlook for 2015. Please refer to the slides posted on our website for more information. As Mike mentioned, all of the numbers that I discuss today will be adjusted for the goodwill impairment charge and the one-time interest expense for the early extinguishment of debt in 2014 and for 2013, the hurricane insurance recoveries and Gulfport closure. Please refer to the presentation on our website or the earnings release from this morning for the respective reconciliations. Now turning to the consolidated results shown on pages 4 and 5 of the presentation, we ended the year with very strong operational performance in the fourth quarter at Ingalls and Newport News. Total revenue in the quarter of $1.93 billion increased 1% over the same period in 2013, bringing 2014 revenue to just under $7 billion. Total operating income in the quarter was $191 million and the operating margin was 9.9%, compared to $156 million and 8.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. These increases were due primarily to higher operating income at Ingalls and Newport News, as well as favorable variants in the FAS/CAS adjustment which was partially offset by lower deferred state income taxes and an operating loss in the other segment. Cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were very strong in the quarter and for the full year. We generated $402 million of cash from operating activities in the quarter and $716 million for the full year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $328 million and $551 million for the full year. These increases were primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable and lower pension contributions. Changes in trade working capital were a source of cash in 2014 of $120 million. However, working capital continues to be weighed down by the closure costs of Gulfport and the Avondale facilities. As I mentioned before, we estimate the closure cost for Avondale at $284 million, of which $212 million is capitalized in inventory. The estimated closure for Gulfport is $57 million, of which $37 million is in accounts receivable. We continue to work with the Navy to reach final agreements on the treatment of these costs and we also hope to reach final agreement in the first quarter with the Mississippi State Port Authority on the sale of the Gulfport facility which will help alleviate some of the burden in working capital. Capital expenditures were $74 million in the quarter and $165 million for the full year which were in line with the expectations. In 2014, our cash contribution to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans was $159 million. Our actual return on assets was 10.1% and discount rates fell over 90 basis points to 4.34% at the end of the year. After a review and comparison of the new mortality tables to our actual experience, the updated mortality assumptions increased our pension liability by roughly 1% which equates to less than $60 million. We repurchased over 271,000 shares during the quarter at a cost of $26 million, bringing the total number of shares repurchased in the year to over 1.4 million at a cost of $138 million. In the quarter, we also paid dividends of $0.40 per share or $19 million, bringing the total dividends paid in 2014 to $49 million. Interest expense in the quarter was $66 million and $149 million for the full year. This included $37 million of one-time expense for early extinguishment of debt. Excluding this one-time expense, interest expense was also in line with our expectations. Our effective federal income tax rate in the quarter was 34.2% and 33.3% for the full year. Moving on to segment results on pages 6 and 7, revenues at Ingalls of $608 million declined 13.5% from the fourth quarter of 2013, due primarily to the deliveries of LHA 6, LPD 25, NSC 4 and the DDG 1001 Deckhouse. The decrease was tempered by increased volumes on the NSC and DDG programs. Operating margin in the quarter was 11.8%, up 530 basis points, driven by performance improvement and risk retirement on the LPD program. For the full year, Ingalls generated operating margin of 10% on revenues of $2.3 billion. Operating margin increased 518 basis points over 2013, primarily due to performance improvements and risk retirement on both the LPD and the NFC programs. Turning to page 8, revenue at Newport News increased 4.8% to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher volumes on the VCS program and the acquisition of S.M. Stoller. Operating margin in the quarter of 9.2% increased 47 basis points over the fourth quarter in 2013, due to performance improvement and higher risk retirement on the VCS program. For the full year, Newport News generated revenues of $4.5 billion, a 3.5% increase over 2013 and operating margin of 9.1% for the full year was consistent with 2013. Now to the other segment, revenues in the quarter were $56 million, bringing 2014 revenues to $137 million. The segment had an operating loss of $54 million in the quarter which included $47 million noncash goodwill impairment charge as a result of the recent drop in oil prices. Excluding the goodwill impairment, the operating loss in the quarter was $7 million and $12 million for the year. The losses were driven primarily by lower volumes on existing contracts, contract delays and cancellations as oil prices drop during the quarter and the non-cash amortization of purchase intangibles. Turning to slide 9, I'll provide an update on our pension assumptions for 2015. We are expecting a favorable net FAS/CAS adjustment of $111 million for the year. This is based on higher CAS recovery, as we hold our long-term return on assets assumption of 7.5%. We expect 2015 CAS recovery to exceed our cash contribution for both the pension and postretirement benefit plans, due to the phase-in of Harmonization. Let me provide you some additional insight for 2015. We expect our normal sustaining and maintenance CapEx spend to be about 2% of revenues. In addition, as we prepare to compete for the new programs that Mike talked about that are up for bid over the next five years, we are looking at spending up to another 2.5% to 3% of revenues on discretionary CapEx. So in total, CapEx spend for 2015 could be in the range of 4.5% to 5% of revenue. As Mike mentioned, we remain on track to achieve our 9%-plus segment operating margin goal. As a reminder, this is a full year objective and the quarters can sometimes be lumpy due to timing of risk retirement events. We expect deferred state income taxes to be a benefit of about $20 million, interest expense of approximately $100 million and the income tax rate in the 33% to 34% range. That wraps up my remarks and with that, I'll turn the call over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open. 
George Shapiro: Question on -- Mike you say margins will be over 9% but effectively Ingalls in Newport News made 9.4% this year. So are you figuring you'll see a decline in that margin in '15? If you could explain that a little bit further.
Mike Petters: As we said many times here George, the healthy business operates in the 9% to 10% range based on the blend and mix and the maturity of the work that we have going on. We had a great year in retiring risk in 2014. We have to do that again. At Newport News we have a lot of cost type work and we’re doing the delivery of the Ford. Most of that work will be done this year as we get ready for delivery next year. We’re going to be heading down the path of delivery of the RCOH and a lot of that work is going to be done this year and the enterprise also. We have three carriers in a cost type environment at Newport News that is going to make it -- it's a little bit out of balance in terms of the blended rate, so we'll be working our way through this year at Newport News. At Ingalls, the question really is how does with future workflow to support the risk retirement that we have going on, whether it's LPD 28 or the next LHA. How does that work flow in fit into our work? And so that's why we're not going to try to handicap whether it's higher or lower than 9.4%. We're just going to continue to say that to be healthy in this business you ought to be able to operate sustainably in the 9% to 10% range.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn: Barb, I wanted to come back to what you just said on CapEx and your comments on working capital and just see if we can get to the endgame on free cash flow for '15. So CapEx could go up by a couple hundred million, it sounds like. Assuming and I guess one question would be is that already in the plan or is that dependent on which programs you decide to pursue so how much variability is in that or do we just build in call it 4.5% to 5%. And then how does working capital behave? You obviously had that big drop in receivables. And that was -- is that going to be a headwind going into next year? Because if you take that and you take the CapEx it seems like free cash could be $300 million lower but I want to make sure I'm not forgetting to put in the positives such as the sale of assets and etcetera.
Barb Niland: So let's start with capital. And that's exactly why I explained capital and split out the maintenance and sustainment pretty steady at 3%. The discretionary capital are individual projects based on engineering studies that prove out the concept can improve efficiencies and reduce future cost to help us be more competitive. So we're not releasing all that capital and giving everybody a blank check to move forward. We're releasing it incremental and engineering studies to look at the items and determine if they make sense for us. Okay. So in a perfect world if all the projects that everybody wanted to do this year -- the range would be in that total capital 4.5% to 5% range right? At each project will be let out incrementally. And each quarter I'll let you know if I'm getting closer to that amount or not. So that covers the capital. On the working capital side we continue to work on working capital and yes -- we’re successful in the sale of Gulfport that will help a little bit but we assumed in some of what is in receivables today that we would sell Gulfport. So it will depend on the exact value we sell it for whether we will see an improvement due to that sale. And then the other thing we will be timing of completing the negotiations with the customer on that accelerated depreciation that's sitting in accounts receivable right now. So I believe though we have made a great effort to sell the property for -- and that the customer should recognize that and negotiations on that particular issue should go okay and move forward quickly once we get that sale complete. On the Avondale restructuring piece, remember we just recovered that over five years. So part of that would be recovered. And then since you're worried about what cash is going to be at the end of the year I would say 2014 we had an outstanding collections. We pretty much collected every single invoice we had outstanding, that's my first time in 10 years I've seen that. So it can be lumpy just because of timing. We might get paid January 2nd versus December 29th. So it's really tough to predict what it will end up at the end of the year.
Robert Spingarn: So just to close this off, you had a source of $100 million from working capital in '14, it's been a use in a couple of years prior to that, what's the right way to think -- I know they are moving pieces. Is there a good range we should use for '15?
Barb Niland: I think it's going to be tough to call on that one. My famous word lumpy it could be. It could be the same as 2014. It could be worse. So I promise you my entire team is working that every day. We have a relentless focus on improving working capital in this business.
Mike Petters: And Rob, if I could just pile on here, I know you didn't quite as this question but if you think about what's going to happen on the Navy business in the next five years and just take a look at the programs that are going to be awarded and then the tail that comes with those programs CVN-79 the construction contract, the CVN-73 RCOH, CVN 74 RCOH, the next block of submarines. The Ohio replacement program, LHA 8 and a whatever might come after LHA 8, the LPD 28 and the LXR program, a competition on the DDG program again. Whatever the Navy pass, whatever they chose for some future small surface combat is out there. You see an awful lot of activity not just in awards in the next five years but in terms of programs that are going to go out for 20 to 25 years are going to be decided here in the next five years and so our decision is that we want to invest against that to make sure that our competitive posture is where it needs to be. The Navy has got pressures on the budget side of this and so in some programs where we’re sole-source, our competition is with the budget and not necessarily with someone else and so our investment here is going to be about driving the efficiency into the business that our customer needs. In a way that will be sustainable, will create sustainable value for us longer than a year or two but really talking about a 20 to 25 year kind of return.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
Doug Harned: You mentioned Ohio class replacement and right now I mean that's a General Dynamics program but as you look forward to the opportunity to participate in that, what are the points in which the Navy or sort of the timing when the Navy would typically make a decision with respect to sharing work across different parts of the industry. In other words when could you start to see you might be playing a role in that?
Mike Petters: Well Doug I think first of all we've been doing some work on that program already, but as I've said before I think the way you have to think about that program. It is a major national construction effort and the entire submarine industrial base will be involved in trying to produce that program at the same time that it's still producing the Virginia class program. You'll have to ask the Navy on what their timing for their decisions on different pieces of this will be. But our expectation is that there will be a whole lot of discussions going forward about what's the most optimal way for the submarine industrial base at the national submarine base to produce the nation's demand for submarines. And so we expect that that will be played out over the next couple of years.
Doug Harned: And then I guess separately we've had this fall in oil prices. I think it's fair to say the oilfield services sector looks much less attractive than it did six months ago. How are you now looking at your efforts? You bought UniversalPegasus, as you go forward how do you think about that sector now given the change?
Mike Petters: Well there is no doubt that there has been a major change in that space from where we were a year ago. Our challenge today is to manage the reduced flow of capital. We see companies in that space that are delaying their projects. For the most part projects are not been canceled. We have really good customers that are working with us on delaying these projects to match their capital expenditures. They're changing their CapEx based on the oil price. The challenge for us is that there is definitely going to be less volume. We have got a size of the business to be successful at a lower volume. We have got to do that in an environment where we maintain the relationships that we have with these -- we have a superior group of customers and we're very proud of that customer set. We've got to maintain that relationship that we have with them. We bring to those customers some unique skills today and it's very important for us that we preserve and maintain those capabilities going forward because when this market terms and I believe it's inevitable that it will just don't ask me when. When it turns we are going to be positioned to benefit from that and the first order of business is we've got to be successful at a lower volume. Now as far as going forward and how you think about investing in that space, certainly growth rates have changed from where they were a year ago. A little bit different way to think about how do you value something in that space and so we're giving all of that another view. Certainly our view of the space has changed since where we were a year ago. But the bottom line Doug is that if we have a lot of capability and we’re interested in creating channels to those customers who need our capabilities and we think that that's a way to create new value for our business that wasn't there before.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
Pete Skibitski: Mike one for you. For the '15 budget approved, we've got the 16 proposal out there. A lot of shipped things seem to be clarifying a bit. I want to ask you, as your kind of midterm revenue profile kind of clarified at all or is there still kind of too much floating out there in terms of the unknown with sequestration and whatnot?
Mike Petters: I think the sequestration is the elephant in the room, frankly. I'm an optimist and I believe that somehow someway we will find a way to move into 2016 in a non-sequestered way. I can't tell you what the mechanism for that will be and I don't know what the catalyst for it is. But I do think that somehow this great country will find a way to do that because the alternative is just so bad. Relative to our specific programs, sequestration is -- in the midterm is a real challenge because when you start to look at some of the programs that I talked about over the next five years sequestration will directly affect some of those programs. I think the Navy has provided their list of how -- which programs get affected and by what volumes. The carrier program gets affected. The RCOH has been playing out on the front pages for the last couple of years. And I don't think that changes even though we have this contract now and we're racing towards an RCOH I think if we're in a sequestered environment I think that all gets debated again. And so I'm not sure that I would say that it's all cleared up. I think that I'm optimistic that we will find a way through it but there is still a lot of moving parts.
Pete Skibitski: And then just one follow-up, one thing I saw during the quarter is this idea of the Navy I think assembling plan where it was kind of compete altogether the fast oil or and LRX and I think maybe LHA-8 as well. And I was pretty confused about it in terms of what would a winning scenario look for HII and get a timeline during which this plays out. Can you add any light on that whole plan? And how it might play out for you guys?
Mike Petters: We’re at the very front end of the Navy's acquisition strategy for a range of programs and I think that that like a lot of things if you look at it before the cake is done sometimes that affects the cake. So I'm not going to comment too much on this except to say we're engaged with the Navy to figure how is the best way for them to successfully acquire the platforms that they need going forward.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open. 
Unidentified Analyst: It's actually Jon [inaudible] for Jason. I just want to confirm Mike, your language and you always say 9% plus margins in 2015. Is that still just a shipbuilding number or do you see some opportunity to turn other around a little bit faster with the cost actions you outlined?
Mike Petters: We think about that and we use that to set the stage four years ago for driving efficiency in our shipbuilding business. Over the long-term where we really want to be is we want to be driving the return on invested capital in our business up and we’re making some big investments right now and so that’s going to be, we’re still kind of going to be going through this phase is that return on sales or segment margin or is it return on invested capital? I think about that in terms of specifically I think about shipyards in being -- a healthy shipbuilding business operates in that 9% to 10% range. Relative to other segment that we’re talking about today, as I said we expect that to be successful at a lower volume and that's what our efforts going to be. Overall I think we still be in the 9% to 10% range.
Barb Niland: The other segment in a healthy business, remember it's a services business so it's in the 5% to 7% range, okay, with no capital investment. And then in the shipbuilding side where Mike talked about the healthy range of 9% to 10%, what you have to remember is we have services also in the shipbuilding side with our businesses and AMSEC and continental maritime that are -- we’re absorbing it at a much lower margin rate because those contracts are all time and material or cost plus with much lower margin rates. So it's all about being a healthy business and having a good mix of programs.
Unidentified Analyst: Just a quick follow-up on segments, Mike I think in reference in response to George mentioned some mix shift headwinds at Newport News. Similar question at Ingalls, it sounds like you -- feel like you have opportunity to potentially repeat what you did this year even though fourth quarter was so strong. Could you add a little more on Ingalls sustainability going forward?
Mike Petters: Where we are at Ingalls is the execution side of Ingalls is going very well right now. Across all other programs that I went through and our comments -- I'm very, very happy with the way that we are executing. But part of being the healthy shipyard is that you have to bring in the future work to balance the volume. And so -- how does the Navy acquire the platforms and how does Ingalls participate in those acquisitions over the next few years is part of the equation as to whether they can be sustainable or not. And so really four years ago the focus at Ingalls was on execution. Today the focus at Ingalls -- it always remains on execution but we then have to use our performance to make sure that we preserve and capture the work that's in front of us. And so that's what our effort is. If that work starts to move around even though we will be executing well it will drive our rates and that will negatively affect the business. So our overall approach is to let's get this work done. That's why we're particularly pleased with where the LPD 28 came out. The Congress step forward and put a $1 billion up against that program and the Navy came back in the '16 budget and added more money to the program and basically now there is a commitment to go and execute that program. We think that that is the right decision but it also is very, very helpful to Ingalls around the sustainability of their future.
Barb Niland: And John, I would like to add when you -- Jason I'm sorry, when you talked about the fourth quarter being pretty big at Ingalls. It was because we launched LPD 26 and as we go into 2015 we will have the launch of NSC-6 and the launch of one of the DDGs. And much smaller ships so we had big risk retirement on 26 that affected the fourth quarter. And the risk retirement on a smaller ship will be a little different next year or this year, as we are in this year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open. 
George Shapiro: Yes, I just wanted to clarify some of your earlier comments, Barb. So based on the higher CapEx and receivables being flat it doesn't seem like you could get free cash flow equal to net income in '15. It's going to be somewhat below. Is that a fair statement?
Barb Niland: It could be. Yes. That's a fair statement.
George Shapiro: Okay and then just if you could comment, could you project what CAS might be for '16 at this point?
Barb Niland: I don't have that crystal ball here. Of course we have projections where we think they'll be but -- George, I hate to go out on a limb on that one, but thanks for asking me.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
Doug Harned: Just one more question, when you talk about 4.5% to 5% CapEx -- I found this a little surprising and the reason is it seems that in many ways that you've moved from a situation of going into new programs to a more steady -- it what appears to be a more steady-state of similar ships going forward. So I was surprised to see CapEx go up to these levels. If you look at say GD Marine Systems they've operated pretty consistently between 1% and 2% for CapEx for some time. I'm just trying to understand what's different at Huntington Ingalls right now and -- where this -- what is this going to basically, the CapEx?
Mike Petters: The perspective that we have is that we've taken advantage of the serial production in the LPD program and the restart of the destroyer program. And the lessons learned on the LHA's. We've taken advantage of that to fix the returns on our Ingalls business. And we look out ahead and we see the LXR program out there which is a new program, we see the next competition for the destroyers which will be -- that's coming up in about three years. We see the next -- we see LHA-8 is under some significant budget pressure at this point and we see the question is what happens after LHA-8 out there. We see the need to reset the competitive posture at Ingalls and so that's our objective here is to first of all reset that from a capital investment perspective and the facilities perspective, I’ve been working on process for quite a while but it's time for us to go and align the facility and our process there to be even more competitive. I think the one way to think about that Doug is that we’re building multiple classes of ships in the shipyards, in each of our shipyards and so we’re building facilities that tend to be multi-platform flexible which makes it a little bit different kind of investment profile than say other folks might have. At Newport News there is a lot of budget pressure as you well know in the carrier program there is a cost cap on CVN-79, the challenge of getting to a contract. I mean we've been working on trying to get to a contract for quite a while. How do you invest in the process efficiencies they are going to allow that to happen? I do think that there will be -- as a submarine industrial base tries to figure out how to support the Virginia class and Ohio replacement programs at the same time, there is going to be need for capital investment at Newport News to support that. And we stand ready to go make those investments. And I think when you step back and look at capital investment in the shipbuilding space overall we tend to think of capital is something that's going to play out over the next 3 to 5 years but in fact the capital investment that we make today will be generational. I kind of think of this -- this may be a little bit more like the investment that a drug company makes before they bring a drug to the market. We make a big investment in the space and then we go and we use that to capture the programs and then we drive the serial production in the programs to capture the returns that we need. And so that's kind of where the phase is and if you look as I've gone through the list of the things that the Navy is going to be settling in the next five years this is the time for us to go and reset the competitive posture of our shipbuilding business.
Doug Harned: So is it fair to say when I look at Ingalls for example you had post-Katrina there was a lot of work down there to modernize those shipyards at that point in time. When you look at today's situation, I think of Ingalls -- LXR is still a few years you know particularly with LPD-28 assuming that all goes according to plan. Do you invest this early for an LXR are you investing specifically for a LXR program or specifically for Ohio class replacement at this point in time or are these things that you do to modernize the shipyard to make you better positioned for each of those?
Mike Petters: I think Doug that's great insight and I think that that's some of both. First of all in the aftermath of Katrina what we did is we rebuilt the shipyard. I can't say that we actually modernize the shipyard in the sense of bringing it to where the state-of-the-art is in terms of shipbuilding production. We were changing the team that was there was changing the wheel on a car that was going around a curve at 60 miles an hour and a lot of what was done was just rebuilding what we already had. This is a much different thought process on what is the process that we're going to use for building ships? Some of the investment that we’re going to make are going to be generic in nature that will support all of our ship building programs. Some of them will be conditional based on the Navy's plan for acquisition and you bring up the timing of the program that may certainly affect the timing of some of our investments. But all in all our overall approach here is there is so much in play over the next 3 to 5 years that has such a long impact on the business that we want to be out in front of that.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
Pete Skibitski : I have a couple more free cash questions, actually. Bob I think just so I'm clear on 2014 you had a pretty large retention release on LHA-6 correct?
Barb Niland: That’s correct.
Pete Skibitski: We don't have anything similarly that could happen in 2015?
Barb Niland: No you do not have anything that will offset that.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. And just an housekeeping D&A I think came in at close to $195 million. Should we expect that up by any meaningful amount because of the CapEx ramp or will that impact more over time?
Barb Niland: That will have an impact more over time.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. And then last one I guess on the debt refinancing I think you have one more kind of high rate trend, the 7 and 8 they are doing 20-21?
Barb Niland: You got it.
Pete Skibitski: Any chance that you would refinance those sooner before maturity?
Barb Niland: If we can get a good rate and the time is right it would be the smart thing to do. So we always look at it and when the numbers balance and the MPB is that the right rate we certainly will jump in if we have the opportunity.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Sam Pearlstein: I wanted to ask you a question about some of the budget stuff in the fiscal '16 request. Just if I look at like CVN-78 it looked like it was a little bit less by few hundred million in '16 then you would've said in from the set up last year and I guess I'm trying to just think about, is that a sign of more spending in '15? Or is that a stretch out of development and does it have any impact in terms of the Kennedy or the next negotiation?
Mike Petters: I think sometimes you need a program to try to decipher what you read in the budget documents. We're in a place where we are moving towards completion on CVN-78 and the program is funded. How the government is trying to do their housekeeping to make sure that they have the funding to get us to the end point, we're aware of that but that's really an internal to the government kind of discussion. We have the authorities, the processes, the people and the decisions to make to get the ship delivered and that's what we're really focused on. On CVN-79 we've been doing significant work on a construction preparation contract. We have been negotiating the detailed design and construction contract. We have talked for a while about the challenge of negotiating a price type contract when you're not finished yet with the first one which was in a cost type environment. And so we are still trying to work our way through that and get some common view of what's the risk in that program and make sure the government and the company have a view of the risk that looks the same. Overlying that whole negotiation though really is the cost cap on CVN-79 which is a number that was set equivalent to the cost cap on CVN-78 back in 2006 or so something like that. And so trying to figure out how do you get all the scope, how do you get the risk agreed to and how do you do that inside the box that the government is operating inside has made for a really challenging negotiation. As far as the funding goes and the way the budget request and the appropriations and the way the Navy is thinking about that -- we're pretty very confident that all the authority and funding that we need to get these ships done is in place.
Sam Pearlstein: And is that the same on the George Washington in terms of the overall? I know there is funding in this budget request but are you working I guess towards the dismantling step and then you still have to wait for the next contract to actually do the remainder of the refueling?
Mike Petters: No what's happened here is we actually now have a contract to plan for the refueling. The contract mod that we just did cuts us loose to go and plan the work as if it's a refueling and to actually begin the procurement of long lead material to do that. What will be hanging over that is that there will be an execution contract to follow and the execution contract could be affected by whether or not we're in a sequestered environment. And so that's sort of the grey area out there. As I said I'm an optimist, I believe that we will find a path through there, I believe that ship will be refueled. I believe that we will get to the 79 under contract. I believe that these programs will stay on track and the timing will all be in place. But I don't know what the catalyst for removal of sequestration is, yet. So we'll see.
Operator: Thank you. And I do have a question from Jason Gursky with Citi.
Unidentified Analyst: It's [inaudible] again. Thanks so much for fitting me in on the follow-up. If you guys just [inaudible] a little more on the timeline perhaps of how long it will take to "reset" your competitive posture and then especially in this environment of heightened CapEx, what is the cash to point priorities specifically on returning cash to shareholders? Could we see share count come down? Do expect the low rates of dividend? Just what does that fall in this list of priorities you've offered today?
Mike Petters: Well we certainly believe strongly in bringing our shareholders along with us as we go forward. I believe that our shareholders understand that we need to go and be successful in this resetting of the business and so we see that being pretty balanced going forward. This is not something that we will do at the expense of the shareholders. This will be done with them in partnership with us.
Mike Petters: Okay. Thanks everybody for joining us today. I'd like to wrap things up by just saying how pleased I'm with where we are right now. Looking back over the past four years we have absolutely turned around the performance at Ingalls and we have maintained Newport News performance at the levels that you expect. In spite of our challenges at UPI we have produced the operating margin in cash at levels right in-line with our expectations. We have a clear view of the things we need to do to maintain a strong and competitive business for the long-term. Our relentless focus on execution will never change. We do recognize the importance of finding new paths to create additional value and we absolutely plan to bring our shareholders along with us. So thanks for your interest in HII and we look forward to seeing you soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Q3 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dwayne Blake. Sir, you may begin.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thanks, Vince. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barb Niland, Corporate Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements, and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law, actual results may differ.

We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations to view the presentation as well as our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
C. Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, we released third quarter 2014 financial results that continue to reflect strong operating margin performance and cash generation, which are right in line with our expectations. Before I discuss the current results, as a reminder, in the third quarter last year, sales and operating income at Ingalls included a onetime charge for closing our Gulfport composite facility and a favorable resolution of hurricane-related insurance claims. So all comparative data that I discussed will adjust for these items. For the quarter, sales of $1.7 billion were up 3% from last year and segment operating margin was 8.8%, up from 6.8% last year. Operating margin at our Ingalls segment improved from 2.9% last year to 9.8%, while our Newport News segment continued to deliver solid performance at 9.2% for the quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.96 in the quarter, up significantly over last year. Additionally, we received $400 million in new contract awards during the quarter, resulting in backlog of $23 billion, of which $13 billion is funded. Now reflecting continued confidence in the performance of our programs and the ability to achieve our 2015 goal, our Board of Directors recently approved an increase in our dividend from $0.20 per share to $0.40 per share as well as an expansion of our share repurchase program from the most recent authority of $300 million to $600 million. Now these decisions reaffirm our commitment to continuing to return cash to our shareholders as a part of a balanced cash employment strategy. Since our quarter -- our second quarter earnings call in August, the Navy has decided to continue planning efforts for the Refueling and Complex Overhaul of the George Washington CVN-73 and is working to reallocate investment across the future year defense plan to fund the RCOH air wing, manpower and support. As we noted last quarter, Newport News was awarded a contract to begin planning of defueling work on George Washington as another positive step toward an anticipated contract for the full RCOH in fiscal year 2015. However, the scope of work for planning the defueling work is only a small portion of the full planning effort we need to be performing to prepare for the RCOH. With this in mind, we are concerned that continued delays in award of the RCOH planning and execution contracts as well as delay of the detailed design and construction contract for CVN-79, John F. Kennedy, it is creating pressure on our programs at Newport News. Regarding the LXR program, we have always advocated that the LPD is a platform with proven capability, flexibility and affordability and would be the best foundation for future amphibious ships. We also believe that construction of the 12th LPD-28, which has been supported by 3 of the 4 congressional defense committees in their fiscal year '15 markups, is a bridge to LXR. However, Congress still needs to decide if they will proceed and will also need to finalize how much funding allotted will be allotted in fiscal year 2015 for the construction of LPD-28. While all of these developments are positive, funding for the CVN-73 RCOH, LPD-28 construction and other ship building parties are still subject to final agreement in passage of the FY '15 defense appropriations bill. Now, I will hit a few highlights of our major programs, beginning with Ingalls. In the LPD program, LPD-26 John P. Murtha is over 80% complete and the team launched the ship last week, marking the transition from the unidirection phase to system integration and testing phase of construction, in support of sea trials and delivery in 2016. LPD-27 Portland is approximately 36% complete and is continuing to make steady progress through the shop and unit manufacturing phases of construction in preparation for launch next year. In the LHA program, LHA-7 Tripoli is in the early phases of construction and is using lessons learned from the LHA-6 America to ensure Tripoli is built with a focus on safety, quality, cost and schedule. In addition, efforts continue on the affordability design contract to reduce the construction in lifecycle cost of LHA-8. In the National Security Cutter program, NSC-4 Hamilton completed acceptance trials and was delivered to the Coast Guard in September. The shipbuilders working on this program are leveraging the benefit of serial productions to reduced cost and schedule from ship to ship. NSC-5 James is over 80% complete and is preparing for propulsion plant light-off in December. NSC-6 Munro had its keel-laying ceremony yesterday. Fabrication of NSC-7 Kimball is scheduled to begin in early 2015 and the purchase of long-lead-time materials for NSC-8 Midgett remains on track. On the DDG-51 program, DDG-113 John Finn is approximately 50% complete and remains on track to be delivered to the Navy in 2016. In addition, we authenticated the keel for DDG-114 Ralph Johnson and have started fabrication of DDG-117 Paul Ignatius. At Avondale, all units under construction for LPD-27 were complete at the end of October. Our joint study group with Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is ongoing. And as we have stated before, if an economically viable best use of a facility is determined, the companies may pursue the formation of a joint venture to redevelop the Avondale site. However, if we are unsuccessful in these efforts, we will proceed with our plan of record and close the facility. And now turning to Newport News. CVN-78 Ford is approximately 83% complete and continues through the final outfitting and test phases of construction, with delivery still on track for 2016. Thus far, we are pleased with the results of the test program on this first-class -- first of a class ship. We maintain a watchful eye on key metrics, such as compartment completion rates and man hour performance as leading indicators for issues that may impact our risk retirement plans. For CVN-79 Kennedy, engineering and design material procurement and advanced unit construction activities continue under the construction preparation contract, given the pressure that continued delays creates on our business space, we are hopeful that a detailed design and construction contract will be awarded late this year or earlier next year. In submarines, SSN-785 John Warner was christened in early September, kicking off a final outfitting, testing and crew certification phase of construction, prior sea trials and delivery next year. Work on the remaining Block III boats remains on track and long-lead-time material purchases and early manufacturing activities are underway on several Block IV boats. CVN-72 Lincoln undocked earlier this year and is transitioned to the reinstallation, outfitting and test phases of the RCOH. CVN-65 Enterprise continues to progress through its 38-month contract for the inactivation and the defueling of its 8 nuclear reactors. Regarding our recently established other segment, this marks the first full quarter of activity for UPI under HII, and integration activities are ongoing. We're also capturing operations from the reopening of our Waggaman engineering and construction facility in this segment. This is a small operation near the Avondale Shipyard that could ultimately support partnering or subcontracting to perform fabrication work for prime contractors in the oil and gas infrastructure market. We believe that as relationships in this space are expanded through our engineering efforts at UPI. Having a facility that can perform fabrication work positions us well for future opportunities that may arise. In closing, I am very pleased with the progress our team is making. We are maintaining a relentless focus on program execution, risk retirement and cash generation in order to continue creating value for all of our stakeholders. There is still a lot of work to do. But I am confident that this team is up to the challenge, and we will achieve our goal of 9-plus percent operating margin in 2015. That concludes my remarks. And I will turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financial. Barb?
Barbara A. Niland: Thanks, Mike. And good morning to everyone on the call. Today, I will review our consolidated and segment results. But before I do, I want to remind you of a few changes that we implemented in this year. First, we acquired S.M. Stoller in January, and the financial results are reported under our Newport News segment. Second, during the first quarter, we transferred AMSEC and CMSD businesses from our Ingalls segment to our Newport News segment. All 2013 financial results include this realignment between the segments. And third, we created our other segment during the second quarter to reflect the results of our newly acquired engineering and project management business, UPI. Finally, as Mike mentioned earlier, we had a couple adjustments in the third quarter last year. Sales at Ingalls were increased by $28 million and operating income was decreased by $29 million, reflecting the net impact of the settlement of the hurricane-related insurance claims and closure of the Gulfport composite facility. All of the numbers that I discussed today will be adjusted for these events and you can refer to the presentation on the website, or the earnings release for the reconciliation. Now let's turn to our consolidated financial results on Slide 4 of our presentation. We had a solid quarter with modest revenue growth and strong operating margin performance. Total revenue increased 3% in the quarter, primarily due to the 2 acquisitions we completed during the year, while our existing businesses remained relatively flat. Total operating income during the quarter was $171 million, an increase of 74% over the prior year, driven mostly by the [indiscernible] FAS/CAS adjustment and increased operating income at Ingalls. We had another strong quarter of cash generation. Cash from operations was $256 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $216 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $40 million compared to $30 million in the same period last year. To date, capital expenditures are lower than previously projected, and therefore, we expect 2014 to be between 2% and 2.5% of sales. Under our share repurchase program, we purchased approximately 71,000 shares at a cost of $7 million. We also paid our quarterly dividend of $0.20 in September of cost of $10 million, bringing our quarter end cash balance to $769 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.3%, up from 30.3% in the same period last year due to the favorable impact from the true-up of actual tax return to provisional taxes in the third quarter of last year. Moving to our segment results on Slide 5. Ingalls had slightly lower sales but significant operating income growth for the quarter. Revenue was down 6% in the quarter due to lower volumes on LHA-6 and LPD-25. Operating margin of 9.8% was up significantly over prior year, primarily due to performance improvements and risk retirement on the LPD program. Turning to Slide 6. Newport News revenues increased 2% in the quarter, driven by the Stoller acquisition, which contributed $29 million to revenue and higher volumes in submarines and engineering. Operating margin increased 26 basis points in the quarter to 9.2%, primarily due to higher risk retirement on the VCS program. Now moving to our other segment. Revenues in the quarter were $61 million with an operating loss of $5 million. The loss was driven by non-cash amortization of purchased intangibles and adjustments for the integration of our accounting processes and program risk methodology at UPI as well as absorption of additional startup costs for Waggaman engineering and construction facility. We expect that these items will continue to be a drag on the other segment financial results in the near term. Turning to pension. For the full year, we are estimating a FAS/CAS Adjustment of $76 million, which is lower than our previous guidance. This is due to updated demographic data and other items, which increased by both FAS expense and CAS cost for the year, and is unrelated to the extension of MAP-21, also known as the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. We were not impacted by HATFA because of the method we select in determining the interest rate under the regulations. The regulations permit to use of current market interest rates in determining cash cost. And therefore, we believe this methodology more closely aligns with the timing of our cash recoveries with our pension contribution. For sensitivity purposes, for 2014, at the end of the third quarter, our discount rates were approximately 60 basis points below last year. And year-to-date, actual returns were approximately 7%. In addition, we expect full year deferred tax income tax expense to be in the $3 million to $4 million, net interest expense to be approximately $110 million and the effective tax rate to be between 33% and 34%. As I said before, after we complete our pension remeasurement at the end of the year, we will provide 2015 pension assumptions and sensitivities during the fourth quarter call. That concludes my remarks on the quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thanks, Barb. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to 1 initial question and 1 follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Vince, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Spingarn of Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Barb, one for you, Mike one for you. I'll start with Barb on the margins. I just want to clarify the 9-plus for next year contemplates pension or not? In other words, is it a segment number or is it an EBIT number?
Barbara A. Niland: It was a segment number. And it contemplated pension before all the churn with the new mortality tables, and certainly, the discount rate and things like that. So what you have to remember is some of our cost is recovered in the contracts and then SEC CAC. So as we're going through and looking at all the changes, we'll provide guidance at the end of the fourth quarter on that.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then, Mike, higher levels, just following the election here, we're going to get center in McKean [ph], as Chairman of Sask [ph]. And he has had a lot of focus on the carrier program, LCS as well, which really isn't your issue. How do we think about potential delays on CVN-79? And is there at some point a revenue bridge -- possible revenue bridge issue?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. That's a good question. I mean, I think, the challenge for us is that -- what made us successful over the last few years has been our ability to really focus on the execution side of our business. And what you're poking at here is really what's the market risk as opposed to what's the program risk. We're going to be executing the final stages of the lead ship of the Ford-class. At the same time, that we're going to be coming through the contracting for the next ship, and we've been kind of working our way through that over the last couple of years. And the way that we've been bridging this has been with these construction preparation contracts. We really need to get to a detailed design and construction contract here. Because what will happen without that is, it will start to affect, as you point out, it'll start to affect the business base at Newport News, which then, in its own way, comes back and reflects on the program performance. So our view is, the sooner we can get to a regular order on the hill, the better things will be in terms of managing the market risk. And it's not just the carriers, I mean, it's going to be LPD-28 is in that mix, the George Washington RCOH is in that mix, LHA-8 is in that mix. All of those things are really crucial for us that we think will come through in the course of regular order process on the Hill that will mitigate that market risk that sits out there from beyond 2015. And so, we're encouraged that there are folks today talking about getting back to regular order. We've been a staunch advocate for that for quite some time. And we look forward to engaging in that process as it develops.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. So just to clarify, Mike. This is beyond '15. At this point, '15 is pretty well set?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think that a detailed design and construction contract on 79 would help '15. I mean, I'd say, no, there's no doubt about that, in terms of the base. I mean, at Newport News, if you look at '16, what's going to happen in '16 is, you're going to deliver the Ford, you're going to deliver the Washington, you're going to deliver the Enterprise. So there's 3 carrier deliveries in 2016. The follow-on work to those 3 jobs is the 79 and the 73. We really need to have those things sorted out now. We know the 73 contract is -- the start is being delayed by 6 or 7 months. And so that's part of the challenge that we have. But we need to get to 79 on the contract in a big way.
Operator: And our next question comes from Finbar Sheehy of Sanford Bernstein.
Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Looking at -- I know that you've got UniversalPegasus into the other segment, is that going to be managed separately? And what synergies are you looking at between that business, Newport News and Ingalls?
C. Michael Petters: Well, it's going to be -- it will be managed separately. And we have a great leadership team there in place that stayed with the company as we acquired it. The synergies that we're looking for are the back and forth between the engineers. We've already had some engineers from Ingalls support projects at UniversalPegasus where customers needed some specific skills that were resident in our shipbuilding business. I think the way to think about this is, the acquisition of UniversalPegasus opens a new channel for us to deploy capability that is pretty -- we have pretty strong capability here for shipbuilding, but that's only one channel. So the opportunity here is to use the bandwidth of UniversalPegasus with the depth of the shipbuilding talent, specifically, in engineering, to support projects and customers down the road.
Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I mean, the way -- when you say it that way, it suggests that you have, at least, for periods of time, engineers in the shipbuilding business that are not being fully utilized. Is that so or how did that happen?
C. Michael Petters: Yes, I know. I think the thing that gets lost in here is, the one thing that we are really good at in shipbuilding is we know how to develop a workforce. We are engaged in workforce development from the governors office in the states that we're in, all the way down to the deckplay through the community colleges, through all the high schools, through the colleges and universities. We know how to go do that. We know how to plan for workforce, where we have a great recruiting program, we have a great hiring program. Staffing is a challenge in the oil and gas space today. And we're bringing that competency for staffing. We're making that part of UniversalPegasus competencies now, which we think will help them, and it makes us a better owner of that business, because we bring that strength to them, and it gives them a chance to better support their customers. I don't have a single person who's sitting here on the bench and waiting to be called to go into the game. But if I know I need to send 2 people to Houston to take care of a project next week, I can manage that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Mike, a question for you on Avondale. Just a kind of update there, obviously, the exploratory work has gone on for quite a while with Kinder Morgan. And I wondered if there's a point at which a decision really needs to be made if there's a kind of critical decision point out there? And if that exploratory work has yielded anything, incrementally new or interesting from your perspective, since the last time we talked about this?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. I mean, we're still engaged and nothing really changed since the last time we talked about it. Lots of alternatives are being put on the table. Kinder Morgan is a great company with a wide aperture to that space with lots of creativity in terms of ways the facility might be utilized. And so the question is, what's the best way for it to be utilized and how do we bring that to fruition? So we'll continue to engage in that and we'll keep you posted.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right. And one for Barb. Just with respect to your comment around the CapEx. Is that a shift of capital spending into '15 from '14, relative to what you -- the 3% you would call out prior?
Barbara A. Niland: It is. It's just timing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Nadel of JPMorgan.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's actually Chris on for Joe. Just a follow-up on the Avondale question, the financial implications, can you to start to recover the human capital piece now that than naval work is done? Or do you have to wait for the completion of the Kinder Morgan study?
Barbara A. Niland: We're working on that. That's really a negotiation with our customer, but that really is what we'd like to do, if we believe the Kinder Morgan, there's an opportunity there with them.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And it sounds like at this point, there's no finite end date for the Kinder Morgan study, is that right?
Barbara A. Niland: We were hoping to have a decision by the end of the year, that may extend a little bit.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then, Mike, one for you on the broader strategy, and you're pretty close to achieving initial goals you set out for the company, and you're now entering a period with cash flow to get much better. You've clearly showed your interest in entering adjacencies through the acquisition, but how do you think about the right capital appointment next going forward between more acquisitions or more and more return of cash to shareholders?
C. Michael Petters: Well, we've continued to say from the beginning that we expect to have a balanced cash deployment strategy. And I think so far, we've demonstrated that, that's what we're thinking. And is the way you see it playing out as the way we expect it to continue to play out. I do believe that in the next couple of years, you're going to see, we're going to need to make some investments in our Navy business. And that's to support future programs that are coming on and also to retire some of the risks that we see in programs that are about to kick off. So we're investing in our own business, investing in adjacent business, returning cash to shareholders, we're going to keep that all in pretty good balance. We think that's the best way to create value for this business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: It's actually Jon for Jason. I was wondering, can you guys breakout if there was anything to quantify in terms of margin adjustment at Ingalls, what the benefit was on the LPD adjustment? And then on a related note, where do we go from here? Is empty Avondale dragging you down at all? And then the 9% margin of commentary in 2015, is that just for the ships business or are you -- can you quantify that event with everything including other?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay. So on that, adjustment at Ingalls, we don't really break it down by ship or anything. So it's a combination of risk retirement on LPD-26 as well as continuing to perform better on the deferred work on the delivered ships. So that's really what that was. And in terms of the margin, the 9% is really based on the shipbuilding business, as I talked in the last call, the other segment is a services business and will have lower margins than our Navy shipbuilding business.
C. Michael Petters: Yes. We actually -- the way we're thinking about this is that, if you recall 3.5 years ago, establishing the 9% target was a way for us to drive the efficiencies that we needed to create in our shipbuilding business, for that kind of business. But we expect to move this business forward as -- with an eye towards creating value, a lot more along the lines of return on investment, and return on invested capital. And so the engineering services business doesn't typically require a lot of capital investment and so the actual return on sales can be a little bit different and still have an appropriate return on investment.
Jonathan Raviv: Okay, great. And then just one last one. When you guys pointed out, you talked about there being this nice working capital swing that we're seeing right now. Just clarifying your previous comments about some continued investment requirements, is that something new that AC is cropping up? Or is that just sort of steady-state requirements of the business?
Barbara A. Niland: It's a combination...
C. Michael Petters: Yes. It's a combination of both. I mean, if you look at the -- with the projects that the Navy is kind of putting on the table in front of us over the next 3 to 5 years, LHA-8, TAO-X, LXR future surface combatants or the small surface combatant, ORP and the continuing investment to reduce risk in the carrier construction and overhaul programs, you kind of see that we're entering a phase here where there's a lot of big programs that are going to be on the table that are in their upfront investment phase. And so, we're looking -- we're taking a look that to say what makes sense for us and how do we construct the way to engage in that across-the-board. So that's sort of the Navy investment that goes along with what we kind of typically do across the life of a program.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research: I wanted to pursue -- Mike, I mean, your goal is 9% margins next year, but effectively, I mean, you made over 9 just in the segment this quarter as well as last quarter. And while maybe pension income is somewhat less next year, you really extend[ph] with pension income and that which sounds like, Barb, you included that in the 9% number. So what do you think then gets worse the next years, is it the investments that you're just talking about, Mike? Because it sounds to me like 9% down from where you currently are?
C. Michael Petters: Well, obviously, George, we are very pleased with where we are. And if you go back to March of '11 and we have written down on an envelope that this is where we would be and we've sealed it up. We would have been very, very happy to take that envelope back in March of '11. But we continue to focus on 2015 because our work here is really, while we feel good, we haven't won this game yet. We're still retiring risk on the new contracts that we have at Ingalls. LPD-26 is going very well, as I mentioned, LPD-27 is going well. LHA-7 is off to a reasonable start, the restart of the destroyer programs are going well. But all of those programs, I'd say, all those programs, particularly, the destroyer programs and the LHA-7 are kind of at the beginning of their risk retirement profile. And so we have to keep our eye focused on that. We're not going to declare victory on that. And we need to follow on work to balance that out, to sustain it. So LPD-28 becomes crucial in terms of being able to sustain our business base and sustain that performance beyond 2015. At Newport News, as I mentioned, we're a little bit -- we're kind of entering a phase here where the balance shipyard that we've been talking about for 3.5 years, we maybe starting to get a little bit out of balance with the 3 carrier deliveries in '16, and the follow-on work is not yet contracted for. In addition, the large effort that it will take to deliver the Ford, there will be scheduled risk and there will be costs risk as we go through the lead ship delivery over the next year. And not being quite imbalanced there, may give us some lumpiness in the way that Newport News looks over the next year. So we're looking at all of that, and we're trying to make sure that, while we feel really good about where we are, we anticipated in 2011 that this is kind of a stuff that we would be facing in 2015. We want to make sure we keep our eyes on that ball.
Barbara A. Niland: And, George, I'd like to add, Mike mentioned, Mike is saying this is for the lumpiness there. But we've seen some great performance on NSC at Ingalls this year and with the delivery of NSC-4 and the benefits of zero production, risk retirement is all about timing and events that occur. And this year, we had quite a few good events, with the launch of 26, with the delivery of NSC-4, we did well on LHA-6 in terms of delivery. So across-the-board, you can't really look at this quarter-over-quarter, we're getting into some of those phases at Newport News, we have the launch of Warner this year. So depending on the timing of our risk retirement event and as you'll see some lumpiness in quarters, but for the year, you'll see a more solid 9%.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research: And let me follow a little bit, Mike, you mentioned at Newport News, you mentioned in your initial comments. So how much -- you talked about pressure there, so how do you manage that, from a perspective like how much margin risk that you're willing to take by keeping people on board, that are effectively waiting for this contract to occur? So how do you manage that?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. I mean, we don't really -- we don't -- like I've said before, we don't have anybody that's sitting on the bench, waiting for the job to show up. What we have to deal with is how do you hire up to support the new job. And so the timing of the beginning of the contract, the timing of the ramp and the workforce, the managing the labor resource plan in our shipyards, that's the heartbeat of our business. And our folks have to be -- they have to be very good at that, if you want to be really good at shipbuilding. And so it's not a matter of keeping people around, waiting for the contract. It's a matter of anticipating the signing of the contract so you can begin the process of staffing to support that. The real challenge is that if you -- these things are usually timed pretty well, so that as we come off of one program, we're starting up on the next program. And so the people can move from one program to the next. This challenge that we're getting into now is that as people start to move off of the Ford and as people start to move off of the 72, as they head towards the delivery, they need to have the work to go to. And that's why we need to get that work under contract. And that's the balance that we're trying to deal with there, George. And that's how, you can get out of balance. If they have nowhere to go, then we're forced to make some really tough decisions with the workforce. But then that affects our business base, which effects our rates, which then has a program affect.
Operator: And Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you -- my guess, Mike, just because I don't know as I know the business as well on a UPI, but just looking on what's going on in the energy markets and with the fall on commodity prices. Can you just talk about how does that ultimately play out for UPI? And then does that affect at all the Kinder Morgan discussions and the thought about what that means in terms of an alternate use for Avondale?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. That's an interesting question, it's one we've been kicking around here for the last 30 days as well. I don't think you can turn on the news now without somebody talking about what their projection for the oil price is going to be. And so our obvious questions what does that mean for our business? There's a lot of macro discussion about what impact it might have on capital investment and investment in projects by the major oil companies and the major energy companies. But what we're seeing right now, with the customers that we have is, we haven't seen any real change in their commitment to the projects that we're engaged in. And in fact, the discussion over the last 48 hours about the possibility of Keystone is positive for our business. And so at the macro level, I think everybody is watching that and trying to figure out how do you count for that and how do you value that. But business is local here, and our local businesses are still fully engaged. I'll remind you that our business at UniversalPegasus is not just in Houston, it's also in Calgary and it's in Aberdeen. And so the work that we're doing there is high-quality work, and we believe that there will continue to be customers for high-quality engineering work in this space.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then I know you talked about a balanced capital deployment before. So I just look at the relatively little share repurchase activity this quarter, you did still have remaining authorization before it got extended. And so I guess, how should we think about how you look at share buybacks? Should you be in the market on a regular basis, on a quarterly basis? Is it more opportunistic when you think the share count or the shares look attractive? How do you think about that?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, I think it's a matter of both. So when we first got our first authorization, it was really anti-dilutive. As we're going forward, we're doing a combination for anti-dilution. We're looking for some opportunistic buying also.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. If I can sneak one more in. Did you have any retentions, benefit or release on the NSC-4? Or is that too small to ship for us to kind of see that?
Barbara A. Niland: We did -- all ships have retention. But we just delivered that, and so we'll have a little benefit there.
Operator: And Our next question comes from John Godyn of Morgan Stanley.
John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to, Mike, follow-up on the idea of balanced capital deployment. And what I'm getting at here is that a lot of the other defense companies have maintained very imbalanced capital returns plans. Ones that favor shareholder returns pretty aggressively, and it's worked out very well for the stocks. So could you just kind of help us understand why is that balanced approach better?
C. Michael Petters: Look, I think that everybody is in a particularly unique situation. And I'm not going to suggest that a balanced approach that we are taking is better than, maybe, return to shareholder approach that any other company is taking. Because it does depend on what you -- where you are in your life, and it depends on where you are in terms of your capabilities and what you see as your opportunities. We believe that we have tremendous capability in our business to go and do things in not just shipbuilding, but in other places. We just believe that. And the challenges that whenever companies try to do this, they've walked into other markets, and they say, here we are, give us all the work. And that never works out very well. And our view is that if you can go and be supportive of somebody who is already successful in that business and they can tap into your strength, which are, as I mentioned before, our ability to build to create workforce, then you have an opportunity to create value that otherwise was not there. We are still working our way through the process of increasing our dividends and increasing our share buybacks. We're balancing that with our opportunity, try to open channels in other markets. And I think that if you really go behind the curtain in some of what these other folks that you're talking about are doing, you'll hear them talk about other markets as well. They talk about it in terms of international or applying their technology, just a -- specific technology to a specific market. We're not nearly as big as those guys are, but we do have some pretty strong engineering talent, we're trying to find a way to deploy that. In the end, it's a capital-intensive -- shipbuilding is a capital-intensive business. So it consumes, probably more capital than some other businesses. And but it requires a pretty strong engineering contingent to go forward. And so our view is and our task is to create -- is to achieve the full potential of this business, and we think balancing that is a way to do it.
John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. Very helpful. And when we think about the story over the last few years, it's just been a tremendous margin expansion story. And it really speaks to your execution and the execution of the employees. I think investors are a little bit at sort of a transitioned point here, kind of thinking well, what's the next leg? If there isn't more to go on margins, is there a revenue opportunity that we're not seeing? If it doesn't sound like an aggressive capital returns plan is really the direction the team is going. How do you think about the kind of key value drivers over the next few years from here?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I would also tell you, it's not just the investors that are talking about that. I mean, that's the discussion that we're having as well. And I'll go back to my channel discussion, if you are in any business and you had a channel where -- and your business was focused on one particular market, one particular channel, and the outlook in that channel was, maybe, flat or not growing at the rate that you think you need to have to create the value or achieve the potential of your business, you would try to find other ways to achieve that potential. And so that's kind of the way that we're working on this. What I would suggest to you, though is that one of the reasons we said 2015 and not 2014 was that we recognized that we still have risks to retire in our core business. And so as we're having these discussions, we're balancing that with the risks of the new contracts that we are executing on at Ingalls and the risk of a lead ship delivery at Newport News. We're balancing all of that and where do we go from 2015? That's the discussion that we're having as well. And as we get more insight into that, we'll bring you along. At this point, we think opening up another channel for our capability makes some sense. But we also want to bring, in a balanced way, we want to bring our employees and our shareholders along with us.
Operator: And our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: The cash quarter earning, let's start there for a second. Barb, I think the fourth quarter has been your strongest cash quarter for ever. Any reason why the fourth quarter won't be yet again the strongest cash quarter of the year?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, we had couple of interesting things happened during the year. So one, we were able to recover some of our rates from Katrina-related matters, so we really had a good second and third quarter. And I look at the fourth quarter, we are usually have a little seasonality with the cash in the fourth quarter. I would expect it to be similar. But I will caution you that it's all about timing in terms of invoices. So December 31, be anxiously checking the bank account to see where we are, because if we missed by a day, it goes into 2015. So as long as the payment cycle continues at the past, as it has the last few years, we should see similar pattern.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And it looks like it'll be healthy positive working capital, which -- for the quarter, which puts you in shouting range of neutral for the full year, which is pretty darn good. And I wanted to touch on the pension, Barb, because I think there's certainly, the MAP-21, highway bill extension and your prior way of calculating it, I guess, it's not going to have an impact on you. Can you just give us confirmation that it's not going to have an impact on you on a go-forward basis, #1? And then also any sensitivity on mortality tables?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay. So I said I wasn't going to give anything -- any sensitivities on mortality tables or anything. We're coming through all that. And one of the reasons is, we want to compare those mortality tables to our actual experience. So we're doing a much bigger deep dive on the mortality tables. Now as far as not having -- the MAP-21 not having an impact, there is 2 ways you can do all your calculation for your cash recovery, we selected a little different method that was called the method A, where we used the current market interest rates, because that more closely matches with our cash recoveries with our contributions. So, I really want to give you more color at the end of the year, once we complete all the analysis on that.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then last one, Mike. So if you come to -- you got a couple of earns in the fire with respect to the expansion and to adjacencies. If you come to an agreement with Kinder Morgan on the JV, is there a scenario where what you've created in the other segment can almost be an equity contributions to JV and alleviate some of the -- I don't know, but the lack of clarity on the business of expanding into that market, and maybe put in into it a separate shell, where you tap in to your desire to develop the workforce but you don't necessarily take away some of the attention from the core business?
C. Michael Petters: Good question. I guess, without talking about any specific possibility, I would say that we're considering all kinds of alternatives for that asset. I mean, the Avondale asset, in terms of its location and its capability and the ability to track workforce there is a tremendous asset. And it's incumbent upon us to try to find the best way to get full value out of that. And so I'd say, nothing is off the table at this point.
Operator: And our next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: I apologize, I got on late. So if this is already asked, I apologize. But, Mike, any update on SSP and X content. I know GD is progressing along there, I'm just wondering if you guys are generating any revenue on that program? And if not, when we might expect any kind of meaningful content for you guys?
C. Michael Petters: Well, the construction program starts in 2021, and so design work is starting to ramp up at this point. And I'm not exactly sure of what not being an account. I'm not exactly sure what meaningful means. But we're engaged in a project and we're engaged with the folks at General Dynamics. And we're engaged with the Navy on what's the best way ahead to make that project as affordable as we can make it. Because it has a major impact to the overall volume of other programs. And I think that, that's -- our interest is in continuing to invest in a way and support in a way that will continue to drive the cost of that program down.
Operator: At this time, I see no further questions in queue. I'd turn it back to you, Mr. Petters.
C. Michael Petters: Well, again, thank you. We're very pleased with where we are, in terms of our path to efficiency and performance in 2015. We've highlighted today some of the market risks that sits out there, but we're encouraged by the path that we see towards regular order. And frankly, what we've been doing for the last couple of years sets us up very well for positive outcomes, should regular order breakout. And so we're really encouraged by that. And we've also been pleased with the acquisition that we've made, both Stoller and with UPI. The integration of those continues, and we continue to move ahead. Our balance cash flow deployment strategy, we think makes a lot of sense and is the best way to create more value in this business. So we appreciate your interest this morning. And we look forward to seeing you. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thanks, Nicholas. Good morning, and welcome to Huntington Ingalls Industries Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barb Niland, Corporate Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements, and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law, actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also, in the remarks today, Mike and Barb will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including certain segment and adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation, as well as our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
C. Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning we reported strong second quarter 2014 financial results, primarily driven by operating margin improvement and cash generation at our Ingalls segment. As we continue improving performance, I am confident that we will deliver on our goal to achieve 9-plus% operating margin in 2015. For the quarter, sales of $1.7 billion were up 2% from last year, and segment operating margin was 9.5%, up from 8.1% last year. Operating margin at our Ingalls segment improved from 5.2% last year to 10.3%, while our Newport News segment continued to deliver solid performance at 9.2% for the quarter. Diluted EPS was $2.04 for the quarter, compared to $1.12 last year. Additionally, we received $7 billion in new contract awards during the quarter, which increased our backlog to $24 billion, of which $14 billion is funded. The acquisition of UniversalPegasus was completed during the quarter, and we started the integration of UPI team into the HII family. We are excited about the possibilities as we combine HII's engineering and program management core competencies with UPI technical strength and insight in a growing commercial energy infrastructure market. During our Q1 earnings call in early May, we expressed concern that the lack of funding in the FY '15 budget proposal for the Refueling and Complex Overhaul of CVN 73 George Washington would impact the planning necessary to execute the RCOH, in accordance with the current plan of record. Since that time, there have been several positive developments regarding the defense budget. Newport News was awarded a contract to begin planning of defueling work on George Washington late last week. And we view this as another positive step toward a contract for the full RCOH in FY 2015. In the House, the FY 2015 authorization and appropriation bills have been approved, including funds and authority for Newport News to perform the Washington RCOH. The house authorization bill also supported construction of LPD-28, the 12th ship in the class, and provided incremental funding authority for that ship. On the Senate side, both the authorization and appropriations defense subcommittees included funding and authority for the George Washington RCOH and LPD-28 in their respective bills. However, based on the current legislative calendar, it does not appear that final bills will come to the Senate floor for a full vote before the mid-term elections. Now given the potential implications that decisions in these areas have on the industrial base, our workforce and other programs, and the likelihood of a continuing resolution later this year, we remain engaged with the Navy congressional leadership and our suppliers to ensure that our positions are clearly communicated and understood. And now, I will hit a few highlights of our major programs beginning with Ingalls. LPD-26 John P. Murtha is 70% complete and the team remains on track to launch the ship in the fourth quarter this year. LPD-27 Portland is making steady progress through the shop and unit manufacturing phases of construction and preparation for launch next year. LHA-6 America completed postdelivery work and departed the yard in early July, and this marks the final milestone on the last of the underperforming contracts. The keel laying ceremony for LHA-7 Tripoli occurred in June. And the team continues to make steady progress. In addition, Ingalls was awarded an affordability design contract for early industry involvement to reduce the construction and lifecycle cost of LHA-8. In the National Security Cutter program, NSC-4 Hamilton completed successful builders trials in mid-July, and is on track for delivery to the Coast Guard in September. NSC-5 James is progressing through its post-launch activities. NSC-6 Munro early fabrication continues. We are beginning to prepare for construction of NSC Kimball -- NSC-7 Kimball, and we received a contract to purchase long-lead materials for NSC-8 Midgett. On the DDG-51 program, DDG-113 John Finn is continuing through the unit manufacturing and erection phases of construction, and remains on track to be delivered to the Navy in 2016. Early fabrication work for DDG-114 Ralph Johnson is progressing, and we are still preparing for construction to begin in the fall on DDG-117 Paul Ignatius. Regarding the DDG-1001 deckhouse, the delivery date was extended into the third quarter to accommodate additional work scope. That work has now been completed and the deckhouse was delivered to the customer last week. And now that this work is complete, we are proceeding with the shutdown of the Gulfport facility. At Avondale, unit construction for LPD-27 will continue into the fourth quarter of 2014. Our joint study group with Kinder Morgan Energy Partners that is evaluating best use opportunities for redeveloping Avondale is still ongoing. As we have as stated before, if an economically viable best use of the facility is determined, the companies may pursue the formation of a joint venture to redevelop the Avondale site together. However, if we are unsuccessful in these efforts, we will proceed with our plan of record and close the facility. And now turning to Newport News. CVN-78 Ford is approximately 80% complete, and continues through the final outfitting and test phases of construction. Delivery remains on track for 2016. For CVN-79 Kennedy, engineering and design material procurement and advanced unit construction activities continue under the construction preparation contract. Award of the detail design and construction contract is expected later this year. In submarines, SSN-785 John Warner, our first Block III delivery boat, is making steady progress in preparation for its christening in early September. In addition, we completed and shipped to Electric Boat the last module on SSN-786 Illinois. CVN-72 Lincoln has successfully completed several major milestones, and the team remains focused on activities to support undocking in the third quarter. CVN-65 Enterprise continues to progress through its 38-month contract for the inactivation and the defueling of its 8 nuclear reactors. In closing, now that all of the Ingalls ships associated with the underperforming contracts are delivered to the customer and out of our facilities, Huntington Ingalls remains focused on continued program execution, risk retirement and cash generation, which positions us to achieve the goals that we established when we spun off in 2011. That concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barbara A. Niland: Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. As I discuss key highlights from the second quarter, please remember, starting in January of this year, our CMSD and AMSEC businesses were realigned under our Newport News segment, and our prior-year results reflect this change. Additionally, we have added a new Other segment in our financial reporting, which reflects the results from our recent acquisition of UPI since the closing at the end of May. Moving to consolidated results shown on Page 4 of the presentation. Similar to Q1, we have a straightforward quarter, with modest sales growth and strong operating margin performance that was primarily driven by risk retirement at Ingalls. Total revenues increased 2% for the quarter due to increased sales at Newport News. Total operating income was $181 million, up 56% over prior year, mainly driven by increased operating income at Ingalls and a favorable FAS/CAS Adjustment. Free cash flow for the quarter of $245 million was significantly better than Q2 2013, primarily due to improvement in working capital and lower pension contribution. During the quarter, we made the remaining $84 million of our $123 million qualified pension contribution for 2014. Capital expenditures of $27 million were $2 million more than the same period last year, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for the full year to be in the 3% of sales range. Under our share repurchase program, we purchased approximately 817,000 shares at a cost of $80 million in the quarter, and we used $226 million for the purchase of UPI, bringing our quarter-end cash balance to $592 million. Now moving on to segment results on Page 5. Ingalls had slightly lower sales, but significant operating income growth for the quarter. Sales were down 3% due to lower volume on LHA-6 and LPD-25. Operating margin was up 508 basis points over the prior-year quarter, primarily due to continued risk retirement on the NSC and LPD programs, as well as a $6 million favorable overhead adjustment, resulting from a change in non-income based tax liabilities. Turning to Page 6. Newport News second quarter sales increased 3%, primarily due to the acquisition of Stoller, which contributed $28 million to Q2 revenue, as well as higher volume in submarines and energy programs. Operating margin for the quarter was 9.2%, down 40 basis points from last year, mainly due to lower risk retirement on both the VCS program and the execution contract for the Roosevelt RCOH, partially offset by risk retirement on Ford. Regarding 2014, our estimates for the FAS/CAS Adjustment, interest expense and taxes are not materially different from our previous guidance. In summary, we had a good quarter, and as Mike stated, we are on track to achieve our 2015 goal. That wraps up my remarks and with that, I'll turn the call over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thanks, Barb. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to 1 initial question and 1 follow-up. [Operator Instructions] Nicholas, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is actually Chris Sands on for Joe. Barb, I was wondering if you could quantify the net positive adjustments in Ingalls, just given you called out the risk retirements on NSC and LPD, and the margin overall is quite strong?
Barbara A. Niland: Sure. When I look at the net contract adjustments were $64 million favorable, and we had $75 million favorable key [ph] adjustments against $11 million unfavorable. So that's your net $64 million. And they were -- those favorable adjustments were primarily attributable to the Virginia class program's risk retirement, NSC program's risk retirement, CVN-78 risk retirement. And then on LPD delivered ship, we were able to complete deferred work on their ships for less than we had reserved for that. So had some favorable performance there. And on the $11 million of the unfavorable adjustments, there wasn't any individual item that was significant.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Can you say, how much of the $64 million was in the Ingalls segment?
Barbara A. Niland: We don't really break it out in -- by program or by segment on that.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Is it reasonable, as we look to the second half, because even excluding the $6 million overhead adjustment, you were still at 9.3%, but is it reasonable to assume that margin in the second half, just given the mix, is probably lower than that 9.3% because Q2 had higher-than-average favorable adjustments?
Barbara A. Niland: That is correct, because you won't have LPD delivered ship impact. So that is correct.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then sticking with margin, can you give us an idea of what margin in the Other segment would have been if you didn't have the purchase accounting adjustments?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, I'll -- give you that it's a services business. And you'll still see the amortization of the purchase intangibles for a little bit. So think of normal services somewhere between the 5% and 7% range.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then the last one, can you say, how much of the $200 million, or roughly $200 million LHA-6 retention was released in the quarter?
Barbara A. Niland: I won't give you specific numbers, but I will tell you a significant portion of it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Mike, I'm just trying to figure out how your sense of how the CVN-72 RCOH kind of plays out from here? I think, typically, historically when kind of all 4 defense committees are very supportive of a program, simply that has a big impact on DoD thinking. And I think, Sean Stackley has made some relatively positive comments about that, but kind of couched it in terms of 2016 sequestration. So I'm wondering if you think that the Navy has kind of done a 180 on program or if you think there are still some challenges ahead, given sequestration for that program specifically?
C. Michael Petters: Well, first of all, I'm not sure that 180 accurately describes the Navy's position. I think the Navy always wanted to do it, but has been wrestling with how pay for it. And raised the flag and said, "We can't afford to do it." Congress has now come back and said, "You need to go do it. It is a priority, go figure that out." The Navy has basically said, "Okay, but sequestration is still out there, so it's still a challenge to go figure out how to pay for it." We think all of that is -- given -- our preferred path would have been that there would have been none of this discussion. We think that given that it was started out as something that may not happen, and it’s in a good place now. The fact that we just signed this defueling contract is a positive indication. It's certainly, not the contract to go get the refueling done. And doing it in this incremental fashion is not optimum, but I think that you're right. I think the congress has made its intent very clear. I think the Navy, as they are kind of figuring out their budgets going forward, are trying to figure out how they're going to do this. And I think, it's not just the carrier, I think there are a host of programs that they're trying to figure out how to do with the prospect of sequestration looming out there 12 months from now. And I think that's what you're hearing and that's probably a better question to ask the Navy about, but I'm optimistic about where we have come to on this program at this point. And on both this program and on the LPD-28, I think the Congress is in both cases, is making its position pretty clear about the priority of those programs. And starting from where we were at the beginning of the year, we are very pleased with where we are. We recognize that there's lot more to be done.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Okay, got it. Just one follow-up for Barb. I know, typically you don't like talk too much about pension, but we are into August now, there's a lot going on with the yields coming in and the MAP-21 legislation and mortality tables. I'm just wondering if you hold some of your key assumptions flat like ROA and what not. Can you give us the sense of what kind of maybe headwinds you might face on pension, net pension 2015, and would there be an opportunity to kind of head that off with maybe a cash infusion in the back half of this year?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay. So you know, I'm not going to give you anything on 2015, too many moving parts. I will tell you, we have seen a reduction in our discount rate of about 60 basis points. So we're taking a look at that. We are looking at the Society of Actuaries' new mortality tables which they released last week. I will tell you that, from my 10,000 foot view, it will likely increase both FAS and CAS, pension expense. It will increase our abilities. It could potentially increase our funding requirements, but it's not necessarily all equal. We did see good returns on assets through the end of June, 8.3%. We did give a little bit of that in July. So, we've got to just wait until the end of the year, when we do our remeasurements, and I'll give you a lot more color at that point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Barb, can I just follow-up on that last comment? Don't you do some sort of change in the third quarter, typically where you make some adjustments in terms of your FAS/CAS for this year, and add the plan to...
Barbara A. Niland: Yes, and we've already looked at that, and right now, we're seeing about a $4 million reduction in CAS. So I think I gave you on the original update, $92 million net FAS/CAS income. We're at about $88 million right now. So a small change there. That's why I said, most everything held, materially speaking. So we could -- it's something we continue to watch. A lot of moving parts, as you know. So we'll update you as we have more information.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just trying to think back on the cash flow, a nice collection in terms of the receivables, and I'm trying to just understand was that LHA-6 risk retirement related, or is that somewhat sustainable? Just because when I look at the last few years, you've typically improved in the third and the fourth quarters from the second quarter levels. I'm trying to just think about what's unusual or different this year?
Barbara A. Niland: No. LHA-6, when I think about the retention -- it was a big retention. And when we delivered that ship, the ship was in very good shape. So we collected a significant portion of that retention. So that's a onetime event. But when you think about it, other ships are progressing. And so their retentions are also increasing. So it's not a one for one, I got this huge benefit there. Then, the other thing, and I've talked about this on prior calls, we had some outstanding Katrina-related items, cash items in terms of billing rates that we were negotiating with our customer, and we've come through part of that. So we did get an adjustment on our billing rates in the quarter. So we received some cash that may have been withholding from us for a long period of time. There is still more to come on the Katrina piece. So those are probably the 2 biggest items. We're very focused on working capital. We had a great quarter. And much better than we've seen. In quarters past, we've always been a cash user through the second quarter, the last 3 years. This time, we're a cash provider. So we'll continue to focus on it and continue to working on it.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then just -- if I can sneak one more, and what is the remaining authorization at this point for share buyback?
Barbara A. Niland: 70 -- In the $70 million range.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.
John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Mike, the company continues to execute well. I was hoping that you could just update us on your thoughts on the 9% margin target. Is there anything that you're seeing that might suggest some upside potential to that target?
C. Michael Petters: That target to be at 9% for next year remains intact and I think, we're still on track for that. In fact, I think, this quarter is evidence that we're strongly on track for that. I think that when you start thinking about the upside to 9%, I've said many times, that a healthy shipbuilding business operates in the 9% to 10% range, based on the maturity of its programs, the sustainability of its programs, and the amount of serial production versus lead ship work that you're doing. And so our view is that it's going to be in that band of 9% to 10%. That's where we plan to operate the business, because we have so many different classes of ships. While we believe we are -- we're really solidly on track for 2015, and I think that the challenge that is out there in front of us is the sustainability of that. And that's tied up in the question of sequestration and LPD-28 and the CVN-73, and all of those issues, which is why this business has a horizon that's probably a little bit further out than most other businesses. So I think we're going to be in the band where we think it's going to be healthy for us to operate, and we're going to persevere to stay in that band.
John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Fair enough. And without being too precise, I mean, there is a difference between 9% and 10%. I'm just curious, what do you think sort of drives the top end versus the bottom end of that band as we lookout the next few years?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. I think you -- I think, that's pretty straightforward. You take a look at the product mix and the contract types. The more mature the programs, meaning the less design change there is, the more repetition there is, the more serial production there is, the more likely you can get to the top end of that band. The more design work that you're doing, the more lead ship kinds of things that you're doing, or the more one-off kinds of things you're doing, the more likely you're going to be in the bottom end of that band. In our business, we kind of have a lot of that going on. Today, we are lead ship going on the -- in the carrier program, for example. And so that -- as the Ford moves out and the Kennedy comes on over the next 5 years, I would expect that you'd see a different -- a little bit different approach there. But that's going to take some time for it to play out. It's not going to happen in the quarter or 2. It's going to be over a 3- to 5-year period.
John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great.
C. Michael Petters: And then there'll be an ebb and flow to it. So, yes, there's a difference between 9% and 10%, but there's a difference between 2015 and 2020 as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: My first question is the net -- the favorable adjustments have been running more like, even in good quarters, like $60 million. In this quarter you did $75 million. Is it a decent assumption, Barb, to assume that, that $15 million difference was due to the LPD issue that you addressed?
Barbara A. Niland: You're close. I'll -- that's -- you're close.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then, going forward, would it be reasonable in good times to assume that you'd probably go back down to around the $60-kind-of-million favorables and then maybe unfavorables when you've been good is somewhere around $10 million, $11 million, like we've seen this quarter, is that a reasonable thing to look going forward?
Barbara A. Niland: I think that is reasonable. It might be a little high. It's really timing. It can be lumpy. It depends what events. We'll have a delivery of NSC-4, you'll have launches occur. You'll have different risk retirements. So, I know you don't like when the use the word lumpy, but it can vary significantly. So it's hard to -- if you want to say over an average, maybe over a long period of time. But it can fluctuate.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then last one. The unbilled receivables have gone up, to the end of '13 from '12. It doesn't look like you give them interim year in the Qs, but could you provide where the unbilled receivable number might be now or where you might expect to go by the end of the year?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, in that unbilled, you have a bunch of categories. You have Avondale restructure, you have Gulfport accelerated depreciation, you have the Katrina-related matters, and you have contract retentions, and then you have progress limitations on your ships. I would like to say that, that number will come down by the end of the year. But there's a lot of negotiations, some ships -- got to deliver NSC-4, collect that retention. The Avondale restructuring negotiations, the Gulfport accelerated depreciation negotiations, all those have to take place. The answer is, it's really just timing. And it's how much we can accomplish between now and the end of the year. And I can assure you, we're working very hard to accomplish some of these.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I want to congratulate you both, Mike and Barb, on really doing a nice job here to hit your targets and get your plan. That being the case, Mike, I wanted to start by asking you, if you're at the point here, where you're at that 9% level, assuming sales are roughly stable, I understand that sequestration could throw a monkey wrench in there. Is that the way we think about the business? Sort of follow-up on earlier question. So you're essentially at a 9% to 10% margin on about $1.7 billion in sales going forward? And is there point at which you'd start providing, at least, EPS guidance on that?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think, first of all, I think that it's a little premature to say that we've completely hit the targets. We are still not in 2015 yet, and so we're -- we've had a great quarter and we're having a good year. And we are on track to make our 2015 targets, but we've got a lot of work to do between now and then to get across that finish line, and we're not going to take our eye off that ball. And having said that, I think that it is fair to say that for the business going forward, you can think of the shipbuilding business as being a 9% to 10% business. We're excited about the possibilities that we have seen in some of the engineering work outside of shipbuilding. This year, we've acquired S.M. Stoller for Department of Energy work, and we've just completed the UPI acquisition. We don't expect those businesses to perform in the 9% to 10% range. But we do expect the ROI on that business to be very good, because that's good engineering services work. And we are already seeing that, that's our good marriage between the bandwidth that those companies have, the access to those marketplace, and the depth that exist in the business today on the engineering side. And so, we think there's a core business of shipbuilding in the 9% to 10% range and that there's opportunity for some incremental growth outside of that. And so, if you start thinking about the business, then that's the way, I think, that going forward, you'll be thinking about it. And it's not likely in that environment -- I don't see us trying to go and part -- parse out what the EPS guidance might be on any particular quarter, or even any particular year yet. I think it's better to think about this business in terms of the horizon that it sets. Our horizon that we set and we've been tracking to, has been the 2015 targets. We are on track for those and we're closing in on those. And over the next 6 to 12 months, we'll be talking to you about our next horizon.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. A related question though, more from a cash flow perspective. If the Kinder Morgan JV is a go, what kind of cash capital commitment might you expect? How should we think about that? And then I have one other quick one.
C. Michael Petters: But I -- that's one's -- it's way too early for us to -- we're looking at such a wide range of opportunities there. It would be too hard to narrow that down. I'd just say stay tuned on that one.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then last, on SSBN(X). What's your view on a sole-source type of arrangement versus the type of joint venture that you have now on Virginia class?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think the way to think about the Ohio replacement program is that the nation has a submarine industrial base that's going to produce that platform. It's not clear to me yet exactly, how the business arrangements going to be worked out with the Navy on getting that done. But the submarine industrial base, of which Newport News is a major part -- participant in that, the submarine industrial base will be producing Virginia class submarines and Ohio Replacement Programs, and we fully expect to be involved in all of that work. And so, the question of how the business arrangement works out sole-source, teaming arrangement, some other arrangement, I think is TBD.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So would you say that if they do go with the prime sole-source style approach that the other guy will likely participate in some fashion, material fashion anyway?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think -- as I've said, I think the submarine industrial base, in its entirety, will be required to support this program. So we expect to be part of the program.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Mike, I'd like to see if you can talk a little bit about the strategy for UniversalPegasus and the S.M. Stoller acquisitions. Because when we look at these, they seem to be quite different businesses than your traditional business, even though they all are involved in large engineering projects. So if you could talk a little bit about what you ultimately see as the scale of these? What benefits Huntington Ingalls brings to UniversalPegasus, for example, that could make that a stronger company in the future?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I guess, I would, first of all disagree with your premises -- your premise that they're very different from what we do, because, in fact, they're not. If you step back and look at shipbuilding and say, what does it take to be a good shipbuilder, your better be darn good at engineering, you better be darn good at managing a supply chain, and you've got to be able to be good at heavy manufacturing. We step back and look at who else in the planet needs folks who are good at engineering, good at supply chain management and good at manufacturing. We see a whole lot of folks who need that kind of support. Now, we recognize that in these other markets, there are other ways to get things done. And there are other ways to be successful, and we don't always have all the best solutions in our own pocket. So we've decided that we're going to, as we think our way through what are those other markets and customers look like and how can we best serve them, we're going to be thinking our way through that through our engineers, because our engineering capability inside of our businesses is very deep and very broad. And so, what we've done is that in the Department of Energy space, S.M. Stoller is a company that has access to a couple of dozen DOE sites. And they do engineering services in a pretty robust way for a broad set of Department of Energy customers. We have a lot of depth to back them up, and we already have recognized that a combination of their customer access and our depth gives us opportunities that neither one of us would have been able to pursue before. And we expect that, that will play out for us very nicely over the next 3 to 5 years. Relative to UniversalPegasus, we just had them on board now for a couple of months. They also have a pretty broad perspective on engineering services in the oil and gas space. And we expect that it will play the same way, as we see the S.M. Stoller acquisition playing for us. Their access to these markets and customers, their intimate knowledge of what it takes to be successful, combined with the breadth and depth of our capability, and especially in engineering, we think will give us opportunities to pursue things that neither HII nor UPI, UniversalPegasus, could have done by itself. And so there's more to come on that, Doug, but the fundamental premise that they're not like us, I think, we're finding that to be completely wrong. This engineering work is something that we know how to do, and we do it very well. They have very good engineers who have very deep market access. We think that's a marriage that will create great value for our shareholders.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: When you take this forward, one of the things that, I know many people, when they look at Huntington Ingalls, are attractive by is the amount of cash that you're likely to generate over the next few years. When you look forward with these new businesses, would you see this as the first in a string of acquisitions or significant investments? I'm trying to get a sense of how this could affect cash deployment over the next few years.
C. Michael Petters: Well, we have said from the beginning that our philosophy on cash deployment is going to be, has been and continues to be very balanced. We are always looking for ways to create value for our shareholders, and we will continue to do that. [Audio Gap] And whether that turns into adjacent acquisition that makes sense for us or returning cash to shareholders, we're doing those, we're doing all of those evaluations and we continue to be and expect to be on the way forward going to be very balanced in that approach.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: But as you look at this, at these first 2 acquisitions, how are you thinking about the next years? Just in terms of where the scale and range of these new opportunities might head?
C. Michael Petters: Well, first of all, we're thinking about the next couple of years, we've got -- we frankly have to get through the Navy side of our business in -- through 2015, and get through this whole prospect of sequestration. And that is front and center for this business. These acquisitions, we've had Stoller since the beginning of the year, we've had UPI for just a couple of months, we think that there's great potential there. Prosecuting that potential is going to something that we'll be very focused on. And I would say, Doug, that there is going to be more to come in the future on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Maybe to lead off, Barb, you mentioned that 3% or about 3% target for CapEx, obviously, that would imply a huge ramp in the second half, and in the middle of the year CapEx budgets are often conservative, but can you give us -- is there anything, whether it's tied to the acquisitions or tied to contingencies with any outcomes on the Avondale studies? Or it's really underlying core expansion that you're seeing?
Barbara A. Niland: This is strictly shipbuilding, it's strictly related to the Virginia class program and CVN-79, as well as we upgraded -- or we're in the process of upgrading our welding equipment. So it's all navy shipbuilding.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then, Barb, and then I'll come back to Mike, for a second. But in the original roadshow, you show an escrow for working capital which had a neutral crossing points this year and source of cash in the out years. Where are we on the curve in '14?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, we're a little behind from that presentation, and one of the reasons is at that time, we thought that we would have already closed Avondale and begun recovery of restructuring. So that's moved out a year. We did not know we would be closing GulfPort, so that added. But the rest of it is pretty much intact. So those 2 items have kind of shifted that a little bit to the right.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: But the -- so then, for planning purposes, neutralization in '15 would seem like a reasonable target?
Barbara A. Niland: It should be. Again, timing of negotiations, that type of things, but yes. I mean, I'd like to get some of it this year, we'll see how it goes. Like I've said, I was very focused on working capital. And my team, I meet on a regular basis, and I know what working capital is by program. And they are tuned in with me.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And the last one, Mike, I guess a follow-up to Doug's question on the pursuits here and the adjacency, but you've made the steps in the engineering side, and just Barb alluded to the margins in the services business, that their invested capital also on the minimal side. Do you think that there is really a capability or a value-add to go in-house manufacturing and construction at Huntington Ingalls?
C. Michael Petters: I think that remains to be seen, Myles. Our experience in this, and I think the long experience with Navy shipbuilders, is that when we lead with manufacturing, we can sometimes break our knees. What I like about leading with engineers is that, first of all, we do have a tremendous amount of depth and capability inside of the company. We understand engineering. When our engineers go outside of the government and they go talk to commercial folks who are doing engineering, they all speak the same language. And so from that standpoint, it's a little bit of more of a -- of our own field that we're on when we go do that. Secondly, I think, you can gain keen insights into a market space through the eyes of your engineers. They can see where the opportunities are. They can see where the stuff -- where the problems that need to be solved, that will require difficult solutions are. And we're frankly, a company that's going to be better suited to solve the tough problems as opposed to being trying to line up and compete with a lot of folks who are all solving fairly simple problems. And so, that's kind of my thinking on it right now. Whether that actually translates into significant manufacturing opportunity, I'm not sure. And it's a little hard for me to imagine that we would do a lot of that manufacturing inside of our government facilities. I mean, we just -- the cost structures and the requirement are just so fundamentally different that, I would imagine that the manufacturing would be separate. So -- but the plan now is to lead into these markets through the eyes and ears and brains of our engineers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I've got a couple of quick questions. First, Barb, on the Avondale recovery, is this just the case of finishing up your negotiations with the Navy, or is it contingent upon a final decision on uses of Avondale and the things that you're doing with Kinder Morgan?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, it is contingent upon that, because we won't close it until we finish those discussions. And then, talk about the navy. So remember, there's 2 pieces, there's the human capital piece and then there's the asset piece. And so, what would happen is the asset piece -- if we found something to do with Kinder Morgan, the asset piece would go with that, but the human capital piece would be recovered under restructuring with the Navy.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Mike, on UPI, can you talk a little bit about what you view their organic growth opportunities to be? What kind of market have they operated in? And are there any large deals that their bidding on, or you think that there's some potential for that we ought to be kind of keeping track of here over time, just to give us the sense of how to track this business?
C. Michael Petters: Well, Sure. UPI is in a broad range of engineering support services for the oil and gas space. They do some onshore work, they do some off-shore work, actually, which we find very interesting. I think that they have offices not just in Huston, but also in Calgary and Aberdeen. And all of those are places where there are -- there's growing demand for the kind of engineering service work that they do. And so, that is -- that's very exciting to us. As we went through this process, we came upon the notion that suddenly Keystone is very important to us. And so, because they have a principal role in supporting TransCanada's effort on Keystone. So it's a new marketplace and it's a new language and a lot of new customers, and we're still working our way through all of that. But we're excited about what they have in their future. And the fundamental thing is that, I think they have a bright future. I think that they have now more opportunity, because we stand behind them. We stand behind them from a standpoint of resources, we stand behind them from the standpoint of a financial foundation and all of that. So between them and us -- if we had try to go and penetrate that market, if I'd gone and just try to open an office in Calgary with some of my engineers, we would be nowhere. So having this marriage, I think, is going to play out well for both of us.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just a quick follow-up to that, and maybe moving Barb into the discussion, it sounds maybe just that their potential is now greater in light of the financial support that you might be able to offer them. Wasn't it a business that was capital starved and does this change the outlook for capital spending, Barb, from a percentage of revenue?
Barbara A. Niland: No. Absolutely not. I think, its more customers are looking at them and they see a nice parent behind them, they feel more comfortable that there is a depth of resources available to complete the contractual work.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then the last one from me, Mike, can you just update us on your, and Barb as well, on the LPDs to the LXR, the gap that might be created if the LPD-28 doesn't come through. Just if you can provide us some financial perspective, what impacts we might see from the revenues and EBIT perspective, if we do end up having a gap, particularly, if you need to do something with your workforce down there? Just set some sort of a base case for us on what happens if we don't get an LPD-28 and we don't get an acceleration on the LXR?
C. Michael Petters: I don't think we have done any sort of financial parameters related to potential scenarios going forward. I think you can set the navy's plan in front of you, and you can see that there is -- LXR, right now, is sitting outside of the 5-year plan, outside of the setup. And so we're finishing -- we're building LPD-26 and 27 and when LPD-27 finishes, there's a definite gap between the finish of LPD-27 and the beginning of LXR. That exists today. That -- if you don't have something else for that workforce to do, then you're going to be downsizing the workforce. And that is -- we started this whole amphibious discussion a couple of years ago with you to guys, telling you that we thought that there's going to be a scrum for priorities and dollars and resources with the shipbuilding account, and we felt like the amphibs were going to be in the middle of it. And we've been working that for a couple of years, and where we are today is -- LPD-28 is -- it's not finished. LPD-28, if we were not where we are, LPD-28 would be a really long shot. At this point, I'd say that we're in the game and we have a chance to get LPD-28 done. And this is critically important to the sustainability of the work that we've accomplished at Ingalls so far.
Barbara A. Niland: And I would add to that, that we're very aware of the potential impact. We are rightsizing as much overhead infrastructure as we possibly can at Ingalls. We're making some major moves. I'm sure you heard that we're putting in some health centers to help get our medical costs down. And Irwin, and now Brian, continuously have made significant changes and overhead structure, and part of it was the fact that we were looking forward and seeing the potential of this base maybe a little bit. So in preparation of that, there's a lot of activity going on in that area.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with CRT Capital.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Just couple of quick questions for wrap things up, because we're coming to the top of the hour. In terms of the share repurchase, can you tell us the number of shares and average price?
Barbara A. Niland: On the share repurchase, I think, that we have repurchased 817,000. I think I've said that in there.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Yes, I just didn't catch that.
Barbara A. Niland: And then the average price was like, $98 and change, like $98.13, and we have $75 million left on the program.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: When do you anticipate increasing that, is that something that, I know it's going to be a board decision, but do you anticipate repurchasing shares and moving forward with your extra cash flow?
Barbara A. Niland: Brian, we'll talk more about the cash deployment and later on in the year.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of Avondale, what would cause a delay in the shutdown and then, number of employees you currently have at Avondale?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay. In terms of number of employees left, I think we're down to like 325 employees. And then, what happens depends on what happens with the Kinder Morgan study.
Barbara A. Niland: Okay. We'll take one more, Dwayne?
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi with UBS.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Mike, could you just offer a little bit more commentary around the Business Development environment, I guess, specifically I have 2 questions. One is, just to take the other side of Jasons' question, if you do get an LPD-28 funded, is that enough, in your view, to bridge amphibious ship constructions through the start of the next-generation amphibious ship program as currently planned? Or do you think you would need yet another LPD on -- do an LPD-29 in order to get you there, and kind of hold the current workforce flat through that period? And then the second part is, do you have any updated thoughts on what the Navy might be envisioning for that LXR program, and also next generation small surface combatant in terms of what design considerations within the context of your existing capability? And then also industrial base considerations? I guess, do these programs appear likely to be a sole-source or some type of share to work agreement like you have on DDG-51?
C. Michael Petters: Good questions. I think the first thing you have to start with is that the bridge you're trying to create is the bridge from the LPD program to the LXR program. And the LXR program right now is outside the fit up. And so until the LXR program shows up in the fit up, you've got -- the plan of record is that it's in the first year after the end of the fit up. And so the gap is fairly long. And that's what would require, in our view, for the production -- for the -- to get from LPD to LXR. LPD-28 is the only logical way to do that. Now, it assumes that the LXR is going to look something like the LPD, and that it's going to have some of the same characteristics and requirements that the class of ships that it's replacing, LSD class of ships, is going to line up. And so there is an underlying assumption that -- there is a line of sight from LPDs to LXRs. And at that timeframe is pretty fixed, but I would say that LXR not being in the fit up yet means there's still potential for the gap to get bigger. And so that means that just makes the LPD-28 that much more important, in our view. Secondly, what we are seeing with the capabilities of the ships is that they're being used for a lot of things. And they're very flexible platforms and all of that, there's lot of testimony that goes in and supports all of that. On the other side of it, Ingalls has come -- they have done a tremendous amount of work. Barb and I started our engagement with that operation almost 7 years ago, I think. And we have come -- we are just beaming with pride over the things that we have been putting in place over time. It's really rewarding to see them come to fruition. And you see that in the performance in this quarter, you'll see that as we continue on our pace to get to our goals for next year. The workforce there has done a tremendous job. The leadership there has done a tremendous job. And there's momentum there. And so, there may be ways to capitalize on that momentum in other ways to help make sure that we get across that bridge. And more to come on that, I guess, as time plays out. But 28 matters a lot. If the bridge gets to be too far, I'm not sure the 29 is going to be put something that's gets put on the table. It would be fun to talk about that. But the fundamental balance between the volume of work and the craft requirement to support the capabilities that need to be put to sea, that's the balance that, when it gets out of balance, it's really hard to restore. And so that's we're working really hard to do right now.
Operator: And with no further questions in the queue, I would like to turn the call back over to Mike Petters for closing remarks.
C. Michael Petters: Sure. Thank you. And thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. As we pointed out, it was a great quarter for the entire corporation. It is, as I've just mentioned, it's very satisfying to see things that we've been putting in place over the several years, all coming to bear. We've got a lot more work to do, but we are very excited about what we've accomplished, and how what we've accomplished will lead to even better things in the future. So we look forward to seeing you around town. And if get the chance, you want to visit one of our facilities, please let us know. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. And have a good day.

With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
C. Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I am pleased to report strong first quarter 2014 financial results that are right in line with our expectations and keep us on the path for our target of 9-plus percent operating margin in 2015. For the quarter, sales of $1.6 billion were up 2% from last year, and segment operating margin was 8.6%, up from 7.7% last year. Operating margin at our Ingalls segment improved from 4.4% last year to 7.9%, continuing a trend of improving performance while our Newport News segment continued to deliver solid performance at 9% for the quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.81 for the quarter, more than double last year. Additionally, we received $2.2 billion in new contract awards during the quarter, which increased our backlog to $18.7 billion of which $13 billion is funded. Regarding the defense budget, there is continued uncertainty about whether sequestration will remain, and it becomes clear each day that this is not the best way to run our government. The debate over performing a refueling and complex overhaul or inactivating CVN-73 George Washington remains unresolved and this midterm issue could become a near-term issue. We are concerned of the lack of funding in the FY '15 budget proposal for the CVN-73 RCOH will impact the planning necessary execute the RCOH in accordance with the current plan of record. Now this is not the ideal situation as it creates unnecessary churn and makes it difficult to plan and schedule the work on all of our other contracts. However, our team remains engaged with the navy and congressional leadership and our suppliers to ensure that potential implications to the industrial base, our workforce and other programs are communicated and understood. Now I will hit a few highlights of our major programs beginning with Ingalls. LPD-26 John P. Murtha achieved stern released in March. The ship is 55% complete and the team is completing the erection phase of production in preparation for launch in the fourth quarter. LPD-27 Portland achieved the 25% structurally complete milestone at the end of March as it continues to progress through the shop and unit manufacturing phases of construction. I am very pleased with our progress on the LPD program. We are seeing improved efficiencies and are leveraging lessons learned and the benefits of serial production from one ship to the next. These are the primary reason you hear us making the case for continuing the production of LPDs as a bridge to the LXR program. LHA-6 America was delivered to the navy in early April, making yet -- marking yet another milestone for HII as we completed the last of the underperforming contracts. She will remain in the yard for completion of postdelivery work and depart in the third quarter. I want to publicly thank the LHA-6 team for producing such a high-quality ship, while keeping the cost within the parameters we established last year. Keel laying for LHA-7 Tripoli occurred as planned in March, and the team continues to make steady progress. The Ceremonial keel laying is scheduled for June. Now regarding LHA-8, we are pleased that funding was included in the FY '15 budget submission to continue design development in support of awarding a detailed design and construction contract in FY '17. In the National Security Cutter program, NSC-4 Hamilton completed engine write-off in early April and remains on track for delivery to the Coast Guard later this. NSC-5 James is 100% structurally erected and was launched this past week. NSC-6 Munro early fabrication is continuing to progress well and we were awarded a contract for construction of NSC-7 Kimball at the end of March. On the DDG-51 program, DDG-113 John Finn is making steady progress through the unit manufacturing and erection phases of construction and remains on track to be delivered to the navy in 2016. Early fabrication work for DDG-114 Ralph Johnson is progressing and we are preparing for construction to begin in the fall of DDG-117 Paul Ignatius. In addition, we received full funding for construction of DDG-119, the second of 5 DDG-51 destroyers we were awarded last June. Regarding the DDG-1001, we remain on track to deliver the deck house from our Gulfport facility in the second quarter. Following completion of this work and the composite mass for LPD-27, we will proceed with the shutdown of the Gulfport facility. At Avondale, unit construction for LPD-27 will continue through the third quarter of 2014. As you know, we recently announced the establishment of a joint study group with Kinder Morgan Energy Partners. The study group has been tasked to evaluate best-use opportunities for redeveloping Avondale. If an economically viable best use of the facility is determined, the companies may pursue the formation of a joint venture to redevelop the Avondale site together. However, as I've said before, if we are unsuccessful on these efforts, we will proceed with our plan of record and close the facility. Now turning to Newport News. CVN-78 Ford is approximately 75% complete and continues through the final outfitting and test phases of construction. Delivery remains on track for 2016. For CVN-79 Kennedy, we received an extension of the construction preparation contract, which continuous engineering and design, material procurement and advanced unit construction activities prior to award of the detailed design and construction contract that is expected later this year. In submarine, SSN-785 John Warner, our first Block III delivery boat, reached pressure hull complete, which is the last major milestone before the submarine's christening this summer. As announced last week, the $17.6 billion Block IV contract for 10 additional submarines was awarded. This program has already proven itself to be one of the best, if not the best performing shipbuilding programs in the country. And we look forward to continuing our important role in building these submarines. CVN-72 Lincoln has completed the first 13 months of a 44-month RCOH. The team has accomplished a tremendous amount of work thus far, and remains focused on activities to support undocking in the third quarter. CVN-65 Enterprise has completed the first 10 months of her 38 month contract for the inactivation and the defueling of it's 8 nuclear reactors with a continued focus on building the ship board defueling complex, completing temporary systems and personnel training and qualification. In closing, now that all of the 5 Ingalls ships associated with the underperforming contracts have been delivered to our customer, our team is focused on continued program execution and risk retirement to drive operating margin to 9-plus percent in 2015. I am extremely pleased with our overall progress thus far, and I want to thank the Ingalls and Newport News teams for maintaining the drive and focus over the last past 3 years to get HII to this point. That concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barbara A. Niland: Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, I will discuss key highlights from the first quarter and as a reminder, starting in January, our CMSD and AMSEC businesses were realigned under our Newport News segment and prior year results reflect this change. Moving to consolidated results shown on Page 4 of our presentation, we had a relatively straightforward quarter with modest sales growth and strong operating margin performance, which was primarily driven by risk retirement at Ingalls. Total revenues increased 2% for the quarter due to increased sales at Newport News. Total operating income was $159 million, up 67% over prior year, which was mainly driven by increased operating income at Ingalls and a favorable FAS/CAS Adjustment. Consistent with prior years, we were cash users in the first quarter. Cash used in operating activities was $214 million, bringing our quarter-end cash balance to $742 million. During the quarter, we made $39 million of our $123 million qualified pension contribution for 2014. We expect to contribute the remaining amount in the second quarter. Capital expenditures of $24 million were $6 million less than the same period last year. However, we continue to expect capital expenditures for the full year to be in the 3% of sales range. Under our share repurchase program, we purchased approximately 250,000 shares on a cost of $25 million. Before I get into segment results, I want to give a quick update on the Avondale restructuring proposal. We recently submitted an updated proposal to the navy, which included total restructuring cost of $284 million, up from the previous total cost of $256 million. The primary driver of the increase is the exclusion of potential recovery from the sale of assets in line with customer guidance. Now moving on to segment results on Page 5. Ingalls had slightly lower sales but significant operating income growth for the quarter. Sales were down less than 1% due to lower volume on LHA-6 and LPD-25. Operating margin was up 350 basis points over prior year quarter, primarily due to continued risk retirement on the NSC and LPD program. Turning to Page 6. Newport News first quarter sales increased 3.5%, primarily due to higher volume in aircraft carrier and the acquisition of Stoller which contributed approximately $25 million in Q1 revenue. Operating margin for the quarter was 9%, down 51 basis points from last year, mainly due to lower risk retirement on the BCF program and risk retirement on the execution contract for the Roosevelt RCOH, partially offset by risk retirement on Ford. Regarding 2014, we are still expecting interest expense to be roughly a $115 million, and our tax rate to be between 33% and 34%. With respect to deferred state taxes, we maintain our estimate at a $5 million benefit for 2014. However, note that our estimate of deferred state taxes can fluctuate due to timing of contract income for tax purposes. Finally, I want to briefly mention the new mortality tables released in January. Because the tables reflect the increased life expectancies, the general consensus is in that costs and liabilities will increase for FAS/CAS and cash. We do not expect this to have an impact on 2014 pension costs, and will provide most specific guidance for 2015 at the end of the year. That wraps up my remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thanks, Barb [Operator Instructions] Jamie, I'll turn it over you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robert Spingarn from Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Mike, as we think about Ingalls and the strength there, you've now essentially delivered all of the 0-margin ships, so congratulations on that. Are we, as we go forward, going into positive cum cash territory, now that you're focused on the more profitable clean sheet ships?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think what you'll see is that Ingalls will start to behave as everyone else in the industry from a financial perspective as the ships that we have mature and we get back to our blended rate of more than 9%. So it shouldn't be -- the 5 underperforming ships created an outlier situation for Ingalls there fore the last [indiscernible] it's good to be behind us. Now we need a little bit of time to get the newest contracts we have matured so that we're performing just like -- basically what everybody else in the industry does.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And given the way -- the ramp that you've previously characterized as conservative on these newer ships, it would seem to me that the 9% target is actually not a final point because at the 9% target you have for next year has these ships still in the early stage margins. So I essentially am asking you what the upside or is there upside to that number as those ships mature?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I mean, I think we talked to this before, Rob, and it's actually the 9 -- my view is that shipyards that are operating well, operate especially when you have multiple platforms and multiple maturities, basically operate somewhere north of 9% and less than 10%. I mean, that 9% to 10% band is kind of where you are. And our view is that, that will be in that -- will be kind of in that band with the right blend and the right maturities next year. And the idea, the hope would be that we'd be able to sustain that. We've got some challenges in terms of sustainment right now around our MFT program that we've been pretty vocal about. And so you see us being very vocal about pushing for a bridge between LPDs and LXRs and what's really driving that, first of all, is that's the most efficient way for the taxpayers to get the ships that they want to buy. But secondly, that's -- the effect of that is that, that creates a sustainment bridge for us and we're able to sustain the performance at Ingalls. And so...
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: When does this bridge -- what's the timing on the bridge, when do you have the volume issue?
C. Michael Petters: Well, it's starts to play out over next 3 -- probably the next 3 to 5 years. So it's a midterm issue for us, which is why we're on it right now.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just -- I was going to ask you the same question on carrier overhaul and maintenance, the bridge question you brought up, that the overhaul, the RCOH on 73 could be a near-term issue. As we think about 72 and the inactivation of 65, given the uncertainty on 73, at what point do we to start to see a hole?
C. Michael Petters: I'm -- you could argue that there's a bit of a hole right now because we're not really planning for -- we're doing a little bit of planning on the 73, but we're not really planning for an RCOH or the inactivation. We're kind of caught in between right now we'd really like to get on with it a little bit. So there's a little bit of a decline -- you probably can't see much of it, but there's a little bit of decline on the planning side right now. But this thing pushes out more than a year, and it starts to become a problem relative to how it effects the rates in the yards, as well as the volume in the yards. So I think this is a 12-month decision for us really for how we're going to proceed.
Operator: The next question comes from Omear Khalid from Goldman Sachs.
Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Apologies if you already discussed -- but wanted to ask a little bit about M&A here. I understand that the M. Stoller acquisition adds the nuclear servicing capabilities at Newport. I want to just focus a little bit on any potential commercial opportunity, especially as it relate to you like in Avondale. Have you guys seen anything, are you guys actively looking on that front?
C. Michael Petters: Well, we're not going to comment on any of the activity. I would just say at this point that what we said before is that our aperture is wide open as we think about the capabilities that we have and how best to deploy those in a moderately risk -- moderate risk environment. So our balance cash flow strategy remains intact.
Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Understood. And just as a brief follow-up on the margin front to the prior question. Now that you have delivered LHA-6, how should we think about the quarterly margin profile here in Ingalls in the near term or at least for the back half of this year?
C. Michael Petters: Well, if you're thinking about quarterly margin profile about this business, you're not really looking at the business the right way. I mean, it's just -- we are not a quarter-to-quarter kind of business. We have products that take 4 to 8 years to build and we've a customer that puts out a 30-year plan. What we've said is that, wherever we are today, we're on track to get to something in the 9-plus percent range next year, and that's our path.
Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Understood. On the EAC profile, there's nothing specific on the EAC that can be released in the back half here or anything along those lines that you guys are looking at?
C. Michael Petters: We have our normal course of risk retirements and that's about all I'm going to say.
Operator: The next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank..
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This is Amit Mehrotra here for Myles Walton. First question is just on the update on Avondale that was provided last month. I'm sure there's not a whole lot you guys can offer given the study is ongoing, but maybe you can give us some color on just how you're thinking about the scope of the company's potential participation. Is there potentially completely new business opportunity there for the company or is there something more -- actually less capital intensive like a lease? Can you just offer some thoughts there on how you're thinking about?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think the first thing is, obviously, Kinder Morgan is a very credible partner to be working on this with. These are folks who have of a wide range of interest and capabilities. And so they clearly bring a very wide aperture to possibilities around that site. And we're open to that. And so the point of this is to actually try to turn over. As we said all along, we want to turn over every rock and see what we can find. Our effort to do that now is really with Kinder Morgan, and we'll see where it takes us over the next several months.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And if you were to find an alternative for the shipyard, how would that impact the recoverability of the closure cost? And I guess the most relevant with respect to that is the costs that are already capitalized. Can you just offer some help there in terms of how we can think about that?
C. Michael Petters: Yes, I'll let Barbara answer that.
Barbara A. Niland: Okay, sure. The resuming capital cost that we've incurred in everything would still be recoverable under restructuring. What would happen is we would contribute the assets into a -- potentially contribute the assets into the JV. Any assets that wouldn't go into that JV would also be recoverable under restructuring.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, that's really helpful. I just have one question, sort of high-level margin question. And I know you sort of talked about this before, but you've done a remarkable job with respect to margins at Ingalls. You're pretty close to that 9% target, and even though I know it's going to be fluctuation from a quarter-to-quarter basis. But can you sort of talk about are you still thinking about the longer-term operating margin potential of business at 9% or are you seeing some incremental opportunity given the performance to date that there's some opportunity go beyond that on a sustainable basis?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think that on a sustainable basis, a shipyard that has many product lines and many maturities has a blended rate in the 9% to 10% range. And that's my experience for many, many years. And that's what the industry has told us and I think that that's where we've been trying -- Ingalls has been an outlier to that for many years and they're moving back into that range. And we're very proud of the work that they've done. We think that's what that businesses is capable of.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: No, that's really clear. I just thought I'd ask that question. Just the third and last question for Barb. Can you provide some cash flow expectations for the year? Either an absolute number, I guess, maybe more from a conversion of net income basis?
Barbara A. Niland: No, we don't give guidance on our cash unit. And part of it is because of the lumpiness, and I know you don't like that word, but a lot of it has to do with timing of collections at the end of the year. So if I gave you a pinpoint number and I miss collections by 1 day and I can be off $200 million on 1 day collection. So not going to provide that.
Operator: The next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Barb, I wanted to pursue the cash flow from a different angle. I mean the free cash flow conversion last year was pretty poor, like 37%. And I know you're talking to K about a lot of it being higher pension contribution. But the thing that has struck me is you've also seen a big increase in receivables, up $176 million in Q1, up $218 million last, last year. So if you could pursue a little bit more what's causing that because I also know in the K you mentioned that some of these receivables aren't collected until '15, some more not until '16. So if you just kind of explain what's going on there.
Barbara A. Niland: Sure, no problem. So, George, down at Ingalls, our contracts have retention clauses. So it's not performance related, it's just part of the contract. And depending on what ship, the retention clause calls for 1.5% to 7% of billings to be withheld on your contracts. So for example, LHA-6, the retentions on LHA-6 got to be about $200 million. And so until you deliver those ships, those high retentions aren't released yet. So you'll start seeing a little bit of that change, and in addition to that, you have some pressure related to Gulfport closure that you're not billing. And you have pressure related to issues from Katrina that we still haven't resolved, that we're not billing some of the rates. So those are the types of things that you're seeing. But the biggest drivers in the end are really just AR timing.
George Shapiro: When you say like in the K that you'll get $150 million of receivables in '16, that's when whatever ship that's related to where you -- withholding these billings gets delivered?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes, yes. But -- and it's constant pressure though because as the ships are maturing, those retentions increase. So part of shipbuilding.
George Shapiro: So over time, we'd expect this disparity between cash and receivable or a weaker free cash flow conversion to continue effectively?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, I think 2 things will happen, George, and I've said that before. As we resolve restructuring, as we resolve Gulfport, and we resolve Katrina issues, and I expect them to make significant progress by next year, that all that will come out of AR. And so you'll see a pickup there. So I've been saying that, I've said it last year, in 2015, you'll see some improvements there.
George Shapiro: And one last thing on that. Could you provide the cash reimbursement you are expecting this year?
Barbara A. Niland: The cash reimbursement on -- for the pension side.
George Shapiro: Right.
Barbara A. Niland: Lets see, I cannot remember that number off the tip of my head, and I'll have to get that for you.
Operator: The next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm interested in the Ohio-class replacement. You've been a GD contract, but as you look forward, I don't know if you have -- what extent you're involved in it today, but do you see a likely path here that this could come out to be something like Virginia-class, that it could be good contract ultimately when it goes into production. And so what's the path on that?
C. Michael Petters: Thanks, Doug. I'm not sure that there is a path at this point yet. I think that the best way to think about Ohio replacement program and the industry is that today, there is a submarine industrial base comprised of our friends at Electric Boat and the folks here at Newport News and all of the suppliers that are out there. Today, we are supporting the Virginia-class program. At some point in the future, that submarine industrial base will be supporting the Ohio replacement program and the Virginia-class program. And I think there's going to be a lot of discussion around how's the best way for the industrial base to do that in an efficient and effective way. And I don't think it's clear yet, whether you're talking about capital investment or technology investment or any of that. It's not quite clear yet how that's going to sort itself out. And so we remain committed to supporting these important programs and we'll see what the path -- how it plays out.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And then just moving on to Newport News. I'm just interested in, to some extent, risk profile. When you look at CVN-78, you're 75% complete, how do you look at -- and I should say, at the same time, you're being funded on CVN-79 on an incremental basis in a sense. How do you look at the risk profile going forward here? Are we heading into a higher risk at the -- for the final stages of the completion of the Ford, or is harder to perform well when you're being funded on an incremental basis on 79. How is this working?
C. Michael Petters: Well, that's a great question. The -- 78 is a lead ship. And so we have moved -- now that the ship has launched and is here at our pier 3, we are moving in to the test program for all of the new technology that we put on to the ship. The ship has come together very well. I've said it before that it's, from a construction standpoint, it's the best lead ship I've seen ever come together. But now we have to go test it. And I think that while we have a lot of confidence about that, I think the proof is in the test. And so given that, I think that everybody kind of walks through a test program on a lead ship with a whole lot of awareness of where things can go. I think the challenge is that as you're -- when you think about the follow-on ship, the 79, I think everybody has been struggling with how do you go to a price-type contract on the second ship when you haven't gone all the way through the first ship. I think the navy was struggling with how to budget for that. I think we have worked our way through what we think the risk of the test program is on 78 and how we could accommodate that in a pricing package for the 79. But the decision that's been made is let's hold off and retire some more of that risk before we go to that final contract. Now doing that classically adds cost to the second contract and adds -- you're not able to cut everybody loose, you're not able to kind of turn the entire supply chain loose. The navy's worked with us very well to try to minimize that cost. And so that's why you've seen some pretty substantial incremental funding both from a supply chain and from a unit construction phase to try to minimize the effect of the delay in a pullout detail designing construction contract because I don't know that anybody's smart enough to know where the crossover is between the extra cost of delaying that contract and the risk retirement of -- that you get because you delayed it. I mean that's been the dance that we've been working through here for the last -- really for the last 18 months. And we're going to be working our way through that for the rest of this year. But given that, we're very confident about where we are on 78, and we're excited about the chance to move out and get moving on 79.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I believe you'll have -- it's really -- is it 2014 -- you'll have more clarity, you think, by year end on the...
C. Michael Petters: Well, certainly the test program on 78 will have come through some of the bigger items in that program by the end of this year. And our ambition is that we would get to the detail, design and construction contract by the end of the year. I would say that's probably not carved in granite, but that's the plan. And I think that's the navy plan, that's our plan. And I think we have to see how the year unfolds to see whether that still makes sense or not.
Operator: The next question comes from John Godyn from Morgan Stanley.
John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Mike, I wanted to ask a broader question about commercial opportunities. I appreciate some of the earlier questions and the reluctance to talk about any specific opportunity. But we continue to see some progress with the Kinder Morgan deal. I'm just curious, from where you stand today, should we have more confidence that commercial will be a apart of this business as we look out the next couple of years? Is that how we should be interpreting what we're seeing here?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think that what we've said all along is that we're going to look for ways to achieve the full potential of this business. One of the things that we've come through since 2010 is that in 2010, we were part of Northrop Grumman. We announced that we were going to close Avondale, and we began a very detailed engagement with folks who could talk to us about the redeployment of that site and ways to go use it. We have a very mature risk management process and as of -- at this point, we still haven't found the right way to redeploy that. But in the course of that work, what we've come to understand is that we have a significant engineering capability that complements our pretty significant manufacturing capability, and the risk profiles of engagement in those areas are a little bit different. If we're able to engage in an area where our engineers can lead our manufacturers into that space, we think we can do okay with that. If we are trying to engage an area where our manufacturers are going to try to lead our engineers into that space, that can be real problem for us. And I think that in the history of navy-only shipyards trying to do commercial work, I think that's what you've seen is that the commercial business becomes a real challenge when the manufacturing side is leading the equation. It gets to be possible and achievable if the engineering side is leading the equation. So we're thinking really hard right now about how do we take better and fuller advantage of the engineering capability that we have to lead our manufacturing capability to achieve the full potential of the business. And I think you can think about Stoller as an example of that. Stoller is a company that has tremendous access to a couple of dozen DOE sites. We have tremendous depth of capability with no access. The marriage of Stoller to our engineering and technical support at Newport News creates potential for us in a space that we were not in before. We were there but we were not able to really break through. And so we're excited about that possibility. If we can find other opportunities in other spaces where we can do things like that, we will seriously consider it. And I think you see in our industry today, I think you see everybody wrestling with how do we create growth in an environment where the Pentagon is not advertising a lot of growth. Some folks are talking about international, we're not talking about international. Some folks are talking about commercializing and leading, we are cautious about that, but we do believe that there are some things that we can do and some customers that we can engage with that would enhance the value of this business. And so we're going to keep our eyes open for that moving forward.
John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's very helpful. And when we define commercial broadly to include shipbuilding, energy and any other opportunity, how do we or how should we think about capital allocation in that context, investments in potential commercial opportunities over the next few years versus maybe rising capital returns?
C. Michael Petters: I think it just depends on the opportunity at this point. Again, we're interested in the access to the markets and bringing the depth of our capability towards that. Depending on a particular opportunity, we would then take a hard look at whether that capital investment made sense or not.
Operator: The next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a couple of quick ones. Mike, with respect to the post delivery work, I think you mentioned on LHA-6, can you just kind of give us some color on the scope of that and if that has any kind of implications for risk or risk retirements?
C. Michael Petters: No. This is just routine. After we deliver the ship to the navy, the navy will -- they actually -- the crew will work the ship, take ownership of it, if you will. And it's just -- it's kind of the normal course of business that -- we stay engaged with them because as they come on board the ship and they -- kind of like when you move into your new home and they find that something is not the way they would like to have it or they figure out something, we're right there to support it. But there is no issues along those lines. This is just a normal course of getting the ship ready to sail away.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. Not anything nonrecurring in nature. And then on the delayed delivery on the first Block for Virginia-class, does that have any, from your vantage point, any impact on you guys or is it are you too far removed for that to have any sort of financial implications or planning implication?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think the financial implications are less than the thickness of the pencil, so I wouldn't say there's any issue there. It has had an impact on us in terms of the way that we can -- we found this issue. We're working our way through all of the other places and risks pieces of our supply chain to make sure that, in a classic nuclear submarine way, you find the one problem so convince me that you don’t have the problem somewhere else, and we're doing that. So in that sense, it has had an effect but not in a financial or operating way.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Okay, great. And lastly, Barb, on the pension mortality comment you made, is there anyway you can help us sort of conceptually understand how to think about what some of these impacts might be? I mean, maybe comment on what sort of vintage mortality assumptions you've got baked in today or how we should think about -- how that impacts the liability. Any color you can help us with there?
Barbara A. Niland: The only thing -- I mean we looked at it and we haven't come to our complete study with the actuaries and everything. I mean basically, if the mortality tables go up, your costs are going to go up, okay? I think that everybody's in a kind of panic stage that it's going to be a big number. It doesn't appear to be a huge number. But I think what happened was, with everybody looking at cash harmonization as this huge opportunity, it will eat a little bit into that, but it's not material.
Operator: The next question comes from Darryl Genovesi from UBS.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So my question is on Ingalls. Should be -- the revenue run rate there now hold pretty steady at kind of this $550 million a quarter kind of level now that the underperforming ships are all out and Avondale is mostly playing a support role, or is there kind of another leg down on low -- kind of on the overall level of effort as Avondale eventually gives up that support role and Gulfport gets closed?
C. Michael Petters: I think that the overall I think will go back to the original issue of we're trying to make sure we have some sustainable effort there around the amphibs. And so whatever fluctuations you might see quarter-to-quarter over the next couple of years, I think the big issues are going to be how do you bridge from the LPD-27 to the LXR and how is that going to work through in terms of the size of Ingalls and the scope of the work that they have on. And so I don't know if you want to add anymore to that, Barb, but I think that's kind of -- that's why that transition is so important to us.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Yes, I guess I was just thinking maybe a little bit nearer term than that, but if that's the way you're kind of -- if you just -- I guess the way to think about it is kind of what we're seeing now is making sure that you don't hire too many people or drive the yard to too high of a level in front of a potential hole on the LPDs. Is that kind of the message?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, I think, part of the boat -- the work that's being done in Avondale, we use that as a bridge to continue looking at opportunities there and to help with the workload at Ingalls. So in terms of it going away, Ingalls will still have steady workload. There will be at tiny bit of pressure related to the Gulfport closure though.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then also, I guess, I just wanted to also ask you on Virginia-class. It's been about 4, 5 years now, I think, since you began the ramp up to 2 a year. Are you actually producing and I'll say recognizing revenue at the full 2-year rate now?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, it's hard because the material and how we buy material. So if you want to go try to do a run rate, there are fluctuations based on material. I mean we long lead material funding and things like that. So if you're trying to go in and calculate the run rate, we're probably close, but it's -- again, it fluctuates.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Because I was just looking at this contract award from a couple of weeks ago, and I know there's some price escalations in there. And that sometimes, these headline numbers can be a little bit misleading. But if I just take that $18 billion RSO award for 10 boats at 2 a year and say your 50% share of that should be about $1.8 billion. It seems to me based on the pie chart that you put into your 10-K that your revenues run rate is still kind of 30% or 40% below that level. So just trying to figure out what the gap is and if it might close.
Barbara A. Niland: I think you're just looking at timing.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Okay, so I guess the implication is that there's -- that there is still a ramp -- a little bit of a ramp ahead?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think trying to straight line that is fraught with some challenges, because you do buy lot of material on the front end of these contracts, and so that starts to -- that skews the program around a little bit.
Operator: The next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Barb, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the amount that you're going to try recover on Avondale increased in range level, $35 million or $30 million?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Based on your lack of ability to sell some assets in line with customer guidance, can you provide a little bit more color on what exactly that means?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay, I didn't say lack of ability. That's your words. So when we put that proposal together, the original proposal for $256 million, in there, we had assumed we were going to sell some assets, okay? So when -- during our customer negotiations and discussions on the proposal, they recommended that we look at the whole -- all of the assets and everything associated with the closure of Avondale, and then we would negotiate from there. So they didn't want us putting an estimate on asset sales. So that's what we agreed to do.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up to that. Where are we in this process? You've got a proposal together. When should we expect, at this point, for the negotiation on that proposal to come to an end and for you begin raising your billable rates and recovering some of that?
Barbara A. Niland: So I don't want to give away any strategy on that. But it would be very difficult for me to predict an end. When I think that we'll get in very deep discussions will be when we finish the units at Avondale and make a decision from there. I mean, it is both to our benefit and our customer's benefit to find a redeployment approach. We all make out better for that. So we're balancing that right now. And we're balancing that in this negotiation process.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And can you remind us when the last units will leave that yard?
Barbara A. Niland: They'll leave that yard in the third quarter.
C. Michael Petters: Third quarter.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Third quarter of this year?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is actually Chris Sands on for Joe. Just wanted to follow-up a little more on Avondale, particularly as it pertains to the timing of the study. Do you expect that will be complete before those units go out in Q3?
C. Michael Petters: About the same time.
Barbara A. Niland: Yes
C. Michael Petters: It's about the same time. It's a 6-month study. And so we don't have a direct linkage there and we're not going to force the study to finish early if it's not ready. But they're on 2 different paths, they just happen to be kind of coming -- probably come together about the same time.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So if the study comes back and says, yes, we think there's a good use for this but it may take us a year to really start generating business, is it possible that you would do other support work for Ingalls in the meantime or would that not be satisfactory, would you just go ahead and close at that point?
C. Michael Petters: Well, you never say never. But I -- my -- I think it's most likely that once this production work is done, we'll be done.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So you would need the study to have a positive outcome and a very near-term contract?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. Or an approach. I mean I think it's -- that's why we don't want to try to prejudge what the outcome would be here, but the part of what we would see is a path to a market and then what's that path look like and play it out from there.
Barbara A. Niland: And value the economics of it.
C. Michael Petters: Right.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And -- I mean, you just -- in your last response, Barb, you mentioned that it obviously bodes the navy to redeploy the asset as well. Have they offered any kind of support to kind of bridge you to another use, revenue?
Barbara A. Niland: No.
Operator: The next question comes from Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to verify on the Virginia Block IV award that was mentioned, the $18 billion award. So you guys will book half of that, roughly half of that in the second quarter, is that fair?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, we'll book our portion of it in the second quarter.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Okay, okay. And then, Mike, one for you. I missed your opening remarks so I'm not sure if you mentioned this but to HASC, I'm looking to in detail, but it looked like the HASC was fairly supportive of shipbuilding. I think there was some language on the George Washington and on LPD-28. Did you read the same thing and do you have any insight into how HASC was thinking?
C. Michael Petters: Well, the political process of -- is a pretty convoluted one. We are generally overall pleased with the way that the HASC came through their mark. The process from here is a full contact sport through the end of the year. And so -- or through the end of the fiscal year. And so this, we'll continue to stay engaged in that at this point. I don't know that there's anybody who can actually handicap how any of the other committees are going to go forward. And so I think I'll join them and not try to do that.
Operator: And I show no further questions.
C. Michael Petters: Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. It was a great quarter. It's actually -- this now marks 3 full years as an independent company and the things we laid out at the beginning that we had to do. The delivery of LHA-6 is a major milestone in terms of moving down that road. We continue to look forward to achieving the full potential of this business, working on the programs that we have and moving ahead. So we look to see you around and I'll be talking to you soon. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Again, thank you, for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a good day.

With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
C. Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. As most of you know by now, we have a straightforward business philosophy at Huntington Ingalls Industries. We do what we say and we say what we do. When we spun off from Northrop Grumman almost 3 years ago, 2013 was viewed as an inflection point in our margin expansion story. And I am pleased to report to you that our financial results for 2013 are right in line with our expectations and keep us on track to achieve our target of 9-plus percent operating margin by 2015. Sales for the quarter of $1.9 billion were up 6%, and for the full year, were up 2% to $6.8 billion. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter at our Ingalls segment improved by 73 basis points to 6%, continuing a trend of improving performance, while our Newport News segment continued to deliver solid performance at 9.1% for the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.66 for the quarter and $5.36 for 2013, up significantly over last year. Additionally, during 2013, we increased our backlog by 16% to $18 billion, of which $12 billion is funded. Our entire team has remained focused on safety, quality, cost and schedule, and achieved several significant milestones during the year, including: Delivery of the submarine Minnesota 11 months early; delivery of the amphibious transport dock, Somerset, the last Navy ship to be built at our Avondale Shipyard; and the redelivery of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, following its mid-life refueling and complex overhaul, enabling it to serve our country for another 25 years. In recognition of our solid financial performance, we doubled our quarterly cash dividend to $0.20 per share and doubled our stock repurchase program to $300 million, demonstrating our commitment to return cash to shareholders as a part of a balanced cash deployment strategy. To position the business for the future, we continue to take steps to capture the full potential of the business by leveraging our unique expertise, facilities and highly trained workforce in adjacent markets. We opened an office in Houston to pursue engineering and modular construction work in the energy industry. We began 2014 with the acquisition of the S.M. Stoller Corporation, a leading provider of technical, environmental, ecological waste management, remediation and consultation services to private sector companies and the U.S. government. And most recently, Newport News Shipbuilding opened a business development office in Aiken, South Carolina, where a company joint venture already manages the Savannah River nuclear site, to pursue additional work in the Department of Energy and commercial nuclear markets. To strengthen the skills of our workforce, we opened brand-new, state-of-the-art apprentice facilities in Virginia and Mississippi. These schools, built through public-private partnerships, are critical elements of our workforce development strategy and our commitment to improving educational opportunities in the communities where we do business. While the budget process in Washington, D.C. has been a bit challenging at times, we are pleased with the outcomes for our programs in the 2014 budget. As the 2015 budget is being evaluated, our team remains engaged with Navy and congressional leadership and our suppliers to ensure that potential implications to the industrial base, our workforce and other programs are communicated and understood. Now, I will hit a few highlights of our major programs, beginning with Ingalls. LPD-25 Somerset sailed away on February 3, marking the end of Navy ship deliveries at our Avondale facility. I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the efforts of the shipbuilders that built this ship. In spite of the impending closure of the facility, they remain focused on the task at hand, and by all accounts, delivered the best LPD to date. Moving to the other amphibious ships under construction, LPD-26 is over 75% erected, as it progresses through the unit manufacturing and erection phases of construction. And LPD-27 continues to progress through the shop and unit manufacturing phases of construction. LHA-6 America successfully completed acceptance trials in early February. To accommodate dry docking and underwater paint system repairs that were originally planned to be accomplished after delivery, we now anticipate delivery in April, with no impact to our cost to complete the ship. LHA-7 Tripoli continues to make steady progress and is preparing for its keel-laying event in March. In the National Security Cutter program, we continue to capture the benefits of serial production, as NSC-4 Hamilton completed waterborne shaft alignment and is progressing toward delivery to the Coast Guard later this year. NSC-5 James is preparing for launch in the second quarter. NSC-6 Munro, early fabrication is progressing well and we are continuing to purchase long lead-time material for NSC-7 Kimball. On the DDG-51 program, DDG-113 John Finn is progressing through the unit manufacturing and erection phases of construction and remains on track to be delivered to the Navy in 2016. Early fabrication work in the shops on Ingalls' 30th Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, DDG-114 Ralph Johnson, is progressing. And we are preparing for construction to begin in the fall on DDG-117 Paul Ignatius, the first of the 5-ship competitive contract award we received last year. Procurement of long lead-time material to support construction of the other 4 ships under that contract is also underway. Regarding the DDG-1001, we will deliver the deck house from our Gulfport facility in the second quarter. As discussed during our Q3 earnings call, following completion of this work and the composite masts for LPDs 26 and 27, we will proceed with the shutdown of the Gulfport facility. At Avondale, we will be continuing unit construction for LPD-27 through the third quarter of 2014. With regards to redeployment opportunities for this facility, we still have not found a project that meets our requirements, but we continue to evaluate potential opportunities, including those in the energy market. However, let me remind everyone that if we are unsuccessful in these efforts, we will proceed with our plan of record and close the facility. Now turning to Newport News. CVN-78 Ford has moved into our final outfitting phase, following a successful christening and launch at the end of last year. All of the ship's 622 tanks have been coated, over 6 million feet of approximately 10 million feet of cable has been pulled, and waterborne alignment of the catapults is being performed. Delivery of this first-in-class ship remains on track for 2016. CVN-79 Kennedy continues with engineering and design, material procurement and advanced unit construction activities under the construction preparation contract. Award of the detailed design and construction contract is expected later this year. In submarines, we are preparing for achievement of pressure haul complete in the first quarter on SSN-785 John Warner, our first Block III delivery boat. We expect the award of a Block IV contract for up to 10 additional submarines by the middle of this year. CVN-72 Lincoln is progressing through her 44-month RCOH, with a continued focus on refueling preparations, removing equipment for refurbishment and haul and tank work to support undocking in the third quarter. CVN-65 Enterprise is progressing through her 38-month contract for the inactivation and the defueling of its 8 nuclear reactors, with a continued focus on completing temporary systems, access cuts and personnel training and qualification. In closing, let me congratulate all of the shipbuilders at Huntington Ingalls Industries on a job well done in 2013. Their efforts this past year, and frankly, over the past 3 years, have allowed us to do what we said we would do and meet the financial targets we communicated to the investment community at the time of the spinoff. I am extremely pleased with where we are, and I am confident in our ability to stay the course towards 9-plus percent margins in 2015. That concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barbara A. Niland: Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, I'm going to focus my discussion on key highlights from the fourth quarter and year-end results. I will also provide some information on our outlook for 2014. Please refer to the slides posted on our website for more information. Before we get into the detail, during last quarter's call, we discussed hurricane insurance recoveries and the Gulfport closure that had a significant impact on sales and the operating margin at our Ingalls segment. We had additional adjustments in the fourth quarter related to the hurricane insurance proceeds. These fourth quarter adjustments were refinements of our estimate, not changes in our position on the accounting treatment. All of the numbers that I discuss today will be adjusted for these third and fourth quarter events, where applicable. Please refer to the presentation on our website or our earnings release for reconciliations. Moving to consolidated results, shown on Page 4 and 5 of our presentation, we ended the year with a strong quarter at both Newport News and Ingalls. Total revenues increased 5% for the quarter, bringing full year revenues to $6.8 billion, a 2% increase over prior year. The growth in the fourth quarter was mainly driven by the Ingalls segment, related to increased volumes on DDGs and NSCs. Fourth quarter total operating income was $156 million, up 47% over prior year, which drove full year operating income to $465 million, up 30% over last year. These results were mainly driven by increased operating income at both segments and favorable variances and deferred state income taxes and the FAS/CAS Adjustment. Deferred state taxes are different from the estimate that we provided to you on the third quarter call. During the fourth quarter, we finalized our 2014 planned pension contributions, and our estimate was reduced. Since for tax purposes, pension contributions were pulled forward a year, the change impacted deferred state income taxes in the fourth quarter. We generated $238 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $97 million for 2013. This year included an increase in cash taxes and higher pension contributions that were somewhat offset by improved program performance and the hurricane insurance proceeds we received in the third quarter. Additionally, working capital is burdened by closure costs related to Avondale and Gulfport facilities, which will not begin reversing until we reach final agreement with the Navy. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $54 million and were $130 million for the full year, which were in line with our expectations. During the quarter, under our share repurchase program, we purchased over 800,000 shares at a cost of $64 million. Looking ahead, we expect our operating margin to continue to show improvement towards our 2015 target of 9%. Our expected increase in free cash flow in 2014 has shifted to the right due to the delay in the recovery of Avondale closure costs and the additional working capital related to the Gulfport shutdown. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the 3% of sales range. The increase in CapEx is related to investments in Newport News that will increase efficiency. Moving on to segment results on Pages 6 and 7, Ingalls had strong sales and operating income growth for the quarter. Sales were up 9% due to the increased volumes from DDGs and NSC. Operating margin was up 73 basis points over the prior year quarter, primarily due to continued risk retirement on the NSC program. For the full year, Ingalls' adjusted operating margin increased by 123 basis points over last year to 4.6%, in line with our expectations. This increase is mainly attributable to lower volume on underperforming contracts that we were working out of our portfolio and risk retirement on the NSC program. Turning to Page 8. Newport News fourth quarter sales increased 2%, primarily due to higher volumes in aircraft carriers. Operating margin for the quarter was consistent with last year at 9.1%. For the year, Newport News performance was strong, with $4.1 billion in sales, an increase of 5.1% over last year, with all product lines supporting the growth. 2013 operating margin was 9.5%, up 33 basis points from last year, largely driven by program performance improvements and risk retirement on the VCS program. If you'll turn to Slide 9, I'd like to make a few comments on pension. We are expecting a favorable 2014 net FAS/CAS Adjustment of $92 million, based on an increase in the pension discount rate from 4.24% to 5.27%, holding our long-term return on asset assumption of 7.5%. 2014 cash contributions, net of CAS recovery for pension and postretirement benefit plans, are expected to be a benefit of $65 million, mainly due to our pension plan's steadily improving funded status and the phase-in of harmonization. For 2013, our actual return on pension assets was 10.5%. Regarding some of the other income statement items in 2014, deferred state taxes should provide a benefit of about $5 million, based on current 2015 pension assumptions. Interest expense should be roughly $115 million and our tax rate should be close to 34%. Lastly, beginning in 2014, AMSEC and CMSD, approximately 10% of Ingalls' revenue, will be part of our Newport News segment. The change will be reflected in the financial statements starting in the fourth -- the first quarter. That wraps up my remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thanks, Barb. [Operator Instructions] Nicole, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's actually Chris Sands on for Joe. Mike, I was wondering if you'd give us some color on the impact if George Washington were to be retired instead of the RCOH, both financially and operationally.
C. Michael Petters: Well, it's -- I mean, let's step back and recognize that whether the ship is refueled or inactivated, the work would be done at the Newport News site. And so the discussion around George Washington has some -- would have a little bit of impact in Newport News in the -- really, in the timeframe of the inactivation, the RCOH, may affect the planning, although that's not really clear yet. It looks like we may be planning either way right now. But the bigger issue is that this is really a debate about how big is the Navy going to be. And interestingly enough, if you follow this very closely, you'll have a front row seat at how the nation makes that decision. You'll see all the opinions come out in the blogs. You'll see lots of viewpoints on how many carriers we need and where they need to be. There will be some discussion about industrial-based impact, but I don't expect the industrial base to be the driving force in the decision around how many carriers we have. And so at Newport News, it's going to be how much is the planning affected over the next couple of years. We don't know that yet. What does it do to the volume if there's an inactivation instead of an RCOH? I think we said before that an RCOH is about half the volume of a new construction job, and the inactivation is about half the volume of an RCOH. So the actual execution volume would be impacted a little bit, which would then have some effect on rates and things like that in the shipyard. But the real issue around 73 is going to be the much broader strategic issue of how does the nation decide how big a Navy it wants.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: But if you were to skip an entire RCOH, I mean, would you expect that to be pretty disruptive to future RCOHs, just in terms of the skills being lost?
C. Michael Petters: No, because, I mean, certainly we have teams today that are bringing new construction ships to life at the same time that we're doing the RCOHs. And so you think about an RCOH, it -- the RCOH is probably the most complex work that we do, because you're doing the defueling of the ship, you're doing the refueling and startup of the ship, you're repairing the ship after 25 years at sea, and you're doing modernization work. As far as the nuclear test program, the refueling and the startup of the ship and the RCOH is comparable to the work that we do on the new construction carriers and in the submarines. And so the folks that do that, you have to make sure their training and qualification is all aligned, but the basic principles are essentially the same. Where it comes to the modernization and repair packages, those are basically driven by the amount of planning that you do and how detailed the planning is. And so I don't see it as being -- I see it as being a volume impact. I don't see it as being any specific critical skill that would decay away and be a problem for future RCOHs. I don't really see it that way at all. I do think that you have to make sure that you keep a sequence going, because the facilities that are available to do these RCOHs and inactivations, they're very, very limited and very tightly scheduled, for as far as we can see. And so what will matter is that if we decide to inactivate the ship, it needs to be inactivated on time. If we decide to refuel it, we need to refuel it on time so that we can do the next refueling on time.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. And then, Barb, just one on cash flow. You mentioned that the working capital reversal related to the closures slipped to the right. Do you anticipate that you'll recover anything related to Avondale this year in Q4? And just, generally, if you could provide more color if you think that free cash flow conversion could be below 100% again this year?
Barbara A. Niland: I think that it is unlikely -- we will attempt to start recovery in the fourth quarter, but it is unlikely that will occur. I believe it will move into next year. And as far as the free cash flow conversion, like I said, you have to look at us over a 5-year period, a much longer period. I can't guarantee we'll have 100% cash conversion in any given year.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then would Gulfport recovery start this year?
Barbara A. Niland: We are working that to start recovery this year. Again, that has the potential to slip into next year, but we're doing every effort that we possibly can to make it begin this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on that free cash flow question, which was just -- I know you highlighted the pension piece, which looks a $212 million swing year-over-year. Can you just talk about cash taxes, the closing costs, any other big swings from '13 to '14 in terms of just cash flow?
Barbara A. Niland: From '13 to '14, so I haven't really given specific guidance into '14. I mean, we have given you what we think the pension would be. In terms of cash taxes, I really don't want to give specific guidance for '14, so...
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And Mike, if I can ask you just a question. I know you mentioned the Virginia-class sub multiyear could come mid-year. I don't know if I caught it, but did you talk about when the next Ford-class carrier timing could be and where you are on the cost to get a better estimate in order to price that ship?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. Our -- the 79 contract, Kennedy, is the one that is kind of in play now. Our desire was actually to have that contract before the end of 2013. For a lot of reasons around the fiscal issues, as well as the cost caps on the Ford itself, the decision was made that before we can actually go to a contract for 79, we need to actually have further progress on the 78. Now we are doing extensive construction preparation work on the 79 today in the shipyard. There are units that we are working, very high-volume, frankly, through getting that ship ready to be constructed. We have been working with the Navy to move towards a contract. Our expectation is that we can get to a contract this year that -- probably later in the year, and we'll just have to see how this plays out, I think. This is not -- I mean, it's a little bit hard to talk about, but it's really not unusual. This is what we went through when we actually went to contract on the Ford. The original Ford construction contract was set for 2006. We ultimately did not get to that contract until 2008. In that case, we were coming through the design, and we needed to make sure that the design matured before we went to the contract. Now we're coming through the construction of the lead ship. And we expect this contract to be, as opposed to the cost-type contract that we have on Ford, we expect the contract to be a price-type contract on the Kennedy. And so everybody, the Navy and the company, everybody wants to make sure that we understand what the risks are associated with the construction when we go to that contract. And so we're working very closely with the Navy to get that done. The delay in the contract is, it's not the optimum way to do this. On the other hand, it's not slowing down construction on the ship today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'd like to understand a little bit more about The S.M. Stoller acquisition, and the things you're doing outside of the core Navy shipbuilding business. As -- I mean, we're looking ahead at quite a bit of cash generation over the next few years. And can you give us a sense of the scale of effort that you're undertaking, or if you are diversifying into new areas? And sort of at what scale this is? And how much cash might end up going into something outside of the core?
C. Michael Petters: Well, without trying to predict any certain amount, what I would say is that we're taking a hard look at what our capabilities are and what are the markets that we think we can address those capabilities to. We are a company that has a very strong engineering background. We're very solid in managing a very deep and expensive supply chain and we have a long history of doing modular manufacturing construction. We have already, before the Stoller acquisition, we had already formed a partnership with Fleur to operate at the Savannah River nuclear site, and that's been going on for several years. We have explored partnerships with other firms in pursuit of potential opportunities in the DOE space. Because, quite frankly, that's one of our key areas of capability. We do very solid -- we're best in class when it comes to nuclear operations. And so there are a lot of companies out there that have wanted us to be part of their teams for different opportunities. In the course of that effort, we found ourselves partnering with S.M. Stoller on a number of different occasions and meeting with them and finding that they have a set of skills that are very complementary to us. One of the things that I like the most about this company is that they have a customer intimacy that we would take, frankly, years to develop. They're located in dozens of sites around the country for the DOE. And I liken that to our operation in the Navy side at AMSEC, where AMSEC has a couple of dozen offices around the world. Wherever the Navy is, that's where AMSEC is. While wherever the DOE is, it seems that Stoller is there as well. And this is an opportunity for us to work with them to leverage the unique capabilities that we have to better address the DOE space. Going forward, it is my view that we have some unique capabilities to offer to other customers. And we have talked pretty extensively about we do think that we can bring our engineering skill set and our modular construction skill set, we can successfully deploy that towards the oil and gas sector, so we've opened an office in Houston to do that. And we are taking a hard look at how do we take advantage of our skill sets, who do we partner with, and how do we do that in a way that is moderate risk, but has a great chance to be successful. And so we'll continue to evolve. I don't see this as being something that's going to double the size of the company in a year. I see this as being something that's going to evolve over time. And as we build a record of success, we can -- just like we've done over the last 3 years since the spin, but in the last 6 years since Barb and I first got responsibility for all of shipbuilding, we have evolved the business to a place where we're ready to go and achieve more of our full potential. So this is a walk down a path to see how do we redeploy the tremendous capabilities that we have.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I know you're well aware of the risks associated with diversification from defense-oriented businesses. And it's just something that, I think, if there's a way to describe sort of the scale of this activity and how you would minimize the risk, and I think that will be very important for people to understand here. I mean, it just -- it tends to raise a red flag, and so I'm just trying to get an idea from you about what that path will look like and how people who own the stock for Navy shipbuilding and what that -- and the potential that has, can get comfortable with this as a use of cash?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think that, Doug, the challenge that I would suggest that every defense company is dealing with today is how to, in this environment, how do you articulate the way that you're going to grow the value of your business. A lot of the companies, as I look around, I see that -- and hear that they're talking about international opportunities or commercialization of products and those kinds of things. We don't really believe that international is a really solid way for us to try to enhance the value of this business. But we do have 5,000 engineers and designers in this company. We are an engineering company, and engineering is a great way to see a window into a new space. I don't know exactly what the path will take us, I don't exactly know how it's going to go down, but I have to tell you that I feel like I'm obligated to pick up every rock and look under it and see if we can find some value there. It's going to be an incremental approach at this point, because we certainly recognize that a big bang opportunity would be fraught with risk. And if you know anything about us, you know that we are very, very thoughtful about the risk that we consider.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a quick couple of clarifications, Barb. On the cash, with respect to 2013, can you help us size what the headwind for cash taxes was? And then with respect to the pension, you gave us the net number, but I wondered if you might tell us what the gross contributions and reimbursements were behind that number and whether or not that number is net of tax?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay. So let's start with the cash taxes side. And on the cash taxes, that was $126 million, okay? And then on pension, the CAS piece of that is $227 million for the recovery side, and the FAS piece of that is $135 million, okay? And that includes PRB -- I don't know if you want that. PRB is our...
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Post Retirement, yes. Do you have just the pension?
Barbara A. Niland: Sure. From a pension standpoint, the CAS piece is $192 million, and the FAS piece is $118 million. Okay, so that net for just pension is $74 million.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then to move away from the pension, and get to a bigger picture question. Mike, I wondered if you might tell us what you're thinking about the language around a new surface combatant that the secretary is talking about as part of a smaller LCS buy. What opportunities might you guys have to play in that and what might that mean from your standpoint?
C. Michael Petters: Well, it's very early. I mean, you heard the same things that we heard. And ultimately, this will depend on how the requirements get set and how you can match up against those requirements. But we have -- we have been building the National Security Cutter for the Coast Guard for several years now. And we have a -- this ship is proving itself at sea for the Coast Guard. If the requirements align with that kind of a platform, then I think that we have a great opportunity. If the requirements align around some other set of missions and facts, then I think we'll have to take a hard look at that. But that's a platform, that's the size of a ship and a platform's capability set that we have been executing on for the last several years, and we've been doing that very successfully. So we look forward to the chance to understand it better and to engage with our customer to see how we match up with what it is they're looking for.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And one final one. Barb, you said very quickly at the end that AMSEC was moving from one segment to the other? Was that correct? And what was the rationale behind that?
C. Michael Petters: I'll take that one. When we -- AMSEC was -- and Continental were originally part of Newport News back in when Newport News was acquired by Northrop Grumman. They followed -- when we put all of shipbuilding together in 2008, we decided to keep -- to let AMSEC and Continental go with the nonnuclear side of the business, because all of the work that's done at Continental is -- at their yard, is nonnuclear shipbuilding. And frankly, Irwin had been responsible for AMSEC before that, and we just let him take that with him. The rationale today is that we're bringing them back home to where they were, primarily because the alignment between what AMSEC is actually doing out servicing the fleet and what Newport News does with the carrier support, there's a high degree of alignment there. And Continental plays an important role in resourcing the work that we do in support of the carriers at North Island in San Diego. And at Ingalls, the issue, the primary issues for Ingalls going forward, are really in capturing new business related to the amphib business, which we've talked about extensively here before. With the transition of the leadership team, as you know, Irwin is stepping down and Brian Cuccias will be taking over. With that transition, we felt it was appropriate to realign to get the priorities for each of those leadership teams better aligned with the folks that we have running it. So that's really why I wanted to do that. And I think it sets both Newport News and Ingalls up for a higher degree probability of success going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citigroup.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Barb, you mentioned that CapEx this year was going to be 3% of sales, and you mentioned that it was going to result in some efficiencies. So I was hoping that Mike and Barb, if either one of you could comment a little bit more about what the spend is going on and what those efficiencies might look like and whether that doesn't allow for potentially higher margins, either in the near term or over the longer term.
Barbara A. Niland: So okay, the intent is that they will help us achieve higher margins longer term, not near term. But one of the capital projects that's included is we're replacing very old weld equipment. And with that replacement, it will be easier for the welders to get the equipment to where it needs to go, more efficient use of it. We expect that we'll see headcount reductions, as well as gain significant efficiencies in the new processes with this new equipment. And I believe this equipment is like 30, 40 years old. It is ancient. And so it makes the welders have a very difficult time. So that's one of the projects that we have. We have some other projects to gain efficiencies on the Virginia-class program, as well as for CVN-79 that we're looking at.
C. Michael Petters: And I would just add that we do look at these projects in terms of what they might mean for reducing the risk of a program. Whether it's the risk register of a program that we have in place or the acquisition cost risk of a future program, we look at it both ways. I'm not sure that I'm ever going to be in a place where I'm going to let anybody convince me that a capital investment in something this quarter is going to change our margins next quarter. I just don't see that being this kind -- this is not that kind of business.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then, Mike, you had -- I was wondering if you could make some bigger picture comments about the outlook for the amphibious shipbuilding plan? As we move now into the fiscal '15 budget process, we had the opportunity to listen to Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey earlier this week talk about priorities going into this next budget cycle. What's your updated view on the outlook for the amphibious shipbuilding plan?
C. Michael Petters: I'm not sure that it's changed that much. We have said that the Navy's hierarchy of priorities is carriers, submarines, destroyers and then amphibs and then auxiliaries after that. And that we've described that the resources seem to be running thin at the amphib line, and so that's where the scrum is for work to go. We are still advocating that a follow-on LPD be bought as a way to bridge from the current LPD production line, which is going very well, to a future program that the Navy has identified as LXR, which is a smaller version -- basically the small version of an amphib and it's a replacement of the, I think, it's the LSD 41 class. The gap between the end of our production in Ingalls and the beginning of that program is fairly lengthy. And so unlike the carrier discussion we had earlier, which is a -- I really think is a major, big strategic issue of how big does the Navy need to be, I think the amphib discussion is really a pure industrial -- it's not a pure industrial-based issue, because it is about how much lift do the Marines need and those kinds of things, but the industrial-based issues play a much bigger role in how you think about the amphibs. The Congress has appropriated $260 million for a follow-on amphib. They did that a year before last. Last year, they directed the Navy to come forward with what's your plan for continuing to support the industrial base around amphibs. We still believe that a follow-on ship makes good sense. The Navy plan does call for a follow-on large-deck amphib, LHA-8, and we're engaging and excited to engage with the Navy on how does that program, how's the best way to successfully execute that program. So there's a lot of interaction right now in the area of amphibs, and a lot of it is being driven by how do we get the capability that we need for the cost that we can afford. And we are happy to be part of that discussion.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Barb, for 2013, receivables went up over $200 million, of which $68 million of that occurred in the fourth quarter. Now I'm assuming that's all due to the recovery you're looking forward to for Avondale and Gulfport. My question is, how much higher that receivable goes in '14, since it sounds like you're not expecting any recovery in '14? And for you, Mike, if you can just go through what the issues are in terms of the negotiation you have with the Navy in terms of getting that money back?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay, George, let me start with the receivables. Some of that's also timing on that, okay? But as far like an increase for Avondale and Gulfport closure, it will be small. The majority of it is sitting there now, so less than half. So probably in the $20 million range.
George Shapiro: Okay. So you would expect those receivables not to increase very much more in '14?
Barbara A. Niland: Right.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then, Mike, if you'd just go through kind of what the issues are with the negotiations with the Navy.
C. Michael Petters: You're talking about the recovery on the restructuring?
George Shapiro: Yes. For the recovery of the costs -- or the receivables that are there from Gulfport.
C. Michael Petters: So George, the way that, that works is that the recovery becomes part of our billing base, and it's not a separate payment by the Navy over a period of time. The negotiations kind of move around a little bit. If you're thinking about what we're doing at Avondale as we continue to think about how do we redeploy it, there's the part of the recovery that's associated with the asset that's there, but there's also the part that's associated with the workforce that's there. We've incurred a lot of the workforce cost, and depending on how we move forward with the asset probably affects the way that, that negotiation goes. I don't know that anybody has a lot of experience with these kinds of events and negotiations. But what you, I think, typically -- where I think where we're headed is we're going to be negotiating around a set of actual costs over a period of time. And I think that, that in the meantime, I think that we'll be talking about what's our rate base look like.
George Shapiro: So what's your confidence that all of what you have is receivables ultimately gets recovered from the Navy?
Barbara A. Niland: Very confident.
C. Michael Petters: Yes, very confident.
Barbara A. Niland: Very confident. The reason why it's delayed, is one, we're doing work in Avondale for Ingalls. And so that is creating part of the delay. You can't close it down and start recovery. So that's part of the delay. And then part of the delay is just typical negotiations that we're going through.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Loomis with Stifel.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Just looking at CVN-79, as you go into negotiations, what type of contract, fixed-price contract, does that look like it's going to be? Is that going to be something like a fixed-price incentive, where you basically contract, you share costs up to a target, and then have to assume all the risk beyond that? Or is it going to be a straight fixed-price program, is there going to be any cost-type elements involved in CVN-79?
C. Michael Petters: I think that the top line answer is we expect it to be a fixed-price incentive contract. As we go to the table and as we think about where the different areas of risk are, I think that the team has the latitude to try to find the right way to build a contract around the risk that's there. There may be parts of this that are not fixed-price incentive, and they may -- and I think the whole range of different contract options are available. But in the main, at the highest level, we expect it to be a fixed-price incentive contract.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. But there will probably be some of the higher-risk elements. How about things that you're not necessarily fully in control with, like technology, radar, catapult, things of that nature, would that be potentially something that's not a fixed price for you?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think that, one of the big, one of the major discussions that we have going on today is there's a substantial amount of government-furnished equipment that comes to this ship and how is that scheduled and what does it look like. There's also a question of, what does the government want to buy for the next ship? What is the ship actually look like at delivery, and are they going to buy those pieces or are we going to buy those pieces? That's all part of the discussion. If it's something that's well proven and understood and they want us to go manage it, and we've managed it before, then we feel very comfortable with that. We can get an appropriate contract for that. Something that's brand-new that nobody has ever managed, and the risk register is very high, and you have a different kind of contract for that. So that's all part of the negotiations, and I think it's premature to try to say how that's all going to turn out. But I think that the headline of it will be that it's a fixed-price incentive contract.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then you protested the Offshore Patrol Cutter award. Can you tell us what were the key points that you are protesting on that?
C. Michael Petters: Yes, I don't think I want to say too much about that, except that we view every -- we do everything we can to learn from every experience that we've got. And our view is that we want to understand this better. And so we've filed a protest so that we can have a better understanding of how the decision was made, so that we can go learn from this. And we'll see how the protest plays itself out.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: And just one final one, kind of a little bit longer term. But you've been trying to show how the LPD platform can be used for other things, like ballistic missile defense, much larger radars and so forth. Any chance that you've heard the Defense Secretary talk about a replacement for the littoral combat? Would that platform fit a role, or is it just not in the same ballpark?
C. Michael Petters: A different kind of ship. I mean, a really different kind of ship. And the frigate that they're talking about for replacing the -- or the follow-on to LCS, or whatever it turns out to be, we need to set it. We don't know -- exactly know what the set of requirements are. But that's a small ship, a small surface combatant with a lot of capability. The LPD is a platform that is fairly large. And in my view, the reason it's so powerful is because it's incredibly flexible. It is -- I really think that the key to success going forward, when you're building platforms that last for decades and you're using technology that gets superseded every 18 months, I think the way that you are successful there is by putting survivable volume at sea. I think that Enterprise has lasted 50 years -- it was online for 50 years. The planes that flew off that ship at the end its life were not even on the drawing board at the beginning of its life. But the fact that the Enterprise was large and had large volume, gave that ship and gave the Navy great flexibility to do all kinds of missions. Whether it was power projection or humanitarian aid, whatever it was, that volume at sea was very important. What the LPD brings is large volume at sea. And so bringing survivable volume at sea is something that we think makes a lot of sense. We know that there are folks who actually understand that, that does make some sense, that we have a production line that's hot, and we continue to try to work that. But it's not related at all to whatever happens with a future surface combatant of some kind.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ruttenbur of CRT Capital.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: The dividend, as well as your buyback policy, you purchased $64 million in the quarter. And what is your plans going forward with your extra cash flow? Is it going to be equally weighted between dividend? Is it going to be more weighted towards buyback? What are the plans there?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, right now, we have our buyback program in place. I don't see a huge change to that this year and we just have to see how things play out. No commitment, one way or another, except for with the current program, which is $300 million, and the current dividend policy that we have in place right now.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then as a follow-up, G&A as a percentage of revenue going forward, what are you looking at as your ideal model with kind of flattish revenue, assuming flattish revenue going forward? Are you going to have a percentage of revenue or a dollar amount that you have in mind?
Barbara A. Niland: I think it's tough to say that. I don't see any significant change, really. But you have to remember, a lot of things go into G&A. Every company is different. So in terms of thinking about that, you have, state taxes in there, you have group insurance, corporate leases, BMP, legal, all kinds of things in there. So I hate to give this answer, but it just depends, Brian.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. So as a dollar amount though, it should be dropping in '14 versus '13, logically, as you...
Barbara A. Niland: I think it's -- it should be about the same, but it really depends on what's going on.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Just a different question. It looks like the 0 margin business this quarter was probably under 10%, which would imply that the underlying margin at Ingalls is like 6.5% or so. So what programs have that much upside to be able to get that to 9% by 2015?
C. Michael Petters: So George, we have talked about this many, many times. The way that, that shipyard operates is that the 9% is a blended rate. The blended rate has to come from programs that are very mature, as well as programs that have just started. 3 years ago, we said we had to deliver 5 ships and we had to sign 5 new contracts. We have now delivered 4 of those 5 ships, the fifth one will deliver in the next couple of months. The 5 contracts that we signed, we signed all of those and we signed some extras to that. What you have to have, is you have to have a maturity, you have to have the time to mature each of those programs to a point where the risk has been retired to, so that their blended rate can bring the whole shipyard to 9%. And we have pointed out that the reason 2013 was the year of inflection was that our expectation was around the end of the year, around the end of the year of 2013, we would be pretty much through the 5 very mature ships that were not performing, which was driving the blended rate down, and we would have these new contracts. We actually don't get to 9% until 2015 because we need the new contracts to mature. And each one of those contracts has the opportunity to contribute positively to our overall assessment.
George Shapiro: Okay. I know I asked this question a bunch of times. It just seems like to go from 6.5% to 9%, where you have effectively one year to do it, seems like a big jump, but maybe it's not.
C. Michael Petters: Stay tuned.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Mike Petters for any closing remarks.
C. Michael Petters: Okay. Well, thanks to everybody for participating in the call this morning. We do believe that we have achieved the things that we set out to achieve when we first spun the business 3 years ago. We'd identified 2013 as the year of inflection. We are at that point. The delivery of America is the last delivery of the 5 underperforming contracts. We're excited about the prospects for the future. We're committed to the 9% target for both of our businesses in 2015. We continue to think very carefully about how do we take full advantage and achieve the full potential of this business. And we're excited about everybody's interest in our business, and we're excited to engage with our customers as they plan their path forward. So we look forward to seeing you all. And thank you for your interest. Everybody have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Q3 2013 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Meena, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dwayne Blake, VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thanks, Meena. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
C. Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report Huntington Ingalls Industries results for the third quarter of 2013. Today, we reported sales of $1.6 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $1.36. Adjusting for a one-time charge for closing our Gulfport Composite facility and favorable resolution of hurricane-related insurance claims, sales were $1.7 billion, up 4% from last year, and pension adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.17 compared to $0.98 last year, which included adjustments for noncash worker's compensation and tax expenses. Adjusted third quarter segment operating margin was 6.8%, down slightly from 7.1% last year on an adjusted basis. Operating margin at Ingalls was negatively affected by additional costs required to remediate first of class mechanical issues identified during testing on LHA-6 and cost to complete LPD-25. While we would have liked to have been able to complete these last 2 underperforming ships without having to recognize any additional costs, LPD-25 has been delivered to the Navy and we believe that we are well-positioned to complete the work on LHA-6 within these updated cost parameters. Reflecting our confidence in the performance of our programs and the ability to achieve our 2015 goals, our Board of Directors recently approved an increase in our dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share, as well as an expansion of our share repurchase program from the original authority of $150 million to $300 million. These decisions support our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders as a part of a balanced cash deployment strategy. Now I will hit a few highlights of our major programs beginning with Ingalls. LPD-25 Somerset, the last LPD at Avondale, successfully completed builders and acceptance trials, and was delivered to the Navy on October 18th. We are very pleased with the efforts of the Avondale team as they overcame major obstacles, including the propeller issue, and delivered the most capable LPD today. LPDs 26 and 27 continue to progress through the unit construction and erection phases of production. LHA-6 America commenced builder's trials on Tuesday after overcoming several first-of-class mechanical issues during the test program. Resolving these issues impacted test program activities, and as a result, we anticipate delivery in the first quarter of 2014. LHA-7 Tripoli is in the early stages of construction, and continues to make steady progress. In the National Security Cutter program, NSC-4 has a successful launch in Kesselring and the team is focused on completing the ship and delivering her to the Coast Guard next year. NSC-5 has over 80% of its units erected, and will launch in the spring of 2014. NSC-6 started fabrication in mid-October, and we are purchasing major equipment, such as the main propulsion systems, generators and electrical switchboards for NSC-7 under a long lead material contract that was awarded in June. I am very pleased with our progress on the NSC program. We are seeing improved efficiencies across the board as this program matures and we leveraged lessons learned in the benefits of serial production from one ship to the next. On the DDG-51 program, the keel for DDG-113, John Finn, was authenticated this week. The ship is now 20% complete, and is expected to be delivered to the Navy in 2016. We also recently started fabrication on DDG-114, which will be Ingalls' 30th Arleigh Burke class destroyer. Regarding the DDG-1000 destroyer program, we delivered the composite hangar for DDG-1001, the U.S. Navy's second Zumwalt class guided missile destroyer, Michael Monsoor, at the end of September, and all that remains on the ship is the deckhouse delivery, which is expected in the first quarter of 2014. Following completion of this work and the composite masts for LPDs 26 and 27, we will proceed with the shutdown of the Gulfport facility as previously announced. At Avondale, even though LPD-25 has been delivered, the ship will remain on site until February as we complete post-delivery items for the customer. We are also continuing unit construction for LPDs 26 and 27 that will be completed in the third quarter of 2014. With regard to Jones Act commercial shipbuilding opportunities, we have not found a project that meets our requirements, but we continue to evaluate potential Avondale redeployment opportunities, including those in the energy market. In support of this process, members of the New Orleans Metal Trade Council and the Metal Trades Department approved a new collective bargaining agreement at the end of September, which will run from January 2014 through January 2019. The agreement contains a wage and benefits package designed to be competitive in the commercial energy market. Even with this positive development, let me remind everyone that if we are unsuccessful in our redeployment efforts, we will proceed with our plan of record and close the facility. Now turning to Newport News. CVN-784 [ph] continues to make progress, and is preparing for its christening ceremonies this weekend with launch next week. CVN-79 Kennedy continues with engineering and design material procurement and advanced unit construction activities. The Navy announced that they will delay the award of the detailed design and construction contract, and continue along the planned path, using an FY '14 advanced construction contract vehicle, allowing more time to optimize the technology requirements and the build and test plans for this ship. In submarines, we continue to make progress on SSN-785 John Warner, our first Block 3 delivery boat. Given that the government is operating under a continuing resolution without special language allowing new program starts, award of a Block 4 contract for up to 10 additional submarines will be delayed until at least early 2014. The CVN-71 Roosevelt completed its refueling and complex overhaul, and was redelivered to the Navy at the end of August. CVN-72 Lincoln is progressing through the early stages of its 44-month RCOH with a focus on refueling preparations, removing equipment for refurbishment and haul and tank work. And CVN-65 Enterprise is progressing through the early stages of its 38-month contract for the inactivation and the defueling of its 8 nuclear reactors, with a focus on completing temporary systems, access cuts and personnel training and qualification. In summary, our programs continue to perform well. Our financial results are in line with our expectations, and our long-term outlook of a 9-plus percent operating margin by 2015 remains unchanged. We have achieved several important milestones, including the delivery of LPD-25, the fourth of our 5 underperforming ships, and we took another positive step in our cash deployment strategy by increasing our dividend and expanding our share repurchase program. And although defense budgets remain under pressure, we are maintaining our focus on safety, quality, cost and schedule. This drives a culture that is committed to producing affordable, high-quality ships for our customers, which in turn creates value for our shareholders and provide stability for our employees. Now that concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay, thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, I'm going to focus my discussion on the key items that occurred during the quarter, and give a little insight into 2014 pension sensitivities. Please refer to the slides posted on our website for more information. As Mike mentioned, there were 2 significant nonrecurring events during the quarter that we adjusted for in our earnings release. First, we settled hurricane-related insurance claims and received $180 million of cash during the quarter. As a result of the settlement, Ingalls' revenues decreased by $37 million due to lower overhead cost, and operating income increased $46 million. This reflects the economic position of the customers' recent direction for the treatment of insurance related costs and recoveries. Second, we announced the planned closure of the Gulfport Composite facility as a result of the Navy selecting a steel deckhouse for DDG-1002. Due to the loss of the deckhouse and the planned closure, revenues increased $9 million and operating income decreased $17 million, which is within the range that we previously disclosed. Additionally, please remember that in the third quarter last year, we adjusted both Ingalls and Newport News operating margins for $24 million of noncash worker's compensation charges and net earnings was adjusted for an $8 million tax expense related to our spinoff Tax Matters Agreement. Moving onto consolidated results on Page 4. All of the numbers that I discuss will be adjusted for these events, and you can refer to the presentation on the website or the earnings release for reconciliations. Total sales increased 4.3%, which was mainly due to increased volume at Newport News and aircraft carriers and fleet support services. Third quarter operating income was $98 million, up $8 million or 8.9% over the same period in 2012. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a lower FAS/CAS Adjustment this quarter. Pension adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.17 compared to $0.98 in Q3 2012. We generated $251 million of free cash flow for the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $30 million, down $5 million from the third quarter last year. For the full year, we continued to expect capital expenditures to be in the mid-2% to 3% of sales range. During the quarter, under our current share repurchase program, we purchased over 450,000 shares at a cost of $30 million. Additionally, we paid our fourth quarterly dividend of $0.10 in September. Turning to segment level performance on Pages 5 and 6 of the slide deck. Ingalls' operating margin was 3% for the quarter or 151 basis points higher than the same period last year. The increase over the prior year was primarily attributable to risk retirement on the NSC program. However, as Mike discussed, margins were negatively affected this quarter due to additional cost to complete LHA-6 and LPD-25 in an amount similar to the LPD charges during the same period last year. Included in the cost for LPD-25 was $4.8 million for the propeller incident we previously disclosed. Newport News operating margin was 9.1% for the quarter compared to 10.9% for the same period last year. 2012 operating margin included a $15 million favorable resolution of an outstanding contract adjustment on the Enterprise EDSRA. For 2013, we are still estimating deferred state tax expense in the $10 million range, a FAS/CAS Adjustment of approximately $65 million and net interest expense of approximately $116 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.3%, which was favorably impacted by an increase in the domestic manufacturing production, and the true-up of our 2012 estimated tax return. We are now expecting our full year effective tax rate to be around 33%, which differs from the statutory rate primarily as a result of the manufacturing deductions and the retroactive extension of the research and development tax credit through the end of 2013. Turning to Slide 7. We have included our 2014 pension sensitivities. As always, remember that pension-related numbers are subject to year end performance and measurement criteria. This chart shows the sensitivities of our 2014 estimated FAS/CAS Adjustment to discount rate assumptions and actual asset returns for 2013, and assumes a 7.5% long-term return on assets going forward. At the end of the third quarter, our discount rates were approximately 85 basis points above last year, and year-to-date actual returns were approximately 5.5%. However, actual returns can be volatile. For example, at the end of last week, year-to-date return had increased to over 8%. We expect required cash contributions in 2014 to be minimal and lower discretionary contributions than in 2013. Finally, yesterday, we closed an amendment of our bank credit facility, which improved pricing and created more flexibility under some of our covenants. An 8-K disclosing this amendment will be filed. So that wraps up my remarks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thanks, Barb. [Operator Instructions] Nina, I'll turn the call over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse.
Ross Cowley - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is actually Ross Cowley in for Rob. I just had a quick question, Mike, on -- when you think about the delivery of LPD-25 in the last quarter, the delivery of LHA-6 early in '14 and the other zero margin ships that you've already delivered, when do you think could be the first quarter where we see kind of a clean number on the margin at Ingalls without the distortions from those ships?
C. Michael Petters: Well, we've said from the beginning that the first thing we have to do is get the ships out of our system. The second thing we have to do is we have to let the ships that are at Ingalls to mature. And so our statements so far has been that we will be at -- we expect both of our businesses to be operating at 9% in 2015 and we really haven't tried to predict what's going to happen between now and then, except that there'll be an accelerating progression towards those numbers between now and then, and so that's kind of what we said and we'll continue to say that.
Ross Cowley - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Just one thing on the 9%. Is it still the case that you're expecting that to be a full year 2015 margin?
C. Michael Petters: Yes, that's right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Unknown Analyst: This is actually Chris Sands on for Joe. Mike, I was hoping you can you give us an update on the energy side of Avondale. You mentioned there was no Jones Act opportunities, but have you guys received any opportunities on the energy side?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. We're continuing to evaluate a broad array of opportunities in both the energy and in the Jones Act and we've got some pretty -- we've got our own internal criteria for what we think -- how do we balance risk and rewards in those opportunities. And so at this point, while we're talking and working through a lot of different possibilities, we haven't come to one yet that we believe meets the requirements that we're looking for. So we just continue to look at that and work our way through that. There is still a lot of interest in the fabrication potential at Avondale to support the Energy segment. The challenge that we have, as we've mentioned before, is that that work is really not eminent. It's a little bit out there, and so the question is how do you get from here to there and so we continue to evaluate that, too.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So the ship leaves the yard in February. If the situation remains as it is today, would the yard then close in February?
C. Michael Petters: No. We're doing some unit construction to support Pascagoula's production of the LPDs 26 and 27, and so it's probably later in the year, but it's definitely next year.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And how many employees do you have there now or what will you have come February?
Barbara A. Niland: 600.
C. Michael Petters: Yes, we have about 600 -- probably next year, we'll probably have a running rate of between 500 and 600 people.
Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then Barb, one for you. You quantified the $4.8 million for LPD-25 just for the propeller, but can you quantify the total amount of charges that were on LPD-25 and LHA-6 in the quarter that weighed on margins?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes, we said it was similar to what we -- the charge we took the same time last year, which was a little over $20 million in total.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wanted to focus a little bit more on Ingalls to get a good understanding of why it is you'll go from 3% margin today to 9% margins in 2015. I'm wondering, Mike, if you could just kind of walk us through in a little bit more detail, for the benefit of everybody on the line here, the building blocks of all of that. For example, the initial margin rates that you'll be booking on the ships that are left in the yard?
C. Michael Petters: Okay. When you're in a shipyard where there's an array of programs, you have mature programs, you have new programs and you have various maturities in terms of where they are in their cycle relative to serial production. You end up with -- you blend all of their different returns together and you end up at a, I believe, in a 9% to 10% range is where you ought to be operating. The challenge that we've had over the past couple of years is that the programs that should have been -- if you're going to blend to 9%, that means that you're going to have some that you're going to be above that on and then some that you'll be below that on. The ones that should be above that are the ones that are the most mature, the ones you have the most experience with that you've done the most of. The newer programs, because of the risk of a new program and our conservative approach to not booking the income until we've retired the risk, means that in these younger programs, we're typically booking at something less than our target. So where we've been for the last couple of years is that the program that should have been our highest booking rates were actually our lowest. And so the first measure -- the first thing we have to do is get those ships out of the blend. We've got 4 of them gone. We've got one to go. The second thing you have to do is you have to take those programs that are new, and remember that in 2011, we said we needed to go and sign 5 contracts, well, we signed all 5 of those contracts. In fact, we signed more than that. But you have to give those programs that are new the time and the effort to retire risk before you can book them to the place where they need to be. So getting the first step done was something that we wanted to get done. We now expect to finish that by the end of first quarter 2014. That's when America will be gone, those 5 ships will be gone. The second part, though, requires a couple more years before those 5 new contracts that we signed will mature to the point where they're actively contributing to the full 9% target that we set. Now the third piece that has to happen is that, as those ships mature, you have come back in and you have the fill in more work behind that. And if you have followed what we've been saying for quite a while now, we are very focused on the 3 to 5-year horizon with the Navy and the Navy budgeting and the future of amphibs because it's the future work in amphibs that will fill in behind that, that will allow us to sustain our workforce, sustain our rate base and help make the blended rate all work together. So the first step is almost complete. We're not going to call it done until we're done, which is the delivery of America. The second step will take us until 2015 to let those programs mature, and let us retire the risk on the new contracts that we've signed since March of 2011. The first step is something that we're working on very, very much right now. We're actively engaged in an environment where there's not a whole lot of oxygen for a discussion about something that's 3 to 5 years from now. So that's kind of -- that's where it is. I'm not sure that we're going to be ever providing any sort of quarter-by-quarter or program-by-program breakout of how that blend comes together, but that's what we're up to.
Barbara A. Niland: And Jason, I'll add, you'll see when we file the Q in our cumulative contract adjustment side, there's a favorable adjustment on NSC that you'll see as part of that. And so, as Michael was talking, the contracts are starting to mature. We're retiring risk, and just because of all the other moving parts this quarter, it doesn't stand out.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. You know what I think might be helpful is to just give us a bit of a sense of whether the initial booking rate on the new work that you'll be bringing into the yard will be any different, higher or lower, than you've historically done on initial booking rates. Because I think the fear here would be that you come in and you started booking at a higher initial rate than you would have in the past, and that opens us up to the risk of negative cum [ph] adjustments going forward. So if you could just give us a sense of your approach to the initial booking rates or the new work that you'll be bringing in is [indiscernible] 9%?
C. Michael Petters: Without going into the rates, I would just tell you that our approach to any new program is to take a look at what's in the risk register when we sign the contract, determine what we think the effective starting booking rate will be, and then we adjust as we retire the risk. I mean, that is our very disciplined method for doing this across all of our programs at every stage of construction, and so I don't think of it as we're booking higher or lower than we've historically done. We are following our process.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just following up on that question. Just now that LPD-25 is out of the yard, in the fourth quarter, do you end up getting a significant sequential jump in the Ingalls margin?
C. Michael Petters: Well, we're not going to predict fourth quarter. But the issue is the ship is still in the yard. The ship will still be in the yard until February, because we're doing postdelivery items that we traditionally do and sail-away, I think, is scheduled now for February so...
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then with regards to LHA-6 now being in the first quarter, how should we think about the cash impact of that move from this year into next year?
Barbara A. Niland: We won't collect the retention until after delivery. So it does move those cash collections into 2014.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Have you ever sized what that could be in terms of what are the ranges?
Barbara A. Niland: No. We didn't provide any ranges on that.
C. Michael Petters: My CFO continues to remind everyone that our cash collections are very lumpy, and this is an example of what that's about. I mean, it's just timing.
Operator: If we can move onto the next question, which comes from the line of Finbar Sheehy from Sanford Bernstein.
Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: You're closing the Gulfport Composite facility because the Navy decided not go with the composite deckhouse. Can you give us a sense of what the total closure cost there is, how much of it you've booked already, how much of it the Navy will cover and when they'll cover it?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, there's a couple pieces, okay? There's the part that's associated with accelerated depreciation on the assets, okay. And then there's actual cost of closure, which is severance and facility work, okay? So in our -- we said it was $57 million for closure cost and what you're seeing right now is we have to accelerate the depreciation of assets. That's $52 million, and as a result of that, you had an increased cost to our cost type contract work there, and that increase in cost reduced the margin. So we took a $17 million charge for that, okay? So we had that margin impact, and we gave you a range of $15 million to $20 million. It ended up being $17 million. So I think that explains the margin impact and the cost of closure.
Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I guess I'm trying to understand better, is that a net cost to you? Is there an outstanding amount that you'll be able to recover from the Navy at a later point since it was their decision that actually led to this?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes, it will be -- it is being -- the depreciation is being accelerated in our rates and getting charged on the last of the work we're completing on the DDG-1000 program there, and so it's being recovered in the contract.
Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And that's the $52 million?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ruttenbur from CRT Capital.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions on G&A. Typically, you have seasonality in the fourth quarter where I assume due to bonuses and other things, you have a spike in the fourth quarter. First of all, I wanted to figure out if you can give us that kind of guidance that you'd see that seasonality continue? And then I have one follow-on.
Barbara A. Niland: On the G&A, with the litigations that we've been with FM and the different litigation, we've seen a little bit of a spike in G&A. So when you think about it, right now, you're paying higher state taxes on our taxable income, so don't mind that. And the other side of it is we're seeing a little bit of increase in legal expenses that are causing that, Brian.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Is that a seasonal fourth quarter issue? It was last year, and I just wanted to understand on a sequential basis from third quarter to fourth quarter this year if you're going to see that kind of upward jump last year.
Barbara A. Niland: I wouldn't say it's seasonal. I think it's really just related to whatever. If there's extra BMP, if we're doing actual proposals, what happens in the legal expense side and then the last part of it is just the taxable income. So I wouldn't say expect that trend. We'll just have to see what happens in the quarter.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then I don't know if you're going to be able to answer this or willing to answer that, Barb. But on the segment operating margins, do you see stability from this level or do you see that there's going to be -- it's still going to be jumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on ship production and what's being launched? How do you know if this is going to be our base or we're going to see a jump up or down from here?
Barbara A. Niland: You will see some spikes and overtime. It really depends on what events occur in the shipyard, where we are and how we're progressing on each individual ship. So like in this quarter, we had the NSC-4 launch, and our performance is going very well on that ship, and we were able to retire risk on that ship. So you won't see it next quarter because there's no big milestone next quarter. So you will get a little bit of the peaks and valleys, and that's why we say you can't look out at quarter-to-quarter. You have to look at us from a perspective of a year there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So I'm going to go to the esoteric topic of pension. It's a big move on FAS/CAS year-on-year, and Barb, could you just give us -- is it $50 million to $75 million down on FAS and maybe $70 million to $100 million up on CAS? Is that what the moving parts are?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, how about if we wait until the fourth quarter, and I'll actually give you each of the pieces. What I have right now is just the net, but you're directionally in the right direction.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. I mean, it's really asking -- leading to a question, which is, Mike, when you think about going to the Navy with costs that are clearly allowable, but escalating at the pace that they would be under kind of this circumstance, how is any -- do you approach the conversation? Are you able to offset it in other areas of the cost structure? Because it looks like it's going pension in isolation. CAS recovery would be going in isolation from 2% of cost to 4% of cost in 2 years, and likely through harmonization, that's only going to get higher.
C. Michael Petters: Yes. And I think, Miles, you're right. In fact, that's a tough discussion, and where we end up finding ourselves is in the negotiation of each of our contracts. There's a pretty healthy dialogue over what are the correct rates for the programs, especially when we're in those discussions today around CVN-79, which is a program that will take 8 years to build, and we're talking about Block 4 submarines, which is a 9 or 10-ship program, which will play out over at least that long. You're trying to make sure that in that discussion that you have a good enough view of your whole rate base, not just the pension side of it, but the whole workload and everything else, the education, the training, the retirements, retention, all that stuff because it's part of the discussion. And to the extent that we're able to negotiate that into the contracts appropriately, it doesn't become part of our risk register. But when we come out of the room with a signed contract, any of those things that we think have created some risk on the contract become part of the risk register, and now I'm back to the discussion I had before, which is, okay, so now we've got these items in our risk register, how does that affect our initial booking rates? So that's kind of a process. It's kind of looking at how we make the sausage, but we are -- find ourselves routinely discussing what we think the wage growth might be or the pension impact might be inside of a contract negotiation 7, 8 years from now, and that's what makes the business so much fun.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Are you having any challenge capturing as much of that recovery as you used to through your contracts or is it -- are you capturing the same percentage?
C. Michael Petters: I'll start and let Barb talk to this. I think this whole harmonization issue is something that the Pentagon has not yet quite put their own head around, and so as more and more -- again, we're not the biggest player in this pool right now. As more and more of the folks that have to deal with that -- have to deal with that through their own negotiations with the Pentagon, I think the Pentagon is going to have to continue to come to grips with it, and so that's my observation from where I sit is that this is -- the final chapter on harmonization has not been written yet so -- and I'll now turn it over to Barb from there.
Barbara A. Niland: Yes, Miles, negotiations are tough. They're pushing back on what our CAS assumptions are for pension returns and also discount rate, and so it just adds to the top part of the negotiations. They want us to use higher pension returns and higher discount rates that are unrealistic, and we try to push them back to a more realistic position, and fortunately, we've been doing okay there, but it's tough. It's tough.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And then one clarification cleanup. The $180 million cash recovery that you talked about from the insurance, it looks on the cash flow statement $58 million was in cash investing. Was the other $120 million in operating cash flow?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes, it was.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Omear Khalid from Goldman Sachs.
Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Barb, this one's for you. In the unfortunate scenario where you cannot land replacement energy work, what type of cash closure cost would be looking at? Understand that if it's tough to come up with an exact number, but a range would be helpful. And how much of that would be recoverable if you would know?
Barbara A. Niland: So that's all in our restructuring proposal. So what we have in the restructuring is the assets, the accelerated depreciation on the assets, and then the cost associated with closing the facility, which includes severance and also things like retention for people we needed to keep to finish LPD-25 and 26 work. So all that's included in our restructuring proposal so it's $256 million, and that hasn't changed. That's held -- been holding pretty steady for the last year.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.
Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It's actually Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron Epstein today. My question is about, I guess, capital deployment. How are you thinking about returning cash to shareholders and will you be announcing some sort of share repurchase plans?
C. Michael Petters: Well, we just -- first, our approach is that we're going to be -- continue to be very balanced in this. We will continue to look for ways to create overall value for our business, and that includes dividends and share repurchase. And just last week, we announced the doubling of our dividend, and we doubled the amount of the authorization for the share repurchase. Our board approved all of that last week. So I think we're on track with what we've said our approach will be, which is to be very balanced and find ways to continue to create value for everybody.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski from Drexel.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: I got in a little bit late, so I apologize. I think you might have touched on these 2 questions already. But Mike, a couple maybe difficult questions to answer. On LSD x or LX or whatever the notation is right now, I know the RCOH wants it. What's your sense of the degree of how much the Navy wants to follow-on amphib? And B, can they fit it into their budget in this environment? And maybe lastly, just kind of what year would you like to add or do you need that to be budgeted in in order to have kind of a smooth transition from the current class?
C. Michael Petters: Yes, that's -- thanks for that. I think the first answer -- the question -- the first question you asked was does the Navy want it? The answer is, yes, the Navy wants it. The second question is, can they fit it into their budget. This has been the dilemma is that if -- this is the piece of the budget that seems to be -- we've said before, carrier submarines, destroyers sit at the top of the Navy's list in terms of complexity and priority. Below that is amphibs. Somewhere in between destroyers and amphibs and surface combatants is where the line is in terms of affordability, and we've been on that now for quite a while. The reality is that this -- and the program you're talking about is the LXR program, which is a smaller amphib in the LPD. The reality is that you can make the LXR look a lot like the LPD, and take advantage of all of the engineering and work that we've already done, but the timing of that program is already too far out. And our view is "Let's keep the LPD production line hot instead of shutting it down and bringing it back. So that means that we really need to have another ship between LPD-27 and the LXR program. Now Congress has put $260 million out there to the Navy to say, "Hey, there's something you need to do with the amphib industrial base to keep this thing moving so that we can do this efficiently because we think that shutting down our production line would be an inefficient way to move ahead. All of that is in play, and all of that is part of our -- it's an imperative for us to go and try to continue to make that happen. And obviously, the challenge that we all are faced with right now is that it's really hard to have that discussion with anybody when you're moving from -- we went through a period when the government was shut down. We're now back up, operating under a CR with a -- all it can do is reflect last year, and we're only good until January when we're going to have this CR expire. It becomes really, really hard to have a discussion with anybody about, let's have a discussion about how do we keep a production line hot and be efficient and strategic in our thinking about an amphibious program that supports the long-term interest of the country when we seem to be operating the country on a month-by-month basis right now, and that's intensely frustrating and frankly is no way to run a railroad. And so we've got to get out of this cycle of moving from one crisis to another so that we can get back to a much more strategic discussion about how do we get -- how do we do what's the -- do the right thing for our war fighters and our sailors, and then ultimately, for the industrial base.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Mike, when you talk to the people on the Hill, what's your sense that we can actually get a fiscal '14 bill in January? And if we do, do you think they might put in additional money for this, maybe transition amphib?
C. Michael Petters: Yes, I -- my crystal ball is completely fogged. I don't know what's different in January than where we are today, and I'm not sure I know what's different between -- we have this -- the budget committees are working to try to solve the budget, but there's a lot of good statements about we're going to solve this, but I don't see where the overlap is, and I don't know why this is any different than we had the BCA before. And so I'm not a political handicapper. I'm a shipbuilders. So that's why I'm kind of watching this, trying to figure out where the overlap is. I don't know where it is. It feels to me like this is going to be something where we won't see the overlap until the deal was done. And if that's the case, it may be January '14 before we finally understand where everything's going. And if that means we're back to regular order, that would be great. If that means that we have a CR with anomalies, that would be okay. If that means we end up with a CR with no anomalies and it's a clean -- a 12-month CR, that would not be good, and that would be -- not be good across a lot of programs, and so that's kind of the way we're handicapping it right now.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then last one on CVN-79 construction contract, does it feel like in this environment that that just gets pushed out maybe away, maybe to like 2015, even?
C. Michael Petters: Well, the Navy's already announced the plan to push it out and operate on the construction preparation contract, and so we're engaging with the Navy on working our way through that. I'd kind of start with, if you go back to the whole budget discussion, I mean it's considered a new start. So if you're not able to do a new start, that creates a whole set of dilemmas for us in January if we're not able to go forward, but I expect that we will. I actually think cooler heads will prevail, and that we'll be able to move forward on both the submarine contract as well as the construction preparation, and then ultimately the detail design and construction contract. Whether we actually get the detail design and construction done before the end of '14 or if it goes into '15, I'm not sure I can handicap that today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky, again from Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: A quick follow-up question for Mike here and Barb. Your question -- your answer, I should say, on the FAS/CAS question earlier was pretty nuanced, and I want to walk through this in a little bit more detail. In some discussions that we've all had with other defense companies over the last couple of quarters, it's become apparent that FAS/CAS is getting incorporated into most companies' contracts today, and what they're doing to offset the increased cost is to look for cost savings in other areas so that the net billable rate going back into the customer isn't necessarily rising per se. And it sounded to me like you're saying something similar to that, but I just want to confirm that that's the case. And then secondly, I'd also like to confirm that when you do do something like that, the FAS/CAS is essentially coming in as revenues with 0 costs associated with it, whereas if you were reducing your cost structure in other areas, you're reducing your revenue line, but that has costs associated with it. So this exercise that we're going through right now is essentially trying to keep our cost structure in line with where we were before FAS/CAS, but what we're doing is replacing some revenue streams that have costs associated with it with revenue streams that don't necessarily have incremental cost associated with it, and let me just get your quick thoughts on them.
C. Michael Petters: Yes, I'll start with that. I don't think that I've said much different than that. When you go to negotiate the contract, any of our contracts, though, you're looking at the whole package. We do a lot on each line item and there's a whole lot of discussion on each line item, but in the end, it's a total rate package, it's a total labor package, it's a total material package, and that all comes together to be a contract. And so yes, there's a -- if you're going to push the balloon in one space, you got to make up for it somewhere else, and so that's kind of the approach that ends up being taken. You want the discussions to be very fact-based, and that's where the negotiations comes in because you kind of start out, both parties kind of start out with what they wish things would be like, and you end up with facts getting in the way of all that, and you end up with a contract that's more fact-based instead of hope-based. And so that's a -- that's kind of our approach it, and I don't think that we do much different than anybody else there. And I'll let Barb take up any more than that.
Barbara A. Niland: I think that's right. So we're not treating it any different than anybody else does.
C. Michael Petters: Yes.
Operator: There are no further questions. And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Petters for closing remarks. Thank you.
C. Michael Petters: Thank you. I appreciate your interest in the call this morning. I would like to point out again that we're very excited about how the quarter went, even though there were a lot of moving parts here. It does sort of show the challenge of shipbuilding. As Barb would say, shipbuilding is government accounting on steroids, and we have absolutely been experiencing that for the last quarter. But I would say that inside the gates of our operations, things are going very well, and we are on track with all of the targets that we have set for ourselves. I'm probably just in the crowd of folks who are frustrated with some of the things that are going on outside the gate. We do what we can do try to influence that, but our focus continues to be on what do we need to do inside the gates for this business to be successful. We're very proud of the work that our team is doing, what our employees are doing, and we are delivering tremendous products to our customers and our customers are very, very happy with the product that we got. And we are -- even today, we have another great product that we see on builders' trials demonstrating the capability of the craftsmanship of our people. So with that, we're going to continue to keep the focus inside the gates, and try to influence things outside the gates, and we look forward to talking you guys over the next quarter. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Thank you. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2013 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Catherine, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dwayne Blake, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barb Niland, Corporate Vice President, Business Management, and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statement and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law.

Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation, as well as our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?
C. Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I am pleased to report Huntington Ingalls Industries results for the second quarter of 2013. Today, we reported sales of $1.7 billion, slightly down from last year, and diluted earnings per share of $1.12, a 12% improvement over the same period last year. Pension-adjusted earnings per share was $1.36 for the quarter, compared to $1.24 last year. As expected, our segment operating performance continues to improve. Second quarter segment operating margin was 8.1%, up 70 basis points from 7.4% last year. The margin expansion was driven by improved operating performance at Ingalls and risk retirement at Newport News. We received $5.3 billion in new business awards during the quarter, including contracts for the construction of 5 DDG-51s and the inactivation of Enterprise, resulting in a backlog of $20.7 billion at the end of the quarter. Now before I address our major programs, let me make a few comments on the defense budget and sequestration, but in reality, not much has changed since our last call in May. While there has been some progress on both the authorization and appropriations bills in Congress, it is not clear whether these bills will be passed in normal course or at what level Congress will support the programs included in the budget request. While our views regarding the implications of sequestration remain unchanged, if appropriations bills are not passed before the end of the current fiscal year, we may see a replay of last year's process that resulted in an extended continuing resolution. And our team continues to be engaged with our elected representatives to ensure that all parties understand the implications of any potential decisions. So now, I will hit a few highlights of our major programs beginning with Ingalls. LPD-25 Somerset, the last LPD at Avondale, encountered a minor setback during dock trials. As we were running the ship's engine's pier side, debris from the Mississippi River became entangled in one of the propellers. Now this resulted in us having to dry dock the ship, remove the debris, replace the damaged components and put the ship back in the water. Dry docking and repairs were completed in record time, and builders trials will be conducted in the third quarter, with delivery expected in the fourth quarter. At Pascagoula, LPD-26 and LPD-27 are progressing through the unit construction and erection phase of production. LHA-6 continues to advance through the test program, focusing on completion of builders and acceptance trials later this year after LPD-25. LHA-7 Tripoli is in the early stages of construction and continues to make steady progress. In the National Security Cutter program, NSC-4 is preparing for launch in the third quarter, and NSC-5 is progressing well. NSC-6 is scheduled to start fabrication in mid-October. And we received a long lead material contract for NSC-7 in June. On the DDG-51 program, the 5-ship award to Ingalls was a great accomplishment for our team, and we are preparing for construction to begin on the first ship in the fall of 2014. In addition, construction of DDGs 113 and 114 are on track. Regarding the DDG-1000 destroyer program, last Friday, the Navy announced their decision to utilize a steel alternative to the ship's originally planned composite deckhouse for DDG-1002. While we are disappointed by this decision, we are very pleased with the work that the Gulfport team has perform on the products for DDGs 1000 and 1001. We will work closely with the Navy to officially complete the remaining work for DDG-1001 as we evaluate the future utilization of the facility. At Avondale, we hired a senior executive with significant experience in the energy infrastructure industry to help us respond to the continued pull from the oil, gas and petrochemical markets in our effort to commercialize Avondale's large-scale engineering and construction experience. We are also evaluating opportunities for commercial vessel construction, which are being driven by demand to support Jones Act requirements. Similar to the initial inquiries we received from the energy infrastructure market, we are being pulled to evaluate opportunities by vessel owners and operators that need additional U.S.-flag vessels to support the energy market. Now I am very sensitive about this type of work given the scars on our backs from past commercial shipbuilding endeavors. However, if the right pricing structure and risk profile can be combined with the 4 requirements I have discussed all along regarding Avondale opportunities: support from the Navy, support from the state, a viable market and a credible partner, we will consider getting back into this market. As we have communicated previously, if we are unsuccessful in these efforts, we will have to close the facility. Now turning to Newport News. CVN-78 Ford continues to make progress in preparation for its launch and christening in November. On CVN-79 Kennedy, the next carrier in the Ford class, efforts continue under our construction preparation contract to ramp up engineering design, planning, long lead time material procurement and advanced construction. We are engaged with the Navy in preparation for the negotiation and the award of the detail design and construction contract. In submarines, the final Block 2 boat, SSN-783 Minnesota delivered in June, 11 months ahead of schedule. All Block 3 ships are fully funded. And we still expect a Block 4 contract award this year throughout the 10 additional submarines, with construction beginning in 2014. CVN-71 Roosevelt is completing its refueling and complex overhaul and will redeliver in third quarter. And CVN-72 Lincoln is in the early stages of its 44-month RCOH. And after more than 50 years of service, CVN-65 Enterprise arrived at Newport News in June for the inactivation and the defueling of its 8 nuclear reactors. In summary, our programs are performing well, our financial results for the first half of the year are right in line with our expectations and our long-term outlook remains unchanged. In addition, we were able to capture a significant competitive award for 5 DDGs. This is yet another key contract awarded since the spinoff in 2011 that provides the opportunity to help us reach our goal of earning 9 plus percent operating margin by 2015. With our recent contract awards, our backlog remains healthy and will increase when the contracts for VCS Block 4 and CVN-79 are awarded. And although defense budgets are under pressure, we believe we are well positioned across multiple platforms to support our nation's naval strategy by continuing to produce affordable, high-quality ships for our customers, which in turn will continue to create value for our shareholders. And that concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barbara A. Niland: Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please refer to the slides posted on our website as I review our consolidated and segment results for the quarter. Turning to the financials on Slide 4 of the presentation, second quarter sales were down 2.2% from the same period last year, primarily resulting from lower sales in the amphibious assault ships, partially offset by higher sales across most of our other programs. Second quarter GAAP operating income was $116 million, up 9.4% over 2012. Pension-adjusted operating income was $134 million, up 7.2% over the same period last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.12. Pension-adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.36, up 9.7% over 2012. The increase was primarily driven by additional risk retirement on the VCS and NSC programs, offset by lower volume on amphibious assault ships and the receipt of $7 million for a contract dispute resolution with a private party in the same period last year. We were free cash flow neutral for the quarter, mainly driven by $260 million -- $269 million of discretionary qualified pension contribution, which completes our planned pension contributions for the year. Cash for 2013 is heavily weighted towards the second half of the year and, as I've said many times, is all based on timing, with timing of receipts and ship deliveries having the biggest impact. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $25 million, down $5 million from the second quarter last year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the mid 2% to 3% of sales range. During the quarter, under our share repurchase program, we purchased approximately 460,000 shares at a cost of $26 million. Additionally, we paid our third quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in June. Turning to Slide 5. Ingalls' revenues for the quarter were $672 million, down 11.1% from the same period in 2012, primarily driven by the lower sales in amphibious assault ships followed by the delivery of LPD-23 and LPD-24 and lower volume on LPD-25 and LHA-6 as they prepare for delivery. These declines were partially offset by sales increase in the NSC program as we made progress on NSCs 4, 5 and 6 and an increase in surface combatant sales related to DDG-113 and -114 construction. Ingalls' operating income for the quarter was $35 million compared with $38 million in the same period in 2012. Ingalls' operating margin was 5.2% for the quarter, up from 5% last year, which included the receipt of $7 million from the contract dispute resolution previously mentioned. Turning to Slide 6. Newport News revenues for the quarter increased $52 million or 5.3% from the same period last year, driven by higher sales across all platforms. Aircraft carriers were up due to increased volume on the Lincoln RCOH, Kennedy construction preparation and the Enterprise inactivation. Submarines were higher due to risk retirement and higher volume on Block 3 and advance procurement for Block 4. Fleet support increased due the volume associated with new repair work on the submarine Montpelier. Newport News operating income for the quarter was $101 million compared with $89 million last year. This increase was primarily due to risk retirement and performance improvement on the VCS program. Newport News operating margin was 9.8% for the quarter, up from 9.1% in the same period during 2012. Now with respect to the LPD-25 incident and the potential schedule implications, we are working very hard to minimize the cost and get the ship to builders trials as soon as possible. As Mike said, the team has done a great job completing the repair. We are still working through all the details, but the financial impact could range between $2 million and $15 million and, if not mitigated, would be recognized in Q3. For 2013, we are still estimating that deferred state tax expense should be in the $10 million range, net interest expense should be approximately $116 million and our effective tax rate should be slightly below 35%. During the quarter, we amended our postretirement benefit plan, which resulted in a decrease in the full year FAS/CAS Adjustment from $85 million to approximately $70 million. That wraps up my remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thanks, Barb. [Operator Instructions] Catherine, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And please standby for your first question, which is from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Mike, just on the DDG award, congratulations on that and that's actually up very nicely for quite some time. I heard you mention that it's a key driver of getting to the 9% segment margin. Just on that point, how do you think you were able to submit a bid that was -- the low bid, the winning bid? When you think about productivity, labor productivity and the various costs and the margin aspirations of both companies, now that the deal is done, it's signed, you've won, how can you help us get comfortable that, that really is going to be a 9% plus margin contract over its life?
C. Michael Petters: Well, there's -- I mean, there's a lot that goes into pricing an opportunity like that. I would kind of draw your attention back to -- since the beginning of 2008 when Barb and I first started working with all of the businesses in shipbuilding. We focused very hard on making sure that we understand risk registers and risk retirement and a very -- and creating very disciplined and deliberate processes for that. Irwin and his team have extended that with pretty significant restructuring of the business in terms of the different parts of the cost, what are the things that we're spending money on and why should we be spending that. They made some pretty substantial changes in the cost structure of the business. It's taken us a few years to get through that, and we brought all of that to bear into this proposal. We are very excited about the win. It's obviously a testament to the work that we've done, but we recognize that it's only the beginning. Now we have to go and execute on it. And we're excited about the chance to go do that.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just on the Block 4 contract, you said you're still expecting it this year. Do you mean this fiscal year or this calendar year? And can you give any further sense on the level of confidence and conviction that this -- just given everything happening in Washington, this really is going to happen on schedule?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. I probably can't do any better than you can, Joe. I mean, we're working very hard with the Navy. The Navy wants to go to contract. Obviously, there's a fiscal process and a federal process that they have to work their way through that neither the Navy nor the company have complete control over. Given all of that, I think the discussions have been very productive so far. And our expectation is if the federal piece of it will clear out of the way, the Navy and the company will find a way to get this done.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And you mean in the calendar year?
C. Michael Petters: Yes, calendar year, right, calendar year. I think -- you have to think about, as I mentioned in my comments, the fiscal year ending at the end of September, the politics and where the authorization and appropriations bills are, the prospect for another continuing resolution, all of that, that probably overwhelms the constructive dialogue that we're having with the Navy over our future contracts. It's exactly that. It's been very constructive, and we're moving ahead. But this is all going to be driven by externals.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Mike, I wondered if you could expand a little bit on the comments you made on commercial shipbuilding and that comment you made, where -- your comment about the right pricing and risk structure to reenter that market. Can you expand on what that actually would be?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I was actually surprised this wasn't the first question, Carter. We've been pretty clear about our reluctance to enter the market here on the commercial shipbuilding side. And we're adamant that we're not going to do this on our own. We're going to do it with a partner that understands that business. But having said that, a lot of our experience in the commercial shipbuilding was driven by our attempt to do international commercial shipbuilding. Especially, the team at Newport News back 15 years ago was trying to do that. Jones Act shipbuilding looks to be a little bit different in terms of both need and pricing. And so after saying we're not going to go in that by ourselves, we're at the point now where the demand for the ships means that we need to go take a look at this. We have committed to the workforce at Avondale that we're going to turn over every rock that we can to find a way to redeploy that asset. We are very disciplined about how do we price contracts and how do we establish risk registers before we go into it. And we're going to go turn this rock over and see if there is anything under it. We're not backing away from our requirement for a partner. We're not backing away from our requirement for a sustainable market. We have gone back and revisited all of the challenges that we had in all of our commercial shipbuilding exploits in the past 20 years. Given all of that, if we can navigate a way through this in something that makes sense, we'll come forward and tell everybody that we did that. Short of that, we won't be doing commercial shipbuilding. So that's the -- we have an obligation, I think, to go look and see if we can create some value here. And we're going to do that in a very deliberate way in the way that we've done that across our whole business for the last 5.5 years.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And one for Barb, I wondered if you could tell us what the gross favorable adjustments were in the quarter and just some color on the risk retirements you called out on Virginia-class and NSC, what that related to, if it was milestone-based or visibility on overheads or labor rates or -- any color would be helpful.
Barbara A. Niland: Sure. So for the quarter, the favorable cumulative adjustments were $55 million. So they were primarily driven by both Virginia-class and CVN-71 and also NSC. And for Virginia-class and 71, it was a combination of performance -- favorable performance, rates and completing some change negotiations. And on NSC, it was milestone driven.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Barb, can you just clarify what you meant when you said some changes to the pension plan and how that's going to adjust to your FAS/CAS this year, just -- and thinking about the discount rate being up, call it, 100 basis points here today, what does that pension change mean in terms of the variability going into next year?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay. So actually, it wasn't pension. It was a postretirement benefit that I was talking about. And what we did is we've changed to a third-party provider, and we've also capped our monthly contribution for our post-65 employees. And so essentially, what you'll see -- or you can actually see it on our earnings release. You'll see that our postretirement liabilities were reduced and then our FAS/CAS -- net FAS/CAS Adjustment will go down for the year.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, Mike, can you talk a little bit about some of the stuff that's been out in the press about the number of carriers in the fleet. I know it would take time. But just trying to think through if we were to reduce the carrier fleet and some of the overhauls that you have in the pipeline become decommissioning, how long would it take for some of that to even start to affect you if they were to go down that path?
C. Michael Petters: First of all, I think this is a debate that's always going on. Sometimes, you get to see it more visibly at times like this. But even when carriers are not at the forefront of the headlines, a discussion is always going on. And so there are -- there has always been and always will be a discussion about how many do we need and what do we use them for, what's our requirement to have them deploy, then what's the up-tempo and all of that stuff. It's a very dynamic process. The tight fiscal environment that we find ourselves navigating through probably exposes more of that discussion than you might be used to. And so I would say that it's definitely kind of a steady drumbeat that we engage in all the time. Then the question is -- okay, if you hypothetically went and try to say we're going to change the number to something else, the real question is, how are you going to do that? Are you going to continue to use the ships that you have until their service life is extended? Are you going to take them off-line and tie them up at piers and have them be dead asset sitting at the pier? There's a whole host of decisions that would have to be made there that really then drive the way that the industry would support it. From our standpoint, we're pretty solid in our conviction that the right way to do this would be, first of all, keep the present numbers up and not do this at all. That's our preferred option. And I think that makes the most sense for the nation, not just the company. But if you wanted to go down a path of what are the options here, I think the right way to do this, again for the industry and for the nation, would be to, as ships come in for refueling, choose to inactivate them instead of refuel them and keep the construction process and capability alive, which -- I think that the challenge is you don't want to walk away from that. I think if we ever stop building, the carriers will never really start building them back again. And so we need to always preserve our ability to build them. So if you decide to translate an RCOH or recapitalization refueling into an inactivation, well, that requires some advanced planning. That requires some advanced thought and some advanced work. I would suggest that it may be too late to do that on the RCOH that we just started, the Lincoln. And we need -- you would need to get moving on that for the next one because we're already beginning -- we're about to begin the planning for the next refueling of the -- which would be the George Washington, which is 3 to 4 years from now. So you start talking about taking the fleet down by 2 or 3 at a time. That's a real tough situation for the Navy to work its way through. And I would defer you to them to figure out how they plan to work that through. But from our standpoint, it would be keep the construction line moving, use the refueling period as the time for inactivation. And given that, the sequence would be -- the next one is George Washington, which would be 2015 or '16, something like that. So I don't know if that helps you at all, but it just -- it's kind of our view of the right way to do this from the industry standpoint if you have to do it. We -- actually, I am a strong believer that this is not something that we want to do as a nation.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: First on Newport News, I'm interested in understanding CVN-78. That's, I believe, around 2/3 complete right now. And it would be helpful if you could describe, as you look forward, what does the risk profile look like for the remainder of that carrier. And how does that -- how did those risks impact your timing of activities on CVN-79?
C. Michael Petters: Well, thanks for the question, Doug. We are not quite 2/3 of the way through that ship. And we're heading for our launch later this year. And as you may know, once you launch the ship, that's your opportunity to begin to test the whole ship. What's encouraging is that the ship is further along at this point in construction than the last limit's class was. And so we're excited about that and what that means for us in terms of the basic testing profile that we see. The challenge for us is that we will be -- it is a lead ship. And so we'll be testing all of the new stuff on that ship over the last couple of years. The impact of that to the 79 is -- it's interesting. We all have the dilemma. I think, Congress is even wrestling with the dilemma of how do you go to a contract, a risk-adjusted contract, for the next ship when you haven't finished the first one. I think our -- I think we also are in a place where it's a question of how do you go and price the next ship when you haven't finished the first one. All of that is swirling in the debate. But I would tell you that -- emphatically, that we need to get to that contract and get underway because what we're doing now is we're piecemealing the contract. We're doing a little bit of -- we're doing some advanced construction, and we're doing that one phase at a time. That really limits our ability to energize the complete supply chain. And so if you decide that you want to hold off on signing some sort of detail design and construction contract and so you know when all the risk is going to be, what you end up doing is you end up incurring more cost than the risk might have been. And so I think we're at that point that we need to go ahead and get that contract done. Now having said that, it's an environment where the contract is not necessarily the driver. The other pressures in Washington may end up being the driver. And that's part of how we discussed this project with the Navy going forward, what's the right thing to do and what makes the most sense. We're having good discussions with the Navy today, and we're optimistic about where the program is going to go.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: But in those discussions, are you closing in on what the contract structure may look like in terms of, say, fixed-price incentive? Or would it continue to be cost plus? I mean, how does that look right now?
C. Michael Petters: Well, without going into the inner workings of the negotiations or the discussions, our expectation is that this would be -- as a second ship, would be a fixed-price incentive contract. The question about contract type really is a question about how much risk is there and how do you put your arms around the risk. And we think we can put our arms around that in a fixed-price incentive contract. But then it's a question of, can you fund that? And that will be part of the discussion. Contract type may be a way that we end up mitigating risk, but I'm not expecting that right now.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And if I can, just a quick one, on the LPD-25 issue, if we see that delay builders trials, what impact does it have on the LHA-6 builders trials? In other words, are we likely to see some -- this pushed a little farther into next year potentially and that could change the cash flow profile of this year and next year?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. There's no question that these trials now are mutually supportive. I guess it's the way I would put it. We need to get through the LPD-25 trial. And I'm -- I just walked that ship last week. And I'm very optimistic about where that program is going to be and how it's going to support us. But there is a little bit of a follow-on effect because the trials team at Ingalls is going to be an incredibly busy team from now until the end of the year to get 2 builders trials and 2 acceptance trials off. That's our plan. That's the way we got it laid out. It is our expectation that LHA-6 probably doesn't deliver until the first part of next year. And so -- and I think we talked about that last time. That's still our expectation. It's -- but we are fully expecting LPD-25 to deliver, get through its trials process here in third quarter and deliver in fourth quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Barb, on your updated pension -- or, I guess, your updated net retirement measurement, just directionally, are you still expecting the net pension adjustment to decline in 2014?
Barbara A. Niland: Well, as I say all the time, it depends. When -- we look at everything. The rising discount rate is good. And it would increase our funding status, which is a good thing. And it would decrease our pension benefit obligations. But you got to hit your returns. And I think that right now, we can look that there will be a favorable impact. But let's see what happens at the end of the year.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And I guess, maybe one for Mike. Mike, on the commercial construction, it sounds like you have done some homework already, but -- and not to bring up a competitor. But NASSCO really seems to have found the right approach in commercial shipbuilding. Is there anything you guys feel like you could learn from those guys given the success that they've had if you do go forward with that initiative?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I mean, Fred Harris and his team at NASSCO are excellent shipbuilders, and I have high regard for Fred as a leader. And he's been working this problem and project for quite a while at NASSCO. And they've done very well, but they've kind of done it the way that we're talking about. They've had -- they started with a partner, and they found a set of reliable customers in a sustainable market. And they've been able to be very successful in that. We understand that it's beyond that. It's about how -- what is it that you need to do? Where did you trip up before? And we -- I lived through the experience of a nuclear shipyard trying to do commercial shipbuilding. I've got a long list of things not to do out of that experience. Avondale has a history of having been successful in that business in the past. And the question here is, can you really put something together that makes sense? We're obligated to go look at it. And I've told you what the requirements will be. If we come back with something, it will mean that we've met all the requirements and that we're optimistic about the success. So that's -- we're in the business here with no surprises, and so we are doing that.
Operator: The next question is from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Mike, I just wondered if you could talk through a little bit more detail when you mentioned about the 1000 doing aluminum versus composite. And then you've made some comment, assessing utilization of facility, which suggests that maybe, there's potential risks there. Could you just be a little bit more thorough on that?
C. Michael Petters: For sure. Our plan for Gulfport has been to provide composite capability to the U.S. Navy. It's a unique facility, really one of a kind. We have said in the past that as the Pentagon moves to 80% solution for its programs, that we were unsure whether Gulfport would be part of that 80% or not. I think the Navy, by this award on Friday, has made it pretty clear that at least for this program, they have decided to move in another direction. And so we're now taking a look at what's the future of Avondale...
Barbara A. Niland: Gulfport.
C. Michael Petters: I'm sorry, future of Gulfport. And that's part of what we have to do now that this decision has been made. We'll be coming through that here in the third quarter and be having discussion with you about it. In the meantime, we have work there to do on 1001 that will be executed over the next year or so.
Barbara A. Niland: Right. We also have some composites that we're doing on LPD there.
C. Michael Petters: Right, yes. We do some composite superstructure work on the LPDs 26 and 27.
George Shapiro: And ballpark, how many people work at that facility now?
Barbara A. Niland: I believe it's around 400 or 500.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then one quick one for you, Barb, you'd mentioned with the LPD-25, they would be charging anywhere from $2 million to $15 million. Is there any way...
Barbara A. Niland: But I also mentioned we're doing everything we can to mitigate it.
George Shapiro: No. But my question was, if there is any way to define what would be $2 million versus what would be $15 million because it's a pretty wide range.
Barbara A. Niland: It -- really, it will depend on getting to the BT and AT and then what the trial cards are and how much work we have to do. And what we've done is kind of the worst-case scenario to get to the $15 million. And I'm sure we won't get there, but we're working our way through it. Mike just gave me the eye on. I'm sure we won't get there. But we're trying to mitigate all the costs. And we've looked at every aspect of it. And that's our best range right now.
C. Michael Petters: George, let me just add that when we encountered this challenge, our first estimate was that we would be in the dock 3 to 4 weeks. We were in and out of the dock in 9 days. And so I think that the team at Avondale that is working this is -- I couldn't be more proud of that team and what they have done. They recognized the importance of getting the ship to sea and getting it out there so we can get it finished and get it delivered. And I'm very proud of what they're doing, and I can assure you that they are highly energized to get this done.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Barb, could you quantify what the pension change means for the pension adjustment in the back half of the year and -- or just going forward? And can you tell us what the plan asset return is year-to-date?
Barbara A. Niland: Year-to-date plan asset, well, through the end of the quarter, the plan asset returns were only about 2%. But the markets have been fluctuating pretty much. But they've rebounded in the last couple of weeks. So we're looking at 5.5% return. So we're looking for the rest of the year to continue to go in that positive direction there. As far as quantifying the FAS/CAS Adjustment, for the year, our forecast is approximately $70 million. And that reduction -- I think the last time, we said $85 million. And that reduction is because of this change in our postretirement benefit.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then Mike or Barb, I wondered if you would just give us your latest thoughts on capital deployment. You've started your programs, obviously, plenty of risk wood left to chop, if you will, but maybe just what you're thinking for the back half or longer term sort of when you see yourself arriving at a place where you can do more.
C. Michael Petters: Well, obviously, as we've said from the beginning, the delivery of 25 and -- LPD-25 and the delivery of LHA-6 are the #1 issues in front of us. And so this recent thing with LPD-25 with the propeller issue is just an example of until they are gone, we will be focused on getting them gone. And so that's kind of first and foremost. Our approach is to be pretty balanced at this point, looking for ways to deploy our cash and ways that might create some value. But also, we've began a dividend program a year ago -- or 3 quarters ago anyway that's a little bit earlier than we might have thought. I think if I had to guess it back in 2011 when we might pay a dividend, I would have suggested it would have been after LPD-25 and LHA-6 are delivered. And so I think we've done a fairly reasonable job of managing and retiring the risk along the way. We're very thoughtful about investments we make in the business. And we are -- we have had some success in things that are in our sweet spot in terms of being near adjacent. We've done some DOE work with -- at Newport News at Savannah River that has been really good for us. And so as we think about cash deployment going forward, we think about, are there ways to create more value for this business in things that we know how to do maybe for other customers? The opportunity at Avondale gives us a doorway to -- some kind of redeployment of Avondale creates a doorway into what I think will be one of the key drivers for our national economy in the energy and energy infrastructure business. And so we're evaluating all of that and thinking our way through what's the right way for us to engage. Our engagement is going to be very deliberate, very disciplined and very thoughtful. If all we wanted to do is go out and chase a lot of revenue, we would have already done that. And the fact that we haven't done a lot yet should indicate to you that we have a very deliberate process for this. And so that's our approach, and we plan to get through the ship set better at Avondale and move on from there.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Loomis from Stifel.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Looking at -- on LPD-25, so if you -- let's say, no more issues and it gets delivered before year end and then a same question on LHA-6 next year, when do you close out the books from that? When does it stop becoming a drag on overall margins at Ingalls?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes. The majority of it is complete at that point in time after delivery. But you'd still have to go through a warranty period. And so -- but you shouldn't have significant changes after that. When I would say material, you'll have potential changes, but there shouldn't be material changes.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. So by -- with LHA-6 being delivered, all things going well by the end of the second quarter next year, the second half should be pretty easy comparisons at Ingalls then?
C. Michael Petters: I'm not sure I know what you mean by the question. But we -- what we -- the way the business works is we've got to let our new contracts mature to the point where they create the sustainable rate of return. And we've got a lot of new contracts in Ingalls right now. And next year will be the year that they will be maturing. And that's why we said 2015 is when we get to our -- what we would say is our run rate of 9% in each of our business unit. The big challenge at Ingalls, besides the risk retirement of these 2 ships in the front end, the maturing and the successful execution of the -- and starting really of the DDG -- the new contracts and the maturing of the 113 and the 114, success on the LPDs 26 and 27 and LHA-7. The real issue for Ingalls is going to be, what's the follow-on in the amphib business? Where do we go from here with the LPD line? Where is the LHA line going to go? What's going to happen with the LXR? All of that is really about what's the base of work and sustainable base of business at Ingalls beyond 2015. And so that is really a major focus of our engagement today with the Pentagon. It's, "Let's get to a place where we have a sustainable strategy -- sustainable national strategy for amphibs." And that's a priority for us.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then just last on LPD-26, -27, again, you talked about it in the past. But how would you characterize, assuming no setback, obviously, the margins on those programs as they mature, do you -- is that supportive of the 9% overall goal?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. And I think that we're -- we know we have to get off to a good start that we can't make up bad starts with good finishes on ships. And so there's -- you have to get a contract you can execute. You have to get off to a good start, and then you have the finish. And we've got a contract that we can execute. We're off to a good start. It's -- we've got a lot of work to do over the next 18 months or so to put those ships in a place where we can finish them.
Operator: The next question is from Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: It's actually Jon Raviv on for Jason. Just a quick question on the Avondale -- sorry, on the DDG winning bid, how much of Avondale closure was included in that bid? And if the bid did include the Avondale closure cost, to what extent is there potential upside if you redeploy the asset instead of closing it?
C. Michael Petters: Well, we're not going to go into all of the pieces of the bid. Let's just say that the bid contemplates -- I guess, the best way to put it is that we are to get this right. We are confident that we can execute those bids that we signed the contracts for, whatever the outcome at Avondale is.
Jonathan Raviv: Okay, fair enough. And then just my second question is, Mike, you've talked a lot about flattish sales over the next few years. You never really touched upon it today just yet. What does the DDG loss sort of say to you in terms of sales for 2015? Right now, it looks like consensus is still looking at flat. And I'm wondering what the sensitivities are there?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. I think we're still flat. I think that when we put that stake in the ground back in 2011, our point was that the business is not expanding and -- but the margins are. And so I think that's still our point. The business is not going to expand on the top line but the margins will on the bottom line.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Ruttenbur from CRT Capital.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: The questions I have a lot of them have been hit on. But the operating margins in the quarter, do you see a period x some minor charges where you would dip below these levels in terms of operating profitability?
Barbara A. Niland: I know I said this last quarter about Newport News, that their margins weren't sustainable in this quarter. They came in pretty close to last quarter. And I'm going to repeat myself here the 9.8% segment margin in Newport News is probably not sustainable. So you will see that come down more in the lower 9% or 9% range. So I think that's what you'll see there.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then what new bids should we be looking for that you think that you're going to be competitive on, that you're looking for over the next 12 months? And do you see that there's going to be delays because of sequestration or anything else happening in Washington because of those upcoming bids?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I'd say that the Washington scene is it is well -- has been well described by lots of other people. What I would say is that our focus here is get Block 4 contract done for submarines, get the CVN-79 contract done for the carriers and continue to work on a path ahead for the amphibs. That's our business. That's the heart and soul of what we've got to get done. And that's what our team in Washington is very focused on.
Barbara A. Niland: And I would add, Mike, it's a little smaller with NSC-7.
C. Michael Petters: NSC-7, we've got a long lead for that. We've got to get the contract and then work our process through for NSC-8.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then last quick question on Avondale, how much capital do you have in mind that you would be putting into Avondale? Is there a cap, $100 million? Or do you think along those lines?
C. Michael Petters: Well, we certainly don't think along that line. Avondale is a pretty capable manufacturing facility already. If we have to do anything, it would depend on the customer and the opportunity, and it will be very small. We expect it to be very small, very small meaning a lot smaller than the number you use.
Operator: And the next question is from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Barb, I just wanted to follow up. The net receivables are up like to $200 million from the end of the year, and I know that sequentially, they're actually down a little bit. But with the flat sales, I mean, is there one particular program that's causing the receivables to be that much higher? Or if you could explain a little bit more.
Barbara A. Niland: Sure. LPD-25 is driving that, and LHA-6 are -- is driving it. So what you should see once we deliver those ships, you should see an improvement there.
George Shapiro: So what kind of -- given that LHA-6 looks like it won't deliver until next year, I mean, where should we expect this cash flow to wind up the year? I mean, will it be like negative $390 million year-to-date on a free cash flow basis?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes. And what are usually a cash [indiscernible] through the first half of the year and turn that around the second half of the year. And these are my expectations. And you have the remember that we made a bigger cash contribution to pension this year than we did last year. And I'll get back to what I always say. It's really just timing for us. So we're watching everything very closely.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then just one other -- if I again look at the numbers, it's probably about 20% of Ingalls sales that's 0 margin. At this point, it would sort of imply the underlying margin is better this quarter. It may be 6.5% or so. So Mike, are you still comfortable that by 2015, effectively, that 6.5% gets to 9% just based on the maturation of some of those programs?
C. Michael Petters: I'm very comfortable that we can get to 9% by 2015. I'm not sure that I would completely agree with all the math that you've done. But yes, I think we can get from where we are to 9% in 2015. The team is challenged. They understand the challenge. They're working that very hard. And I'm very proud of the progress they've made, and I'm excited about where they're going.
Operator: The next question is from Darryl Genovesi from UBS.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I'm just wondering, your services business is up 20% this quarter. It's up like 16% year-to-date. And so you called out the Montpelier repair work. But I mean, just kind of wondering what the outlook is from here and now that -- I mean, is that -- I mean, I guess should that be a big headwind for America? That was the one item that you guys have kind of called out as potentially being impacted by the sequester. And what we've seen is double digit growth so far this year. So just any color there would be helpful.
C. Michael Petters: All I would say about that is it's really project by project. And we have some unique capabilities. And when in that sort of -- in that side of the business, when that unique capability is called on, we are there to answer the call. And so I think that a couple of times, we've been called on here that's kind of, I would say, out of the ordinary.
Operator: I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Petters for closing remarks.
C. Michael Petters: Well, thank you, all, for engaging with us this morning again. We are very proud of the quarter. And we're very proud of the team and the energy that has gone into the business, not just in the last quarter, but really since we spun the business off 2.5 years ago. We've made great progress. We've got more work to do, but we have the right team in place with the right focus to go get things done. And we look forward to continue to engage with you in a very transparent way to let you know all the things that we're thinking about. Thanks again. And we'll see you around the street.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a very good day.

C. Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report Huntington Ingalls Industries' results for the first quarter of 2013. Today, we reported sales of $1.6 billion, essentially unchanged from last year; and diluted earnings per share of $0.87, a 30% improvement over the same period last year. Pension-adjusted earnings per share was $1.17 for the quarter compared to $0.89 last year. Segment operating performance continues to improve. First quarter segment operating margin was 7.7%, up 124 basis points from 6.4% last year. The margin expansion was driven by improved operating performance at Ingalls and risk retirement at Newport News. We received $3.2 billion in new business awards during the quarter, including the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN-72 USS Abraham Lincoln, resulting in a backlog of $17.2 billion at the end of the quarter. And before I address our major programs, I will make a few comments on the defense budget and sequestration. The failure to pass the Defense Appropriations Bill for 2013 in a timely fashion delayed the start of the refueling and complex overhaul of the USS Abraham Lincoln at Newport News by 6 weeks and also delayed the award of the DDG-51 multiyear contract at Ingalls. The Congress subsequently approved and the President signed into law the 2013 Appropriations Act in late March, and the Lincoln has now arrived at Newport News, although later than we would have liked. In addition to funding the Lincoln RCOH, the 2013 Appropriations Act also includes funding for construction of CVN-79; 3 DDG-51 destroyers, which is 1 more than the Navy requested; advanced procurement funding for a second Virginia-class submarine in FY '14; and advanced procurement funding for continuation of LPD production. The Act also funds the cost to complete LHA-6, LPD-25 and the CVN-71 RCOH. Within the Homeland Security title, the act also funds construction of NSC-6 and added funding to buy long lead material for NSC-7. From HII's perspective, all of our 2013 priorities were supported by the 2013 Appropriations Act. Regarding the President's budget request for FY '14, support for our programs generally remains favorable. The budget request includes a second year of funding for CVN-79 Kennedy construction, 2 Virginia-class submarines with authorization to incrementally fund the second VCS in FY '14, allowing the Navy to fund the submarine over 2 years, 1 DDG-51, a third year of funding for the CVN-72 RCOH and full funding for construction of NSC-7. With regard to sequestration, as most of you know by now, shipbuilding is more insulated in the near term than many other defense programs due to the long-term nature of our contracts and our backlog. However, sequestration does present increased risk to our supply chain, which consists of nearly 5,000 companies in all 50 states. Long-term sequestration could benefit the shipbuilding supplier base if procurement schedules are stretched out and make the construction of ships and submarines more expensive. In an effort to support the long-term health and viability of our industrial base, we will continue to communicate this impact to our customers and elected officials. Now I will hit a few highlights of our major programs, beginning with Ingalls. LPD-25 Somerset continues to perform well at the Avondale Shipyard and successfully completed main engine light off, a key milestone that supports delivery this year. At Pascagoula, LPD-26 is in the unit construction and erection phase of production, and LPD-27 is on track for keel laying in the second quarter. LHA-6 America continues to progress through the test program and is experiencing typical first-in-class issues that put pressure on the delivery schedule. However, the team is taking the necessary steps to mitigate the impact of these issues in preparation for a successful acceptance trials and completion of the ship this year. LHA-7 Tripoli is in the early stages of construction and continues to make steady progress. In the National Security Cutter program, NSC-4 and NSC-5 are progressing well. On May 1, we were awarded the construction contract for NSC-6, with construction to begin in October. Also, the contract award for procurement of long lead time material for NSC-7 is expected this quarter. Construction at DDGs-113 and 114 continues to progress well, and we expect the Navy to announce the next DDG-51 multiyear ship award of either 9 or 10 ships split between ourselves and our competitor very soon. On the DDG-1000 destroyer program, construction of the aft PVLS modules hangar and deckhouse for the DDG-1001 is progressing well. Ingalls demonstrated considerable improvement from the first set of class products to the second set, and we plan to complete our work on DDG-1001 by the first quarter of 2014. At Avondale, although closure remains our baseline assumption, we are pursuing commercial energy infrastructure contracts and other opportunities. While we pursue alternatives, we are sending some LPD-26 and 27 units to Avondale to efficiently manage the base at both Ingalls and Avondale. However, as we have communicated previously, if we are unsuccessful in our pursuit of commercial energy infrastructure and other industrial manufacturing opportunities, we will have to close the facility. This is our least desired outcome, and we're taking reasonable steps to try to prevent this from happening. Now turning to Newport News. CVN-78 Ford has reached several significant milestones in 2013. In fact, just yesterday, NNS performed the last of 162 super lifts, which completes more than 3 years of structural erection work and makes the ship's primary whole structure 100% complete, with overall ship progress at 60%. Outfitting of the ship has included coatings application in approximately 500 tanks, voids and spaces, installation of over 4 million feet of cable and installation of a significant amount of machinery in preparation for launch this year. On Kennedy, the next carrier in the Ford class, efforts continue under our construction preparation contract to ramp up engineering design, planning, long lead time material procurement and advanced construction, and we anticipate having a construction contract in place later this year. In submarines, the final Block 2 boat, SSN-783 Minnesota, recently completed very successful alpha sea trials and remains on track to deliver this spring, 11 months ahead of schedule. We expect a Block 4 contract award this year for up to 10 additional submarines, with construction beginning in 2014. CVN-71 Roosevelt remains on track to complete its refueling and complex overhaul and redeliver midyear, and the CVN-72 Lincoln, which arrived at the shipyard on March 28, is under contract for its 44-month RCOH. CVN-65 Enterprise is expected to enter the yard later this year for inactivation and the defueling of its 8 nuclear reactors. In summary, I am very pleased with the progress that Ingalls and Newport News continue to make on our major programs. And while risk remains as we work through the test programs on LPD-25 and LHA-6, we remain confident in our ability to expand the margins at Ingalls and reach our anticipated 2015 targets. I am also very proud of the efforts of our 37,000 shipbuilders during the first quarter. In spite of the uncertainty surrounding the 2013 budget, they remain focused on the work at hand, and continue to maintain an emphasis on safety, quality, cost and schedule because they know that these areas are vitally important to our customers, our shareholders and the men and women who will be serving on these ships. Now that concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Barb Nilan for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barbara A. Niland: Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'd like to briefly review our consolidated and segment results as disclosed in the press release, then wrap up with some clarifying comments on pension. Turning to the financials on Slide 4 of the presentation. First quarter sales were flat from the same period last year and included higher sales on submarines, the NSC program and fleet support services, offset by lower sales on amphibious assault ships. GAAP operating income was $95 million. Pension-adjusted operating income was $118 million, up 22% over 2012. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.87. Pension-adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.17, up 32% over 2012, driven primarily by additional risk retirement on the VCS program at Newport News and the absence of unfavorable adjustments on the LPD program at Ingalls. Consistent with prior years, we were cash users is in the first quarter. Cash used in operating activities was $362 million, bringing our quarter end cash balance to $652 million. For the full year, we expect to be free cash flow positive. However, as I've said before, cash flows are primarily driven by timing of collections and ship deliveries, so a small ship can make a material difference in year-end reported cash balance. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 4,000 shares, for a total of 35,000 shares since we announced our $150 million share repurchase program last November. Additionally, we paid our second dividend of $0.10 per share on March 15. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $30 million, up $3 million from the first quarter last year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the mid-2% to 3% of sales range. Turning to Slide 5. Ingalls' revenue for the first quarter were $631 million, down 8.8% from the same period in 2012, driven by lower sales in amphibious assault ships following the delivery of LPD-23 and LPD-24, and lower volume on LPD-25 and LHA-6. These declines were partially offset by an increase in the NSC program from the continued construction of NSC-4 and NSC-5 and the advanced procurement contract on NSC-6. Ingalls' operating income for quarter was $26 million compared with $20 million in the same period in 2012. Ingalls' operating margin was 4.1% for the quarter, up from 2.9% last year. The increase was primarily due to the absence of unfavorable adjustments on the LPD program. Turning to Slide 6. Newport News revenues for the quarter increased $55 million or 6.1% from last year, primarily driven by higher sales on the VCS program, as well as higher fleet support services. Newport News operating income for the quarter was $94 million compared with $81 million last year, primarily due to VCS program risk retirement and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes also on VCS. Newport News operating margin was 9.9% for the quarter, up from 9.1% in 2012. If you'll turn to Slide 7, I would like to make a few comments on pension to give you an update from the ranges provided on our last call. After the evaluation of the recently completed Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiation at Newport News, we expect the 2013 FAS/CAS adjustment to be $85 million. We also expect our qualified pension contributions to be $301 million for the year, of which $32 million was contributed in the first quarter, with the remaining contribution planned in Q2. That wraps up my remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thanks, Barb. [Operator Instructions] Sandra, I'll turn the call over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Mike, just on the LHA-6, you mentioned that there's some pressure on the schedule. Could you maybe give some more specifics on what you're seeing there, and just how you're feeling about the situation with the accrual rate on the contract?
C. Michael Petters: Well, in terms of what's happening on the ship, I feel really good about what's going on in the ship, and we had a really good quality launch. We're moving into the test program now. Just walked the ship myself last week, and now we're at the point where we're bringing this brand-new ship through the test program to get to builders trials and acceptance trials and we see ourselves being on track to get through all of that this year. But it's going to be, as we've said all along, we've got to sleep with one eye open on this until we get it across the finish line. So then I'll let Barb talk about accruals.
Barbara A. Niland: Yes. We're doing a very thoughtful approach to how we're going to deliver the ship. And at this point in time, we don't see any issues with our current booking rates.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. If we look sequentially from Q4 to Q1, Ingalls' margin was down a touch. I know there's all kinds of mix shifts, and the margin was up a lot year-on-year as you guys pointed out. But Barb, could you maybe give the comparison from Q4 to Q1 at Ingalls?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes. Sequentially, what happened in Q4 is we had several favorable adjustments, none of which were individually significant. But the types of adjustments -- we had since small risk retirement on NSC-4. We had some risk retirement on LHD-8 for some material. We also closed out some old contracts on DDG-51. So that helped us get to the 5.3% in Q4. And then in Q1, we actually had some downward pressures related to overhead rates and the EPA indices going down on our contracts. Again, it affected multiple contracts but none of which were individually significant.
Operator: Your next question, this one's is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is Omear in for Noah. A couple of quick ones for me. Mike, just following up on your comments regarding the new business development issue that you guys have. You had mentioned previously that some newly announced energy projects in Louisiana and Texas were specifically creating some demand for your workforce with some incoming requests. Any updates or any progress there specifically? And also when should we be expecting some sort of news one way or the other from you guys on whether this is a viable endeavor for you or you guys will not be pursuing it further?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I don't know that -- first of all, the news is the same. I mean, the projects are moving along and the phone keeps ringing in terms of are there ways that we can work with you or with your facility or with your workforce. And so we're being fairly deliberate here, because we've got some scars around trying to do things that we've never done before, and so we're trying to find the right arrangement with the right partner that takes full advantage of what we do. In terms of -- I've resisted the challenge of what's the drop-dead date on this. The clock that's ticking is that the workforce continues to -- as we finish LPD-25, the workforce will continue to drawdown. And at some point, if there's no workforce there, then the conversation that we start to have with the industry becomes very different. We mentioned that we've actually -- to balance the workload at Ingalls, to support the work we're doing on LPD-26 and 27 there, we're actually doing some unit work at Pascagoula -- I mean, I'm sorry, at Avondale, and that unit work is actually helping us maintain the workforce a little bit longer than we would have otherwise with just the drawdown of LPD-25. But we're -- the workforce basically draws down pretty fast over the next 12 months. And so that's kind of the window that we're in right now. And if we get to the point where there's no workforce left, I guess my view is that we still have an asset and we just move to a different phase of discussion with that industry.
Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Sure. That's helpful. Just last one for me, a high-level margin question. It seems like you guys are obviously making reasonable progress here towards the 9% goal for 2015. If you look at beyond that, do you see any upside to margins above and beyond there? And if so, what would the drivers of that upside be potentially?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think I've said before that this kind of business operates normally in the band of between 9% and 10% over a period of time. And I think you get high in the band when your projects are very mature and you're in serious production, and you're low in the band when you're doing lead ships and doing a lot of engineering and trying to start programs up. And so I would expect that we would stay in that band going forward. A lot of that will depend on how the workload plays through in terms of sequestration and what happens with ship procurements and the on-time procurement of things, particularly -- as I've said before, I think that the carrier schedule, the submarine schedule and the destroyer schedule is a pretty good schedule, and I feel pretty good about that. I -- we're putting a lot of energy right now into shoring up the amphibs schedule, because I think that's where the challenge will be in the 3- to 5-year time frame.
Operator: Your next question is from Robert Spingarn from Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Mike, on the margin, long-term margin outlook, just following up on the last question, I think you and Barb have consistently said 9-plus percent across the company for 2015. And Barb, I think you've clarified that, that is a full year number in the past.
Barbara A. Niland: Correct.
C. Michael Petters: That's right.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: How do we think about the mix between the 2 businesses in that margin? I -- clearly, it depends on what you just talked about, the maturity of programs in 2015, so are we in a situation where we're at parity between the 2 yards? Or should we think of one being -- maybe Newport News is higher and Ingalls is still sub-9? How do we think about that?
C. Michael Petters: I think our objective is to be at parity. I mean I -- we believe that to attract capital to this business and to attract talent to this business, whether it's a nuclear business or a non-nuclear business, you've got to have that kind of a return. And so that's our objective, is to get both of these businesses up above that threshold. And I feel really confident about that. As I've said, beyond that, we've got to go shore up the amphib base. But I feel very confident that both of these businesses will be operating in that range.
Barbara A. Niland: And Rob, it's important to look at it on an annual basis because you'll have -- quarter-over-quarter, you'll have tick-ups for risk retirement, so you have different things going on. So it's very important, like you said, to look at it for the year. Quarter-over-quarter isn't really a way to a to look at our business because you'll have risk retirement at different periods during the year.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Barb, on that note, how does the risk retirement look in the early stages here on some of the newer programs that are moving through Ingalls, so moving the focus away from Somerset and LHA-6, et cetera, to the newer ships?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes. I would just look at it across all programs. We look at a lot of different things. We look at how we're forecasting overhead, what our actual labor rates are on each program and then we have events that occur, and it could be percent complete while we're meeting our performance criteria, it could be launch, it could be we achieved different incentives in the contract, like on submarines, it can be threshold [ph] complete. Of course, at delivery, you've retired a lot of the risk, but you still have to go through warranty periods and things like that. So there's various stages of testing. So we look at a lot of different things across all the programs.
C. Michael Petters: And what I would say, Rob, is that 2 years ago, we said that we needed 5 contracts, and we talked about not only did we get all 5 contracts, we got 6. We got an extra NSC contract in there that wasn't on our first list. All of those contracts, at the early stages, are performing in the range of where we want them to perform to support our long-term objectives. Every single one of those programs is where we want it to be.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And just as a final question, on sequester and to the extent that you have some maintenance exposure or short-cycle exposures here and there in the business, if we end up with this $41 billion coming home, so to speak, we're -- and at what magnitude might you see some impact in '13 and '14?
C. Michael Petters: If there is any impact, it's going to be in our AMSE business, I believe, or maybe a little bit of Continental in San Diego. But in the grand scheme of things, we expect that to be relatively minor to the overall size of the business.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And is that next year, because you're largely booked through in those businesses for this year?
C. Michael Petters: I think it's still -- it's mostly next year, because we don't know where next year is going right now. I think there's still decisions to be made about this year. So I feel pretty good about where we are this year, and I think that we may have a nick here or there. But I think that it's -- again, this is such a small piece of our overall business that, at the macro level, it's not something that is driving us at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I wanted to see if we could we get a better understanding of this -- of the amphib outlook and there's -- and once you get past LPD-27, how are you thinking about this portion of the business? I know that we're looking -- at least in the current shipbuilding plant that I've seen, we're looking at LX off in the future and no more LPDs. What do you see happening here? And now does that affect the way you manage that business?
C. Michael Petters: Well, we're advocating that -- and first of all, I think you're looking at exactly the same things we are. There's LXR program out there that's fairly far away. And there's LHA-8, which is a follow-on to LHA-7, which is very important to us. But our view is that there are ways to be creative here that can actually be more efficient for the taxpayers, the Navy and the Marine Corps and also support our objectives. So trying to move those programs around or bridge from the program that we have, the LPD program that we have to a future LX program, is something that we're advocating very loudly. We've been proposing that you could use the LPD haul [ph] for a variety of missions besides just LPDs, and so we're taking that case forward. And if you go and look at the Appropriations Bill, there was money set aside in the '13 budget to go down that path. Whether it's a transition ship or a bridge ship from an LPD program to an LX program, we've got the kind of work our way through that. But the Congress believes that you can't just stop building amphibs and then restart it. That's what the law says. So we're engaged in that process in a very robust way. I'm not sure -- because of the way we're pushing on this, I'm not sure I can actually predict exactly how it's going to turn out. But I do feel pretty good about the reception that we're getting and the traction that we're getting because I think everybody now understand that when you stop a shipbuilding production line, it becomes very expensive to restart it. And so folks are trying to find a way to -- in this environment, it's not easy, but to try to find a way to get us from where we are today to where we want to be the future.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And if you overlay the budget situation, sequestration and the potential for future automatic cuts on this, I mean, right now, you've got a lot -- you did well, I would say, in the '13 budget. You've got a lot of contracts in place for shipbuilding. But when you look out, if we have a next year of, say, automatic cuts, are you looking at some risk there on the construction side of the business, not deplete [ph] support?
C. Michael Petters: I think it's really just about timing, Doug. I mean, once we have the contract, I don't believe there's any -- there's not going to be any movement to go back in and try to adjust the contract based on anything that happened. So it's a matter of what's the timing of the ships and what's the timing of the contracts. I've described to some folks that, as I've said before, I believe carrier submarines and destroyers are pretty solid. I mean, those are the Navy's priorities, the Navy has a really good understanding of the symbiotic relationship between those high-performance platforms and the industrial base required to support that. And I believe the Congress does, too. And in fact, the Navy went forward and -- to the Congress, and the Congress has expressed their desire to add a destroyer and add a submarine to what the Navy requested. So I think those programs are going to continue along on the path, basically, that's been laid out. But I think when you drop below those 3 programs and -- let's set ORP off to the side here, because I think ORP ends up in that -- it becomes the fourth of those programs. But you set the rest of those -- you take the rest of the Navy programs and the amount of money the Navy has, I think there's going to be, I've called it a scrum, for lack of any other word, but it's going to be a scrum to try to figure out how do you sort through this so that you get the most capability of -- at sea the dollars that you have. We believe that you're going to be going into that decision with mature designs, not new designs, and we believe that volume at sea is going to be an important discriminator. So that's why we've been pushing hard on the LPD haul [ph] form as a mature design with an opportunity for putting volume at sea to support a variety of missions. And we're getting good reception with that. I'm not sure how the scrum all plays out, but it is something that we're very focused on.
Operator: Your next question comes, this one comes from Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Guys, I wanted just to follow up again on the 9% margin rate goal by 2015. I'm just wondering, with the 2 problem ships delivering later this year, or expected 2, why wouldn't you be able to hit the 9% goal in 2014? Is it an extra volume issue? Or is there something else? Can you just add a little color there?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. I mean, we've said this before that what we have to do is, when we have new programs, we put all of the risk that we are aware of in the risk register, and then as the program matures, we retire that risk. The new programs that we signed after we spun 2 years ago won't be mature enough in 2014 to get us to the point where -- and we just need the time to let those programs mature to the point where we can get Ingalls up into the band in 2015. It's that simple, really.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Understood, understood. And then in the quarter, on the Virginia risk retirement and the contract change, can you quantify us -- for us the cum catch-up on the VCS in the quarter, and then maybe give us the net cum catch-up for the quarter also?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay. We don't break it down individually by program. But when I look at gross favorable adjustments for the quarter, it was $45 million, and it was primarily risk retirement on Virginia class, as well as contract adjudication of a bunch of changes. But there was also some CVN-71 risk retirement as we're winding down on that ship. So that was the primary drivers in the $45 million. And then we had $15 million of cumulative unfavorable adjustments, and that was kind of across-the-board, and it was all related to downward pressure on overhead rates, as well as the change in the escalation indices. So nothing individually significant, just all across-the-board, both at Ingalls and Newport News. And that's $3 million favorable adjustments.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then last one, Mike, the Navy going to Congress and asked for an increase in cost of the Ford, I think, a 9% increase. Any expectations in terms of Congress not approving that? And is that sort of in line with your expectations and planning?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I'm not going to try to predict what the Congress will do. They will certainly want to understand the issue, and we're prepared to walk through all of it with the Navy. This is, as we've talked about before, the Ford is a lead ship and we're going through. While I still insist that this is the best lead ship I've seen come together, there are going to be -- we're going to be taking it to launch. We don't want to launch it until it's ready to be launched just to make sure that we retire as much risk and do this as efficiently as we possibly can. I do expect that ultimately, that the request will be honored and that we'll move ahead, and that's certainly a part of our financial plan going forward, and frankly, what it will take to get that ship delivered. So it's part of the process. It's a healthy process. I believe the Congress will give it a full review. And after they've given it a full review, they'll come to the same conclusions that we have.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citibank.
Jonathan Raviv: It's Jon Raviv for Jason. Just following up on Pete's question about Newport News margins. Mike, you talk about the business being 9% to 10%. Clearly, 9.9% is your best first quarter there in a while. Can we get a little -- just a little more detail on how you expect those to trend maybe throughout the year and then going forward, in terms of the new business coming in and how we could see margins trend in '13 and then sort of going forward from there?
Barbara A. Niland: So I'll start, and then I'll let Mike weigh in on my comments. First of all, I'd say 9.9% isn't really sustainable. We had some ships -- some submarines come out of warranty, we had favorable rate performance, we have a couple of different things going on in VCS program that allowed us to make the favorable adjustment this quarter. And all along, we usually have -- if you look last quarter and you look first quarter 2012, we had favorable adjustments on VCS, and it's really just as we hit certain milestones in the program, we retire risk. So we won't see it every single quarter, but you'll see it on and off, which drives that high rate. Overall, we're at the mix that Mike talks about, new contracts as well as more mature contracts and the process at Newport News, which allows us to have that blended rate of 9%.
C. Michael Petters: Right. Well, over time, you'll see that the Ford is a cost-type contract. We expect that we'll move to a -- some kind of fixed-price incentive contract on the Kennedy, which means we'll start that work. And as that work starts to ramp up, the -- we'll have our eyes on all of that risk so the booking rates will be fairly low. And then as they mature, we'll -- they'll become part of the blended rate. But that's our expectation. And so that's why I always think that the best place for this business to be and the best way to think about a shipbuilding business is that it's in the range of a 9% to 10% business because you need to have a blend of fully mature programs plus new programs so that you can't sustain that over a period of time. That's certainly what our objective is, and that drives our overall Navy strategy.
Jonathan Raviv: Okay. And a quick follow-up on Avondale. It sounds like you're being a little more active in terms of pursuing projects, but also actively keeping the shipyard alive. How was that impacting your discussions with the government in terms of what you expect to be able to recover or the timing of that recovery or if it's going to happen at all?
C. Michael Petters: Well, our discussions with both the Navy and the State of Louisiana continue to be very positive. The Navy is very supportive of our effort to redeploy, as opposed to close the facility. And obviously, the State of Louisiana is working very, very closely with us to find the right opportunity that makes sense for -- first of all, makes sense for Avondale. But that would also make sense for them. And so we maintain a very, very, I'd say, high-bandwidth of communication with both parties to make sure that everybody understands what we're doing, and we're very comfortable with the way that this is playing forward so far. Whether you want to talk about the incentives that the state has put on the plate -- on the table or the restructuring that we have in front of the Navy, we're very comfortable with the way this is working right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: One point of clarification. The way I read in your release, favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes, that strikes me as more onetime than the general risk retirement that you wind up seeing quarter-to-quarter. Am I correct in that, or...
Barbara A. Niland: You are correct. When we're -- when we file the -- adjudicate all the changes and everything, you get the fee on top of the cost and your change in your targets, and so you can recognize all that at the point you finalize. So that's onetime.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then just to -- a follow-up question. If I back out what seems to be maybe 20% or so of 0 margin programs this quarter, the margin at Ingalls is a little bit over 5%. Now Mike, historically, I mean, would you expect to get a -- like a 400-basis-point increase in 2 years for retiring some risk on some of these newer programs?
C. Michael Petters: Well, remember where we are is that the new programs have to mature. They've got to come through their -- the keel events, the start of fabrication, the first few phases of construction. But yes, I could see that.
George Shapiro: I mean, is that historically kind of a normal kind of sequence that you would expect to see, or is there more...
C. Michael Petters: I think it's -- to be frank, George, it's a little bit hard to talk about the history here. I mean, the operating system that we're using at Ingalls is fundamentally not something that we've used at Ingalls, and we started this just a few years ago. So we don't really have the track record of what that provides to us. On the other hand, the -- it does look a lot like the system that was in place back 15 years ago. And in -- 15 years ago, if you took an individual ship program and you looked at how it matures over its life, a ship that takes 4 to 6 years to build, and you're going to talk about what do you do with the booking rates when you go from year 2 or 3 to year 5 or 6, yes, 400 basis points is certainly within the range of reason.
Operator: Your next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Barb, could you maybe start on free cash flow? I think you mentioned it will be positive, but I guess I'm looking to flesh that out a bit. Because when I think about your S-curve chart for working capital, I think about the pension. Year-on-year is a bit of a headwind but after tax, not much, and net income, cash earnings rising. What am I missing that free cash flow in '13 isn't as good or better than '12?
Barbara A. Niland: So what happens with, say, the delivery of LPD-25, you have to think of deliveries have -- when you think about S-curve, the reason why you're on the upside is because you're delivering the underperforming ship. So you no longer have -- you collect the retentions with the exception of a little bit related to the warranty period and everything that they hold back, but that's usually a big number, $50 million, $60 million. And also, you can bill 100% of your cost so you're not dealing with this lower cost or progress when you get to delivery. So you got a pickup there also. So you have a big cash bump with deliveries, and that creates that reversal on that S-curve.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes. So -- but you are planning some deliveries for this year, so...
Barbara A. Niland: We are planning the LPD-25 delivery, and we haven't given up on LHA-6 getting out of here. We just know that there's pressure and we're going to do it in a very thoughtful, methodical way to do it the most efficient and cost-effective way to make that delivery. So there could be some pressure on that, that's why I said, "Hey, the lumpiness at year end on the cash balance is related to the timing of collections, as well as timing of deliveries."
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. All right. Mike, the other question I have for you is on supply chain. You mentioned it in kind of your opening remarks with respect to sequester and your conversations with the Navy customer about that being probably more of the concern to the health. I'm curious from a financial perspective, how protected you are within your contract structures against the suppliers, the weakness under sequestration? Is this more of a customer heads-up that this could cause an issue to you? Or is this also a self-protection against your own contracts?
C. Michael Petters: Well, gosh, with 5,000 suppliers in all 50 states, I'd say the answer to your question is just probably all over the map. There are some suppliers that are probably in a place where they are -- they have their substitutes if there was problems from their standpoint. I think that they're looking at the same kind of thing that we've been looking at. It just -- we look at it in a -- at a very broad level. They have a very narrow perspective. They have to decide whether they want to invest in the workforce or the tooling to support a program that they don't know exactly when that program is coming. However they make that decision, it's possible that, that could lead to some inefficiency in the supply chain, could cause some people to decide not to make the investment and not to stay as part of the team, depending on whether programs get delayed are not. We take each case in our supply chain, both at Newport News and at Ingalls, we handle each one of these as an individual case. We evaluate how critical the technology is, how critical the supplier is, what's the risk to the program, what -- how important are they to the schedule, and we factor that all into the way that we put a purchase order in place with them. We go so far as, in some places, we put our own people in their plants to make sure that we are helping them retire risk to support our schedules. And so we believe that we do this really well. It's one of the core competencies that we have. But because we do it well, we have a lot of contact with these guys, and we know that if there's a lot of restlessness out there in the supply chains today because they can't really figure out exactly when the next level of procurement is going to come, and when's the next ship going to happen. And that uncertainty is really creating some chaff in the supply chain, if you will, in a supply chain that over the last -- in my opinion, over the last 10 years has already been thinned out because we've done so many lead ships. We're -- I believe in the submarine program, we're 80% sole-source. We will probably be, I bet, at least 60% sole-source on the Kennedy. And so you start to see that they're just -- it's -- this is becoming a very important part of our business to manage. So I think it's -- there is not one-size-fits-all answer here, Myles, but it's kind of all over the map. But we do feel good that we -- this is something we do know how to go manage.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes, I mean -- and I don't want to diminish it, but it seems like your business would have some of the best visibility and certainly -- your programs having the best visibility, and if you get the 51 in VCS multiyear this year and maybe the CVN-79 this year or next year, I mean, it's hard for me to see what the supplier -- I could see if their business were touching other elements of the defense complex, but within your subsegments, visibility the is probably better than it's ever been.
C. Michael Petters: Yes, I agree with that. I think that even though that we're 80% sole-source in submarines, we have been able -- because that has been a very -- has become a very predictable business, we've been able to manage that supply chain in a very efficient way because we have sustained demand there and the suppliers know that. They can invest against it and be very efficient to it. I think this is more of a problem for the non-nuclear side of the business, where the -- it's a bit more dynamic. When is the next amphib coming? What's the story? Is there going to be a follow-on to LPD-27? The National Security Cutter, we basically have proposed that if we really want to save some money, we should do multi years on National Security Cutter. We've not had any commitment to that from the Congress, and so those are one ship at a time. And so if you're a supplier in those programs, you're living a little bit closer to the edge than you might be if you're a, say, in a submarine program or the destroyer program, where you can kind of see the horizon a little bit better.
Operator: We have a question from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Mike, how do you manage the fact that you had mentioned you're going to move some work from Pascagoula back to Avondale on the LPD-26 and 27? I mean, how do you manage that efficiently? And then on the LHA-6, you've kind of raised the question here about potential delay and delivery and stuff. At what point would we -- would you be confident about that? And at that point, would that necessarily mean another charge or not?
C. Michael Petters: Well, let's take the 6 first. I don't see this as being a charge to get the ship to delivery. I think this is really a matter of sequence. And the task for the team is, as we sit here and we're walking through the sequence to get to completion and then delivery, we feel very confident that the ship will be completed this year. The question is, can you get beyond the acceptance trials and get the closeout done in time before December runs out? And I think that's really all we're up against. And the one thing that we're going to make sure that we do is we do this as efficiently as possible. If it delivers in December, that'll be great. If the efficient way to do this is to deliver it in January, that'll be great, too. And so that's kind of the way we're looking at it right now. We're pretty transparent about all of this. The team is doing some pretty incredible things to get that ship ready to go to sea, and I'm very proud of what's going on there. It's just that the calendar and the schedule are intersecting a little bit at the end of the year, that's all. Relative to the movement of units or the construction of units at Avondale, this is a pretty fluid process relative to -- we can build units at Avondale and transport them pretty efficiently. We've done that in the past. Frankly, we actually had folks that we outsourced these units to in the past, so we've kind of brought them in to do ourselves. And we can look at this in terms of what are the skilled trades that we're going to potentially need for a redeployed Avondale and align that. The haul guys and the piping guys are folks that we really are going to need if we're successful in redeploying Avondale and that lines up with this work. And so this is a very low-risk way to buy some time on the clock, and that's kind of the approach that we're taking. But don't get me wrong, I mean, it's not going to buy us 2 years. It's going to buy us months.
Operator: I'd now like to call -- hand the call over to you, Mike Petters, for closing remarks.
C. Michael Petters: Okay. Well, thanks to everybody for joining us this morning. Again, we had a good, solid first quarter. We're right on track to retiring the risk that we said we needed to retire by the end of this year. We feel really good about that. And we continue to be on track to obtain our objectives for 2015. We are very, very engaged in the process in Washington relative to the strategic issues around shipbuilding schedules, and the best way to buy these ships and how does that match with other priorities. And so if you stick your head up and look around, you'll see advertisements from us, you'll see program stuff, and most of that is really going to be about how do we transition the amphib production lines that are warm to the future amphib lines that we need. So with that, thank you all for joining us, and we'll be talking to you.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, and enjoy the rest of your day.

Mike?
C. Michael Petters: Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I am pleased to report Huntington Ingalls Industries results for the fourth quarter of 2012. Today, we reported sales of $1.8 billion for the quarter and full year sales of $6.7 billion, both up slightly from last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.98 for the quarter and $2.91 for the full year. Pension-adjusted EPS was $1.30 for the quarter compared to $1.25 last year and for the year, $3.95 compared to $4.15 in 2011. All 2011 comparative earnings and margin results exclude a noncash goodwill impairment adjustment of $10 million in the fourth quarter and a $290 million charge for the full year. The segment operating performance was very strong. Fourth quarter adjusted segment operating margin was 7.7%, up 94 basis points from last year, and for the year, 6.8%, up 55 basis points from last year. The margin expansion was primarily driven by improved operating performance at Ingalls. Including $236 million of increased pension contributions in 2012, free cash flow for the year was $170 million compared to $331 million in 2011, and we ended the year with over $1 billion of cash on hand. We received $6 billion of new awards during 2012, including the detail design and construction of LHA 7 Tripoli and LPD-27, contributing to a healthy backlog that was $15.5 billion at the end of the year. The cash generation that has been realized over the past 2 years, along with the confidence that we have in the long-term performance of our programs, affirm our decision to proceed with a balanced cash deployment strategy that will return cash to shareholders, optimize our capital structure and prudently pursue value-creating growth opportunities. One of these growth opportunities involves the potential redeployment of our Avondale facilities and more importantly, our talented Avondale workforce into the commercial energy market. We are pursuing this opportunity, which would open up a new source of revenue with long-term growth potential, diversify our customer base and enable us to retain the Avondale workforce and facilities. Our announcement earlier this month that we are opening a business development office in Houston, Texas, was the next step to help us evaluate and pursue engineering and construction opportunities in this market. The Avondale facility sits on over 260 acres on the Mississippi River, has world-class modular construction capabilities, features the largest floating drydock in North America and requires little or no additional investment to pursue this market. As for returning cash to shareholders, our share repurchase program continues and we were pleased to announce our second quarterly cash dividend earlier this month. Now to hit a few highlights of our major programs, and please keep in mind that this assumes a reasonable resolution to the fiscal year 2013 budget. Let me begin with Ingalls. LPD-24 Arlington was delivered during the fourth quarter, which leaves only 2 remaining underperforming ships at Ingalls, LPD-25 and LHA 6. The delivery of LPD-24 and the continued progress on LPD-25 and LHA 6 represent key milestones on our path to achieving our 2015 operating margin goal. LPD-25 Somerset, the last Navy ship under construction at the Avondale shipyard, successfully completed combat systems light off and remains on schedule to deliver later this year. And at Pascagoula, we continue to ramp up our construction and make progress on LPD-26 John P. Murtha and LPD-27, the newest ship in the San Antonio Class of LPDs. LHA 6 America remains on schedule for delivery later this year, and we are making progress on LHA 7 Tripoli. In the National Security Cutter program, NSC-4 and NSC-5 are under construction and we are under a long lead time material contract for NSC-6. We expect awards for the construction of NSC-6 and procurement of long-lead-time material for NSC-7 in 2013. Construction of DDGs-113 and 114 in support of the DDG-51 program restart is progressing well. We expect the Navy to announce the next DDG-51 multiyear ship award of either 9 or 10 ships split between ourselves and our competitor in 2013. On the DDG-1000 destroyer program, we delivered the composite deckhouse on DDG-1000 in the fourth quarter. Construction of the Aft PVLS modules, hangar and deckhouse for DDG-1001 is progressing, and we are under contract for procurement of long-lead-time material for similar work on the third ship in the class, DDG-1002. At Avondale, we continue to wind down Navy shipbuilding at the facility, which we expect to complete by the end of the year. And although closure remains our baseline assumption, we are aggressively evaluating the possibility of keeping the facility open, as I discussed earlier. And now turning to Newport News. CVN-78 Ford was 90% structurally erected and 53% complete at the end of the fourth quarter and is on pace to launch this year. We continue efforts under our construction preparation contract to ramp up design, planning, long-lead-time material procurement and advance construction on CVN-79 Kennedy, the next carrier in the Ford class, and anticipate having a construction contract in place later this year. In submarines, SSN-783 Minnesota remains on track to deliver this spring, 11 months ahead of schedule, and we have completed our module work on the first boat of the third Block, SSN-784 North Dakota, with shipment of the bowel section to Electric Boat in the fourth quarter. We expect a Block 4 contract award this year for 9 or 10 additional submarines with construction beginning in 2014. CVN-71 Roosevelt remains on track to complete its Refueling and Complex Overhaul and redeliver midyear. And while the Navy has announced the delay of the RCOH for CVN-72 Lincoln, our team continues efforts on the ship at Naval Station Norfolk, and we'll work to make as much progress as possible, as efficiently as possible, prior to Lincoln's arrival. CVN-65 Enterprise is expected to enter the yard later this year for inactivation and the defueling of its 8 nuclear reactors. In summary, we are very pleased with where we are on all of our major programs, and we remain confident in our ability to reach our anticipated 2015 targets. Newport News continues to generate steady and predictable operating margins, and while we know that risk remains on the last 2 underperforming ships, I am pleased with the progress we have made, and we expect delivery of LPD-25 and LHA 6 later in the year to drive operating margin expansion at Ingalls. Now regarding the uncertainty surrounding the defense budget and sequestration, the prospect of a continuing resolution without shipbuilding provisions is our primary concern. I've said in the past that shipbuilding was more insulated from sequestration due to the long-term nature of our contracts in our backlog, but we are not insulated from the impact of a continuing resolution. The failure to pass a defense appropriations bill for 2013 has delayed the start of the Refueling and Complex Overhaul of the USS Abraham Lincoln and could impact our DoD customer's ability to execute on new work. This will result in inefficiencies in the programs, increased cost, reduced learning curves, increased risk to an already fragile industrial base, and as the Navy has communicated, the fleet's operational readiness. Delaying the start of any shipbuilding or overhaul program invariably makes it more expensive because the work is precisely coordinated across numerous departments and with suppliers. All of that has to come together in a very synchronized way. And when you start moving things around, you upset that synchronization. We have been very clear and consistent in our efforts to communicate the adverse impact of the current continuing resolution and the threat of an extended continuing resolution without shipbuilding provisions will have. We remain hopeful that the right decisions will be made, and we continue to engage with our elected officials to ensure that they understand the implications of their potential decisions and ultimately, the unnecessary additional cost to taxpayers. Now since it's been almost 2 years ago, I have emphasized the issues we face and why it is critical that we retire risk and replace underperforming contracts with new business that can perform at more typical shipbuilding margins. Although we still have 2 years before we reach our 2015 targets, I am extremely proud of what our team has accomplished thus far, and I am confident that we will achieve our goals. I may sound like a broken record, but the story remains unchanged. We're steadily retiring risk, we're working with our customer to get critical new business funded and under contract at both shipyards, we're streamlining our operations, we're executing well on new business, we've created and are reinforcing a culture based on safety, quality, cost and schedule, which drives affordability, and we have a management team that is highly focused on maximizing shareholder value. Looking ahead, 2013 is the inflection point in our margin expansion story and we expect modest segment operating margin improvement with relatively flat sales. This will be driven by anticipated margin expansion at Ingalls, combined with the stability and predictability at Newport News. I look forward to reporting continued progress as we deliver on the commitments we made to our shareholders when we spun off in 2011. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barbara A. Niland: Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'd like to briefly review our consolidated and segment results as disclosed in the press release, then wrap up with some comments on pension. Before I get into the details, all non-GAAP comparisons to 2011 excludes the noncash goodwill adjustment in Q4 and the total goodwill impairment charge for 2011. We are also providing you pension-adjusted operational results including operating margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share to show operational performance without the impact of the FAS/CAS Adjustments. Now if you turn to Slide 4 of the presentation. Fourth quarter sales increased by 5% over the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales in aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships. Our fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $106 million, pension-adjusted operating income was $131 million, up 11% over 2011. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.98. Pension-adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.30, up 4% over 2011, driven by improved operating performance at Ingalls. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share would be approximately $0.23 higher if you exclude the impact of the increased noncash workers' compensation expense related to the lower discount rate, which was $10 million for the quarter, and the increase of $8 million in deferred state taxes in the quarter, which resulted from settlement of prior year deferred state taxes. Turning to Slide 5. Sales for the year increased 2% over the prior year as a result of higher volume on aircraft carrier and surface combatant programs, partially offset by reduced volume on submarine and amphibious assault ships. GAAP operating income for the year was $358 million. Pension-adjusted operating income was $438 million, up 6.1% over 2011. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.91 for the full year. Pension-adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.95, down from $4.15 in 2011. 2012 pension-adjusted diluted earnings per share would be approximately $0.70 higher if you exclude the increased noncash worker's compensation expense related to the lower discount rate, which was $34 million for the year, the $8 million noncash Tax Matters Agreement expense, both of which we discussed on the third quarter call and the $8 million increase in deferred state taxes I referred to earlier for this year. Cash provided by operating activities for the year was $332 million, a decline of $196 million from 2011. This decrease was primarily driven by $236 million of increased contributions to our qualified pension plans in 2012. Capital expenditures were $162 million or 2.4% of revenue, $35 million less than last year. We began our share repurchase program in November and through the end of the year, we purchased approximately 31,000 shares at a cost of $1.2 million, and we ended the year with just over a $1 billion cash balance. Turning to Slide 6. Ingalls' revenue for the quarter were $722 million, up 6.8% from the same period in 2011, primarily driven by higher sales on LHA 7 Tripoli, partially offset by lower sales following the deliveries of LPD-23 Anchorage in the third quarter of 2012 and LPD-22 USS San Diego in the fourth quarter of 2011. Ingalls' operating income for the quarter was $38 million compared with $15 million in the same period in 2011, and operating margin was 5.3% for the quarter, up from 2.2% in the same period last year. Turning to Slide 7. Ingalls' revenue for the year were $2.8 billion, relatively flat from 2011, with lower sales volume in the amphibious assault program, partially offset by higher sales volume in the NSC program. Ingalls' operating income was $97 million compared to $70 million in 2011, primarily due to overall improved performance, partially offset by an increase in workers' compensation expense due to the lower discount rate. Turning to Slide 8. Newport News revenues for the quarter increased $44 million or 4.1% from last year, primarily driven by higher sales volume on Ford, the construction preparation on Kennedy and higher sales volume from the advanced planning on the Lincoln RCOH. For the year, Newport News revenues increased by $174 million or 4.6% from 2011, primarily driven by higher aircraft carrier volume and energy services revenue related to the maintenance of the Kesselring site. Newport News operating income for the quarter was $102 million, flat from the same period last year. For the year, Newport News operating income was $360 million compared to $342 million last year, primarily driven by volume and favorable cumulative adjustments on CVN-65 Enterprise, EDSRA and CVN-71 Roosevelt RCOH, partially offset by the increased workers' compensation expense due to the change in the discount rate. Newport News operating margin for the year was 9.1%, unchanged from 2011. If you'll turn to Slide 9, I'd like to make a few comments on our pension and postretirement benefit related assumptions. As always, remember that pension-related numbers are subject to change based on year end performance, discount rates and other measurement criteria. We are providing these estimates in ranges as we have many moving parts this year, including the collective bargaining agreement to be negotiated at Newport News this year, and we will be remeasuring pension expense along with cash contributions upon the completion of negotiations. So in 2013, we estimate the FAS/CAS Adjustment to be a net expense between $70 million and $100 million, and we expect qualified pension contributions to be between $270 million and $330 million, all of which is discretionary. Our pension assumptions are based on a discount rate of 4.24% and expected long-term asset return of 7.5%. Other postretirement benefit contributions for 2013 are expected to be $38 million. For 2013, we estimate that deferred state tax expense should be more in the $10 million range, net interest expense should be approximately $116 million and our effective tax rate should be slightly below 35%. As in the past, we will be a large cash user in the first quarter and see that trend reverse over the remainder of the year, and our capital expenditures for the year as a percent of revenue will be in the mid-2% to 3% range. That wraps up my remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dwayne for Q&A.
Dwayne B. Blake: Thanks, Barb. [Operator Instructions] Stephanie, I'll turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Two questions. The first, on Avondale, Mike, when you think about the decision process there, you said your baseline assumption was still closure but that you're exploring the opportunity that you laid out in the press release about a month ago. How should we think about how this process goes? You said there's little or no investment to pursue the opportunity you've outlined. But obviously, that business still has overhead, and I wondered where you stand in terms of building the, sort of, new book of business and what sort of time line you're giving yourself to do that to determine that this opportunity is really viable? How should we think about that thought process from your end?
C. Michael Petters: Well, I think, the first thing to recognize is that the most important asset that we have in Avondale is the workforce that's there. And we're phasing into a market that appears to have a large demand for a highly skilled and qualified workforce. The projects in Louisiana and Texas that have already been announced, and the ones that we know are on the books to be announced, demand a workforce that's larger than is in place in that region of the country today. And so we're being swept -- we're being pulled into that. People are calling for our skilled workforce to be applied to that base. I think there's 2 elements of that, that we have to think through, and we will be working our way through that mostly this year is, number one, how do we sustain the workforce to line up with the work opportunity? Make sure -- how do we bridge from the Navy work that we're doing? If we just go and finish the Navy work, the workforce at Avondale will continue to ramp down through the end of this year when there'd be no workforce left. And we have to kind of understand when would that workforce be required, and is that this year or is that early next year or how do you bridge through that? And that's still unfolding in front of us. And so we're working our way through that piece of it. I think the second part of it is to recognize that it really is about getting the Navy work out of the business so that we can restructure the cost and be affordable. We may have the most skilled workforce in the area, but if they're not competitive, we won't be able to go very far in that marketplace. And so both of those issues, how do we sustain the critical skills that we need, how do we demonstrate our affordability, those are the things that we're going to be working on. I mean, we're working on them now and we'll be working on them through, basically, the next couple of quarters here this year.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great, and one question on cash for Barb. I noticed that despite the pension contribution, which was pretty sizable, your conversion of net income was still very high at about 116%. As you look forward to next year, obviously, you've called out that the pension contributions will be a little bit higher, that'll be a bit of an incremental use. And I know that the deferred taxes were a bit of a source this year. You said that the cash will be used early on and then, step up over the course of the year, but as I put some of those pieces together, is it still likely that the cash conversion can be better than 100% of net income, again, next year? Or again in 2013?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay. So I'm going to sound like a broken record myself, but it all depends on the timing of the ship deliveries and the timing of the payments from the customer because we'll be having big invoices after this delivery. So I won't commit that it'll be 100% cash conversion, but I will commit over a very long period of time, you can look at it that way and it works out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm interested in understanding a little bit more about how you would see the CR and sequestration impact. And I know, Mike, you mentioned the Lincoln refueling delay. When you look at the CR, what are the things that you think could impact the company most in '13 and '14? And I'd ask the same about sequestration, knowing that some things are under contract and you probably won't see a lot of impact. But what are the ships that you're most concerned about?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. That's a great question, Doug, and we've spent a lot of time on this. I have said from the beginning that sequestration, by itself, is not nearly the issue for us that it is for a lot of other folks in our space. Sequestration, the way that it's laid out is typically going to -- it's going to be about today's cash expenditures. So the short of it is, the way you get at today's cash expenditures by the government is, you talk about flight hours and steaming hours and training dollars, which is not really in our -- we have some business in that area at Continental and at AMSEC, but it's not the principal source of our business. And from the beginning of this, we've been focused on the continuing resolution. If you want to think about where we are, it's the end of February, we are operating under a continuing resolution for 2013. Well, the fiscal year 2013 started in October, October 1. And frankly, Doug, we go through this every year. You need an appropriations bill to allow you -- new programs to start on October 1. Well, this year, October 1, 2012 is actually March 27, 2013, and we're about halfway through the process, and we still don't have a budget for 2013. So all of the things that were due to start in 2013 have not been allowed to start by the way that the continuing resolution was structured. So in one sense, we look at March 27 as just October 1, except the dynamics of and the interplay between sequestration, the delay of sequestration to March 1 and now the 2 of them are interacting, and amongst themselves creates some level of uncertainty that March 27 is actually going to have an appropriations bill. And our concern, and we've actually been saying this for some time now that our concern has been that if you just extend the CR the way that it is now, many of our programs will be affected. One program that's already been affected has been the destroyer program. The destroyer program was a bid that we put together last summer. My view is the Navy would've been able to evaluate those bids and make those awards before the end of last year, but because we had a CR, they have to push that off until the end of March or April, can't do a new start under the current law. If we get an extension to the CR, then that award gets moved all the way out, past October 1, 2014. Now let's go down the list of all of the starts that we have to have in 2013 that we were -- that we have been counting on and that we are working very hard for. We mentioned the Lincoln. The Lincoln was due to arrive here on February 14. A few days before that, we were notified that the Navy, because of their uncertainty around what would happen on March 27, decided to postpone that and have the work continue at the Naval Station but not come into the shipyard. That's not the most efficient way to do business, but it is the way the Navy's chosen to do it under the restrictions that they have to operate under. Now we have a workforce that's working on the ship there, but it is not -- they're not making nearly the progress that we would be making if we were here in the shipyard. Other work for 2013 that we would see if there had been a normal appropriations process, the start of the Kennedy, the detail design and construction contract for the Kennedy is due to be awarded before the end of this fiscal year. The inactivation of the Enterprise is due to begin during this fiscal year. I've mentioned the destroyer award, I've mentioned the Lincoln. There's cost to complete effort on LHA 6 and LPD-25 and on -- I'm sorry, LHA 6 and on CVN-71. Now we find ourselves in a place where our list of things that we have to have in FY '13 is an exact copy of what the Navy's list is for what they have to have in 2013. And if you look at the testimony that the Chief of Naval Operations and the Vice Chief have given over the last 6 weeks, their list and our list are the same. And so we expect that March 27 will ultimately look like October 1 should have, and that's the way we're thinking about our business. But it's a pretty dynamic time right now, and we're getting a lot of visitors to our business to understand what these impacts are.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: If you were to look at the sequester, now I know that's not -- you said it's not as big an impact. Where would you see that as being most important? I'm thinking, if we go into a scenario where there was some relief in terms of the ability to reprogram funds on a CR, yet we have sequestration at some level going forward, are there programs that you would think '13 and '14, that, that would have a significant effect on?
C. Michael Petters: Yes, Doug, I don't know how to put my arms around all of the potential variations that are here. The fundamental question is that we're halfway through 2013, we don't have a budget for 2013. We actually are trying to figure out the 2014 budget legislatively while we don't have a budget for 2013. The degree of uncertainty is as high right now as I've ever seen it. We've operated under continuing resolutions in the past. Typically, we've had continuing resolutions with anomalies that would allow us to go start programs on time. This hasn't happened this time and this one has -- this continuing resolution has been exceptionally long, and the prospect of an extension is what our concern is. How the numbers between what happens with the sequester and how that interplays with what the ultimate numbers that come out of a continuing resolution or appropriations bill, how those interact, there's probably as many variations as there are people with opinions. What I would say is that, overall, we believe that the fundamental issue of the fiscal challenges facing the country are strategic issues for us in the -- on the horizon in terms of the size of the Navy and the amount of support that we would be providing from a shipbuilding perspective. There may be things, like we've talked about many times, there may be things where a program might move from 1 year to another because of budget authority issues or outlay issues, that's -- we kind of typically deal with those kinds of things as they come up. But the strategic issue of how big is our Navy, what kind of ships are going to be in it, I think that's a 5- to 10-year time frame, and that's really the longer-term strategic impact of this.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Mike, you mentioned 2013, you're expecting similar revenue to 2012. But following on Doug's comments, it looks like the sequester is going to happen. Is there any way to handicap the top line guidance you've given, assuming that we do get a CR for the full year, or if we get a resolution by -- at the end of March? Is there any way to add some color around that?
C. Michael Petters: Yes. Again, I think there's just so many variables here relative to how this all plays out. If all you had was a sequester and then you had shipbuilding, all of the shipbuilding things happen the way that they happen, our continued discussion about a business that's got flat revenues pretty much holds in place at this point, as best we can understand it. The dynamics of what might happen in a particular harbors and how Continental might be affected or how AMSEC might be affected, those are very important businesses to us. But in terms of affecting the kind of numbers that you're talking about, we're not as -- we're much more focused on the shipbuilding starts that we have to get done.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Okay, okay. Understood. I guess, one last one for Barb. Barb, you talked to 2013 pension, but for a lot of companies, they're projecting by 2014 or so, pension should begin to turn positive for them. Is that something you've taken a look at, sort of, the out year pension perspective?
Barbara A. Niland: Yes. Don't worry, we look at it all the time. But I'm not going to go out on a limb there because it'll depend on what asset returns are and things like that. But in 2014, what you see is 25%, I believe, of the pension harmonization coming into play. So that's increase in your CAS recovery over your FAS expense, so it's starting to align more. But I don't want to go out on a limb and say, yes, it's going to be positive, because I've got to take a look at whatever the returns are and I don't have that crystal ball.
Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division: Understood. Yes. Just assuming your returns hit your mark, things get incrementally better, it sounds like?
Barbara A. Niland: They'll get -- they'll be better than where they are today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: It's actually Jon Raviv on for Jason today. Just jumping back to Avondale for a moment. You guys, just to be really clear about trying to find the right partner to deal with a new customer outside of the Navy. I was wondering if you could add a little more color and maybe add some comfort on that front, given the fact that this opportunity would be something new for you guys, how are you making sure that you're not overextending, so to speak?
C. Michael Petters: Sure. We said we needed 4 things, actually, to be successful here. We needed the Navy to support us, we needed the state to support us, we needed a sustainable marketplace and we needed a good partnership or a good partner that understood the marketplace. What we've got is the Navy is definitely supportive of us pursuing this, and the state has been more than forthcoming in trying to create an environment where we could be successful here. Our view of the marketplace is that this looks pretty sustainable, at least for a while, and the demand, the fact that there's a demand for this and it's a pull into the marketplace instead of a push by us into something is a much -- that's a much different perspective than we had a couple years ago when we were first starting to think about what happens with Avondale. As far as the partnerships, what we found is that the folks that are in that business today are looking for good, skilled workforce, and they have been working with us to help us understand what the cost requirements would be, what the quality requirements would be, the schedule performance would need to be, the safety requirements that we would have to be able to perform to. And so we're getting good support from other players in the industry who are looking to us as maybe potential suppliers to them or maybe, ultimately, partners with them as they support this industry. So we're not charging into this with our blindfold on and just suggesting that we can do this better than anybody else. We're actually getting a lot of good constructive engagement from the folks who need to really make this be successful. And so we're treading carefully down that path of "does this make sense?" And as I said, it's going to come down to, "are we going to be able to sustain the workforce and can we meet the competitive requirements that, that industry will require?"
Jonathan Raviv: Fair enough. And then, just a quick follow-up on sequester. I know you said you guys are relatively insulated. But you do, do some repair and some O&M-type work, and Navy guidance has basically frozen a lot of that. Are you not seeing impacts from that sort -- those sorts of activities that the Navy has rolled out through the year?
C. Michael Petters: Well, certainly. I mean, the Navy has made some major decisions about -- they're not deploying assets on their normal deployments. They have provisionally announced availabilities for the third and fourth quarter that would not be performed. All of those things, at this point, and let's go one step further, it's more of a CR impact but something as simple as the Lincoln. All of those things -- none of that work is being done the way that it ought to be done. So it's all becoming more inefficient. The challenge for us is that some of that, you just have to wait and see how this plays out because I think what really is going to happen here is that the sequester law will go into effect at the end of this week but then, I think that the resolution of all of this issue is going to become apparent with the resolution of the CR at the end of March. And then, there's a lot of pressure on the sequester itself. My view of it, my personal view, my view is that the law will go into effect and that the energy will be focused on creating an appropriations bill or some kind of continuing resolution that actually creates a stable base for this to go forward in the next month. And so trying to speculate on how that's all going to play out is -- we've just chosen not to try to create any particular cases because we know that whatever cases we create will be wrong.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Staying on the same topic, I'd like to try to put a finer point on, at least, the dollars associated with the programs that we've been discussing. And I think you've gone over them, but if I've got this right, you've got or were hoping for fiscal '13 money of around $600 million on Kennedy, about $1.5 billion on Lincoln and I think about $900 million in O&M money on Enterprise. Then, there's a couple hundred million in prior year shipbuilding recovery. I think you mentioned CVN-71, et cetera. So I add all that up, that's about $3 billion plus. How much of that, if -- how much of that is in your '13 expectations? So that we can at least have some context if we get a full-year CR, for example, and there is no special rider for those funds or under what other circumstances might come up here, sequester, et cetera, how much of that $3 billion was in your calculus for '13?
C. Michael Petters: Rob, I would tell you that I'd go back to what we said before, we're assuming that all of this will work out. We're looking at March 27 as being October 1. And so I haven't added the numbers up the way that you have, but our view is that after March 27, we would expect that we would proceed on the path that we had laid out, that these programs would start in accordance with the schedule that's out there. If we find ourselves a month from now in a different place than that, then we will have to have a different discussion. But that's the path that we're on. It's encouraging to me that the Navy has identified the same priorities that we have and I think that our position and frankly, the industry's position, is pretty well understood. I was once told that short-term decisions in this business are political and long-term ones are economic. We're, quite frankly, in the middle of a big political decision right now that's going to play out over the next 30 days.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And Mike, I think we all understand that there's no clear outlook here. But I also think the only to talk about it is to, at least, know what you were expecting. And when I think about that money, and I understand that a good part of that $3 billion is '14, '15 and so forth from your P&L perspective, but is there any way to frame what the 2013 portion of that would be and then, we can all wonder separately about whether or not it happens?
C. Michael Petters: I don't know how to put my arms around that, Rob. I mean, we're looking at a carrier contract that with the -- the Kennedy contract itself was a multibillion-dollar contract that we have been spending money on for a couple years in advance procurement. If the Navy were to decide or if we were to find ourselves in a place where we were not going to go to contract in 2013, the next question is, "Okay, how do you bridge the work that you're doing to the contract whenever it gets awarded?" We've done that in the past. In fact, that's how we did CVN-78. That contract was supposed to be done in 2006. We actually didn't go to contract until 2008. We had 2 years of construction preparation there to bridge from the time when the contract was planned for, to the time that we actually went to contract. That allowed the design to mature more, it allowed all of those things to happen. But the sequence of how all that plays out is something that is very difficult for us to predict. What I do know is that none of these programs, none of these programs are being talked about in terms of cancellation. So that all of this is going to happen, it's really a matter of when and how is it going to happen, and that's what we're trying to work our way through. Our plan today is that it will happen on time because that's the most efficient way for this work to proceed in our business and it is absolutely the best way to be good stewards of the taxpayer dollars.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes, and I wasn't trying to ask you how it would play out. I was merely trying to understand how those four programs fit, what they're worth in '13. But I guess, it's sounds like that's just a complex answer. So I'll ask something else instead. On Ingalls, where you've clearly been progressing on your margin plan, at what point do you get enough of those 0 margin ships out the door -- and most of them are gone at this point, that you can give us some visibility into a consistent linear or sequential progression in margins? Do we get to a point we start to see 50 basis points a quarter or something like that?
C. Michael Petters: Well, our story 2 years ago is the same as it is today. We have 2 ships left to go that we expect to deliver this year. This year is a point of inflection for the business and that you will see earnings accelerate. I don't know that we will ever tell you that it's going to be a quarter-over-quarter slope on earnings for any part of our business. To quote my Chief Financial Officer, "This business depends and is lumpy." And so we're headed to 9% from where we are today. This year, we'll probably look more -- a little bit more like last year than it will look like next year. But that's because we're getting those last 2 ships out. We need '14 and '15 to make a progress on the new work that we've signed at Ingalls to get them to the point where they're mature enough to book at the normal rate, and that's what we're focused on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Mike, maybe I want to try to come at this from a slightly different angle, which is, people instead of dollars. And really, it seems that, obviously, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of different moving parts. But where you're starting to get impacted now on a material programs, it really seems to be the Lincoln, but it's only really just started, or a couple weeks in. And so could you help us understand maybe -- I know you have 37,000 employees in total in the company. How many employees -- what was supposed to be or what is supposed to be the ramp-up rate on labor on that very labor-intensive program as we go through 2013?
C. Michael Petters: Well, the normal course of business and the synchronization that we talk about in this business is that as you finish the Roosevelt, that workforce would transition to the Lincoln. And you know, the Roosevelt is in its last few months and will be heading towards its redelivery, and the people would normally just come off of Roosevelt because you ramped down towards delivery and they would move onto the Lincoln and ramp back up there. Instead of ramping up in the -- inside the shipyard, we're starting to ramp up over at the Naval base. I would say that what's happening to us right now is less about the people that are in the yard and it's more about our hiring rates and what our expectations are for the whole business. The reality is, and I had a chance to tell the President this yesterday, that over the next 5 years, we plan to invest nearly $1 billion in our corporate -- in our Navy business across the whole corporation. We will hire more than 10,000 people, and we will be investing $0.5 billion in the training of those folks. And we are throttling that right now based on "let's get some certainty about what these future programs and the timing of these programs will be." And I'd say, that's probably where the first effect is, is what are we doing with our hiring rates right now? Now let's go hypothesize. We have said that if the Lincoln doesn't come at the end of March or the beginning of April, we will be in a position there where we will have to start talking about layoffs, particularly because of that program. And how many and who and all of that sort of stuff remains to be determined based on how the rest of the business plays out at that point. But yes, we would be affected at that point, and we have a couple of thousand folks working that program today.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then, my second question is on the Virginia-class multiyear, could you just give us your latest -- and I may have missed it in your opening comments, but your latest on if this plays out the way you're hoping, which is during the month of March before the 27th, we get either an appropriations bill or a CR with the anomalies that have been discussed which -- I don't think you use that term, but that's, I think, what I was reading into your comments. If you get that, what your expectation would be, do you still think you can get that multiyear signed by the end of 2013?
C. Michael Petters: We do. The Navy has actually made a pretty good case. You set aside the -- I know it's hard to do for everybody, but if you just set aside the extraordinary budget process that's going on around sequester and the CR and everything, and you can actually find a way to look at the regular budget process that's going on where the budget gets submitted, the Navy defends its budget and the Congress weighs in on priorities, that process has gotten us to a place where the Congress is interested in a 10th submarine in that -- that's a 9-ship Block and they're interested in a 10th submarine, and they're interested in a 10th destroyer in the 9-ship program that we have already bid on. Both of those, to me, are indications of how important the Navy is going forward strategically. And I believe, I don't know whether those 2 platforms actually survived the extraordinary budget process, but I think that -- I believe we'll get to a contract on Block 4 by the end of the year. I do. I'm pretty comfortable with that, assuming that we get through the next month politically.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Mike, let me try and ask you a question that you can answer. How about, something about the fourth quarter. If I look at the carrier -- you mentioned -- you've called out the carrier volume as being higher than expected. Can you -- and I think relative to everybody's sales estimates, it did turn out to be higher. Is that more cost plus work that flowed through in terms of hours, is it long-lead material, is it just you're working ahead of schedule? What's driving, I guess, that coming in ahead and related since you were up 2% in sales for 2012. When you say your long-term target has been relatively flattish, are we now talking about flattish off this higher level?
Barbara A. Niland: Okay. So I'll take one on the carrier increase in sales. It's just really, it's a cost type contract, and it's just labor and material coming in. There's -- can't really say we're ahead of schedule in any way, but we're progressing well on that program. So I don't -- there's nothing special going on there, it's just timing. So as far as your question related to sales being flat, we're sticking with that story given what our expectations are in terms of the programs to get funded this year. Timing will drive a potential impact this year, but overall, don't see any issues as long as those programs are funded with our long-term projection.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And Barb, can I ask you another question just in terms of the balance sheet, in terms of some of the moving pieces? The shareholder equity decline from the third quarter and that accumulated loss and I guess, is that all pension? And then, the deferred tax jump, is that all related to the pension contribution, just in terms of those moving...
Barbara A. Niland: Okay. So for your first question, the answer is yes. But for the tax, it's a combination of a lot of things on the tax. In the fourth quarter, most state taxes are done and you're doing it for the prior year and it's just an increase provision adjustment related to free spend returns. So it isn't all pension on the tax side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes. Barb, in the fourth quarter, the Ingalls' margin, I mean that's a better margin than we've seen for probably 5 years, was there anything onetime in there, like, was there reversal of some of the reserves you took in the third quarter, or is that kind of just what the margin was?
Barbara A. Niland: Just what the margin was.
George Shapiro: And so then, what happens in 2013 as to why that 5.3% wouldn't be a sustainable margin because, Mike, the implication is if '13 looks like '12, you kind of take the average margin at Ingalls for '12, which is obviously, lower than what you've reported in the fourth quarter.
Barbara A. Niland: Well, we didn't say it was or it wasn't. Mike did say it would look a little like this year, but it'll be leaning towards the 5%.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then, on the percentage of sales that were probably those 2 programs where you're talking 0 margin now, are we down to somewhere between 20% and 25% of the sales at Ingalls?
Barbara A. Niland: Less than 25%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Mike, before Congress appropriations come in, I think the CNO was talking about the overall shipbuilding plan and kind of where it is today and where it would be if everything that's on the table actually played out like it's on the table. And they talk about a baseline of 295 at this point, ships, by 2020. I think he said it'll be 30 ships lower if everything played out the way it is, 260, 265. Do you have a sense as to what comes out?
C. Michael Petters: No. But what I do know is -- what we've seen is that there's strong support for carriers, there's strong support for submarines and there's strong support for destroyers. There is also strong support for amphibs, but by the normal course of business, we were going to be entering a bit of a lull in the amphib production. LPD-27 could've been the last LPD and LHA 7, we've got under contract, and LHA 8 is out there on the horizon. The Navy has a great desire for amphibs. The Marines are looking for lift capability. But in my -- I've said this before, in my opinion, it is, despite all of that desire and demand, that seems to be where the resources start to thin, in my view. And that's one of our core businesses and that's a big thrust of our political engagement right now is around how do you sustain the amphib lines. We've got a really -- we've squared away the LPD program at Ingalls, and we've got a pretty warm production line down there right now. You've probably seen that we've come up with some creative ideas to use that hull for other missions for the Navy that would create some affordability relief, if you will, for the Navy. And so we're going to continue to push that. But that's kind of the way that I think about it, Myles, is that the Navy's priorities at the top of the list are the carriers and then, the submarines and then, destroyers and the amphibs. That's where our business sits, and we're seeing this resource discussion kind of focusing on the amphib piece, not really on the other parts.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then, the other question. We've talked about from a revenue perspective, the CR and sequestration delays. But it's hard for us to see your contract protection relative to margin profit absorption and kind of the dynamics that can occur. Would you advise us to just think about the revenue risk at this point as opposed to any type of adverse drop through?
C. Michael Petters: Frankly, I'd counter back to -- I hate to sound a little bit more like a broken record, but this is tough to handicap because the way that the sequester and the CR now are interplaying with each other and the fact that we are very much more exposed to the CR as opposed to the sequester makes that -- as we said before, the work that we have under contract is probably not going to be terribly affected by the sequester. And the work that we have under contract doesn't get really affected by the CR. So in that sense, we keep doing what we're doing for the near term, and it keeps moving things the way that they've been moving. It's the signing of new contracts going forward that is really the big issue for us, and that's really about what does this business look like in 2015, '16, and '17.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then, the last one. Mike, I understand that the opportunity on Avondale and I think it makes sense to explore in the near term, I mean, is it -- do you envision, over the medium term, that it still sits under the Huntington Ingalls umbrella? Or is this more of a -- taking it to a -- from a neonatal stage to adolescent stage?
C. Michael Petters: Well, we certainly don't believe that we can be competitive if the cost structure is a Navy cost structure. So we'll have to find other ways to deal with creating a competitive cost structure for that business. And so I think you have an interesting perspective of -- this is the very beginning of this process and we will be exploring all kinds of alternatives there relative to how do we make that business -- in order to be successful, how do we make it competitive.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And Barb, what's the funding for the pension look like beyond '13, funding requirements for the pension? I know you said it was discretionary in '13, but beyond that?
Barbara A. Niland: We haven't given anything beyond that.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Where did the funding end up for the year?
Barbara A. Niland: 236 -- I'm sorry, for the -- 2012, minimum required was $64 million and we did $172 million of discretionary, so $267 million.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Sorry, I meant the funded status of the plan at the end of the year. Was it 1.1?
Barbara A. Niland: We continue to maintain a 90% funded based on what now is called MAP-21, but on a PPA basis.
Operator: And the final question will come from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with CRT Capital.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: The last question, G&A. Let's ask a real simple one. G&A in 2013, is it going to be less than 2012 or more than 2012?
Barbara A. Niland: That's a tough one to call. Pension expense drove G&A up from 2011 to 2012, and it'll really depend on what my pension expense looks like. And so I gave you ranges. So it could be close, it could be a tiny bit higher.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then, as I look at it, Mike, it seems like maintenance services as you put in there, services are at a bigger risk than products. Is that the correct way to look at it? If we are going to take anything out, assuming a CR and sequestration, would I be taking it out of the products side or the services side?
Barbara A. Niland: I mean -- Mike talked about that AMSEC and CMSD are probably less insulated, so it would be out of the services side for that.
Operator: That concludes the...
C. Michael Petters: Well, thanks for your time today, folks. I think we've demonstrated that our crystal ball is no better than yours relative to the politics that are out there. And the next month is going to be a pretty dynamic time. It'll probably be a new story, if not every day, every hour between now and the end of March. And as you know, we are very, very heavily engaged in that process to the best of our ability. And the thing about our business is it shows well, there's no misunderstanding about how important our programs are. The alignment we have with the Navy relative to the importance of getting the '13 budget, the things that they are prioritizing are the things that we prioritize. And I think the President's visit to our shipyard in Newport News yesterday just demonstrates the priority that our business has and the alignment we have with our customer. We've got a political process we've got to work through over the next month, and we'll be doing that. But our core business is staying -- we're very pleased with where that is. The progress that we've made in the last 2 years, but really, over the last 5 years since Barb and I first went to Pascagoula. Our focus on safety and quality and cost and schedule continues to drive the performance of this business towards our goals in 2015. And where I sit today, I'm not backing off of that. I think that we'll fight our way through the politics, but the execution and the risk retirement and the creation of value in this business, we're very focused on and then, we keep moving ahead on that. So thanks for your engagement with us, and thanks for your time today, and we look forward to seeing you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 Huntington Ingalls Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stephanie and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andy Green, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.
Andy Green: Thanks Stephanie. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barb Niland, Corporate Vice President, Business Management, Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.

We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation, as well as our earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Petters: Thanks, Andy. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. We know that a great many of you listening in this morning on the East Coast have suffered and are still dealing with the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy, and we want to you know that our thoughts go out to each and all of you. I am pleased to report Huntington Ingalls Industries' results for the third quarter of 2012. Today we reported sales of $1.6 billion flat from the same period last year, and diluted earnings per share of $0.26, compared with a loss of $5.07 in the third quarter of 2011. After adjusting for non-cash, non-operating items in both periods, adjusted EPS were $0.74 compared with $1.05 last year. Third quarter adjusted segment operating margin was 7.1% or flat compared to last year, and we ended the quarter with $766 million of cash and total backlog of $16 billion, with $13 billion of that funded. Our results through the third quarter contain non-cash workers' compensation and tax expenses that were unrelated to the core operating performance at both Ingalls and Newport News. In addition to these expenses, Ingalls operating margin was also negatively impacted by $20 million in EAC adjustments related to the LPD program. This charge was largely driven by performance on LPD-24, which just completed its final sea trials and is expected to be delivered by the end of the year. Following the delivery of LPD-24 the remaining two underperforming ships at Ingalls LPD-25 and LHA-6 are scheduled for delivery in 2013. As I've stated on previous calls, delivery of these underperforming ships is critical to achieving our 2015 target of 9 plus percent operating margin, and we are making steady progress towards that goal. Reflecting our confidence in the performance of our programs, and the ability to achieve our 2015 goals, today we announced our first quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share and $150 million three year share buyback program. Our quarterly dividend will provide a stable and recurring component of total return for shareholders and we expect our share repurchase program to more than offset the dilution from employee equity compensation over the next three years. Distributing cash to shareholders is one element of our balanced capital allocation strategy that we believe will maximize shareholder value. In addition to distributing cash to shareholders, we are continuously evaluating all options across the cash deployment spectrum, which include looking at organic growth opportunities, such as investment and facilities and equipment that enables us to expand existing product lines or improve efficiency and affordability. Our substantial investments over the past several years in expanding capacity for Virginia class submarines and the build-out of facilities for the enterprise inactivation are typical of organic growth opportunities that are available in naval ship building. Exploring other growth opportunities, including partnerships, joint ventures, and acquisitions that can make sense for us, if they are in adjacent markets or otherwise leverage our unique strengths and provide a clear path for us to create value. Our highly successful joint venture with Fluor and Honeywell at the Savannah River nuclear site is a prime example. Managing our liabilities, including funding of our pension plans, which is a very important responsibility and an obligation that we have to our greatest asset are talented workforce and reduction of debt, which can enhance our credit profile and reduce our cost of borrowing. Now to hear a few highlights of our major programs, beginning with Ingalls. LPD-23 Anchorage constructed at our Avondale shipyard, and the second of the original five underperforming ships was delivered during the third quarter. LPD-24 Arlington nearing completion in Pascagoula has completed builders and acceptance trials and should be delivered to the Navy by the end of the year. LPD-25 Somerset the last Navy ship under construction at the Avondale shipyard remains on schedule to deliver in 2013. And at Pascagoula, we are ramping up construction on our LPD-26, John P. Murtha, and LPD-27 the newest ship in the San Antonio class of LPDs. On the LHA program, during the third quarter we christened LHA-6 America and it remains on schedule for delivery on 2013. In the National Security Cutter program, NSC-4 and NSC-5 are under construction. And we are under a long lead material contract for NSC-6. We expect an award for the construction of NSC-6 in 2013. We are in the early stages of construction of DDGs 113 and 114, in support of the DDG-51 program restart. We expect contracts to be awarded for another 9 or 10 ships in 2013, split between ourselves and our competitor. On the DDG-1000 destroyer program, we have delivered the deckhouse for DDG-1000, the first ship of the class. Construction of the aft PVLS modules, hangar, and deckhouse for DDG-1001 is underway. And we are working with the Navy toward a contract for similar work on the third ship in the class, DDG-1002. At Avondale, we continue to wind down Navy shipbuilding at the facility, which we expect to complete by the end of 2013. And although, closure is still our baseline assumption, we are also assessing the possibility of keeping the facility open, as a manufacturer of industrial products other than naval ships. Now turning to Newport News, CVN-78 Ford was 87% structurally erected and 46% complete at the end of the third quarter and is on pace to launch next year with delivery in 2015. We continue to ramp up construction on CVN-79 Kennedy, the next carrier in the Ford class, and anticipate having a construction contract in place sometime in 2013. In submarines, we just christened and launched SSN-783 Minnesota and expect delivery in the spring of next year, 11 months ahead of schedule. We expect a Block 4 contract award next year for 9 or 10 additional submarines with construction beginning in 2014. CVN-71 Roosevelt is scheduled to complete its refueling and complex overhaul and redeliver in mid-2013. And we expect CVN-72 Lincoln, to arrive at the shipyard in February to begun it's RCOH. CVN-65 Enterprise, is expected to enter the yard in 2013 for inactivation and the defueling of its eight nuclear reactors. In summary, despite some difficulties in getting LPD-24 prepared for delivery, we are very pleased with where we are on all of our major programs and we remain confident in our ability to reach our anticipated 2015 target. Newport News is now entering a period over the next 12 to 18 months where it will establish its business base for the next several years, including CVN-79 construction, the CVN-72 RCOH, Block 4 submarines and the enterprise inactivation. Ingalls has already been awarded several key contracts including LHA-7, NSC-5, few LPD's and two DDG-51's and is well on its way to delivering the remaining legacy underperforming ships that we expect will drive margin expansion back to the 9% range. Of course the defense budget and sequestration remain uncertainties, but the nature of naval shipbuilding probably insulates us from immediate impact. Now since the spend I've consistently emphasized the issues we face and why it is critical that we retire risk and replace underperforming contracts with new business that can perform at more typical shipbuilding margins. And although we still have several years before we reach our 2015 targets, I'm extremely proud of what our team has accomplished, and I'm highly confident that we will achieve our goals. We're steadily retiring risk. We're getting new critical business funded and under contract at both shipyards. We're streamlining our operations. We're executing well on new business. We've created and are reinforcing a culture based on safety, quality, cost, and schedule, which drives affordability and we have a management team that is highly focused on maximizing shareholder value. All of these things give us the confidence in our outlook to begin distributing cash to our shareholders long before we originally expected, which reflects strongly on the performance of our shipbuilders, and the entire Huntington Ingalls domain. Now looking ahead to the remainder of this year, we continue to expect second half earnings to look like the first half excluding the third quarter non-cash items I mentioned earlier. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb.
Barb Niland: Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'd like to briefly review our consolidated and segment results as disclosed in the press release. Then wrap up with some comments on pension. Before I get into our operational results, I'd like to discuss the two non-cash, non-operational items that affected our income statement this quarter. First, we took a non-cash workers' compensation charge of $24 million, which resulted in lower segment operating income at both Ingalls and Newport News. In the third quarter of every year we update our self-insured workers' compensation liabilities based on factors including actuarial data, recent claims history, and prevailing interest rates. The charge included in this quarter was primarily driven by the decline in the discount rate assumption using computing the workers' compensation liability from 3.05% to 1.59%. The other operational item was an $8 million tax expense related to our spin-off tax agreement with Northrop Grumman, which reflects the portion of the final Northrop Grumman 2011 tax return filing attributable to the HII for the free spin period. This tax expense increased our effective tax rate for the quarter to 65%. These adjustments are difficult to predict and may be subject to both positive and negative adjustments in the future. Now turning to the financials on Slide 4 of the presentation, third quarter sales were flat from the same period last year, and included higher sales in carrier surface combatants and the NSC program, offset by lower sales volumes on amphibious assault ships. GAAP reported segment operating income for the quarter was $89 million. Total operating income was $66 million, and diluted EPS was $0.26. Adjusted for the non-cash workers' compensation charge and tax expense, segment operating income was $113 million, total operating income was $90 million, total operating margin was 5.6%, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.74. We ended the quarter with $766 million cash balance. Cash provided by operating activities was $137 million, a decline of $95 million over the same period last year. During the quarter, we contributed $47 million to our qualified pension plans, and on October we contributed $6 million, which completed our expected contributions for 2012. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $35 million, down a million from the third quarter last year. For the full year, we continued to expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of the 2% to 3% of sales range. As we said in earlier in the year, we expect 2012 cash flow to be similar to 2011 with the exception of the pension funding swing of a little more than $200 million. As you know, cash flows are driven by timing of collections and shift deliveries, so a difference in just a few days can make a material difference in year-end reported cash balance. Turning to Slide 5, Ingalls revenues for the third quarter were $670 million, down 9.5% from the same period in 2011, primarily driven by lower sales in amphibious assault ships following the delivery of the LPD-22 and LPD-23. These declines were partially offset by increases in surface combatants and the construction of DDG-114 and the NSC program. Excluding the non-cash workers' compensation charge in 2012 and the non-cash goodwill impairment charge in 2011 Ingalls operating income for the quarter was $10 million compared with $19 million in the same period in 2011. Ingalls adjusted operating margin was 1.5% for the quarter, down from 2.6% last year. Included in Ingalls operating income for the quarter were $20 million of unfavorable adjustments related to the LPD 22 through 25 contract with the majority of it related to performance issues on LPD-24, which is expected to deliver in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 6, Newport News revenues for the quarter increased $68 million or 7.8% from last year, primarily driven by higher sales volume on Ford, the construction, preparation on Kennedy, higher sales volume from the advanced planning on the Lincoln RCOH, and a $15 million favorable resolution of an outstanding contract adjustment on Enterprise EDSRA from 2010. This contract adjustment also favorably impacts operating income for the same amount. Adjusted for the non-cash workers' compensation charge, Newport News operating income for the quarter was $103 million compared with $94 million last year, primarily due to volume including the Enterprise EDSRA resolution. Newport News adjusted operated margin was 10.9% for the quarter, up from 10.7% in 2011. If you will turn to Slide 7, I would like to make a few comments on pension. As always a remainder that pension related numbers are subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria. So we've changed the chart from last year, so that the FAS/CAS adjustment shown here includes other post retirement benefits expense, and is comparable to the FAS/CAS adjustment we reported in our financials. This chart shows the sensitivity of our 2013 estimated FAS/CAS adjustment to discount rate assumptions and actual asset returns for 2012. And it also assumes a 7.5% long-term return on assets going forward, which is slightly lower than last year's assumption of 8%. At the end of the quarter, our discount rates are running approximately 100 basis points below last year, and year-to-date actual returns were around 10.6%. With regard to 2013 pension funding, we continue to assess our options in light of the recent pension release Legislation Bill passed as far the Highway Bill. Although our 2013 required contributions are likely to be very low, our discretionary contributions could be higher than this year depending on interest rates, actuarial assumptions, and other funding strategies. Lastly for the full year 2012 we estimate deferred state tax expense should run about $11 million, interest expense should be roughly $118 million, and our tax rate should be close to 42%. The FAS/CAS adjustment is still expected to be $74 million. And that wraps up my remarks. And with that, I will turn over my call to Andy for Q&A.
Andy Green: Thanks Barb. Just a reminder to everyone, if you could limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Stephanie, I'll turn it over to you and let you manage the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Mike, when we think about your revenue flow at Ingalls with the delivery of the zero margin LPDs continuing and then the new wins you talked about on the surface, other surface ships. And within the context of the insulation that you mentioned when you're talking about the budget uncertainty how many quarters of revenue visibility, do you think you have at this time, at this $700 million type average? How long can you do that? How do we think about that?
Barb Niland: Rob well if I can answer a little bit of that and then I'll let Mike add to it, if that's okay. At Ingalls we're seeing was about $7.6 billion in backlog. So when you think about how long it takes to deliver those ships and everything you can do the math, you've a minimum of 10 quarters, but I think that we won't have all those ships delivered in 10 quarters.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Okay.
Mike Petters:
 :
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse:  Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the same topic Barb, what percentage of Ingalls revenue in the quarter was represented by the zero margin contracts?
Barb Niland: We don't usually provide that. We provide generalities by year but not by quarter.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Can you talk about it on an annual basis?
Barb Niland: Yeah we talked about it in the past. We said that 25% was what we were burning off, so over the entire year.
Mike Petters:  But remember Rob, I mean that reflex here is to say okay, if it's, whatever the percentage, 25% or whatever is not performing then you want to say okay the rest of them must be performing at the top of the, at the right rate. Well what we're doing here is we're retiring the ships that should be performing at the top rate and we're filling in with work that the blend is low and so it takes time for us to walk our way up back to 2015 where we will achieve the nine plus objective there.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Well fair enough, and we know that there is adjustments that are made in there. But when I think about the fact that you had an underlying run rate of $30 million as Barb said on roughly sort of $670 million in revenue, and as we go forward more and more of that revenue of that zero margin is going to go away, as long as its replaced by profitable ships. You understand where I'm going?
Mike Petters: Yeah absolutely that's very fair.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Dough Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: I wanted to -- could you give a picture of your longer-term capital spending plans. If you look at Newport News, it seems like you've gone through the transitions related to Virginia Class, CVN-78, decommissioning, and then Pascagoula seems to be pretty modern at this point and how are you thinking about CapEx longer-term?
Mike Petters: Doug, I think, first of all I think you're right. The major projects at Newport News and it was the Virginia Class program to get facilities for two submarines per year production capability as well as the inactivation business for the enterprise and then the follow-on aircraft carrier and activation business. We are on the back end of that. We're thinking about the next round of investments for the Navy relative to future programs out there, whether it's a higher replacement programs or something like that or may be even thinking more about how do we retire the risk on certain programs to make them more affordable so that we can strengthen their position budget debate that's going on. So we think about that as well. We think the same way at Ingalls. Ingalls future is probably a bit more dynamic than the Newport News. One, the ships, there's, the ships are smaller and come a little bit faster and so being able to invest to support or kick start the next program and help make that affordable to help the taxpayers find their way to support it, it's something that we're very interested in doing. And so we're always thinking about that. Having said that, inside of our navy shipbuilding business today, we are on the back end of a pretty substantial investment, and we are very proud of the facilities and capital that we have in place today.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein:  And then on Ingalls, after having lost the DDG-51 competition, the last one to GD. When you look ahead now, what's the timing of competition for future DDG-51's and are you, where you want to be at Ingalls in terms of your competitive position when you look at those awards?
Mike Petters: Well we have that next round of competition is actually underway right now. Both teams have submitted bids. It's for, nominally for nine ships. There is discussion that the navy might actually try to find a way to award 10 ships in this discussion. The answer to your question about are we, where we want to be. We will not be where we want to be unless we win. And so we've taken a lot. We've taken a lot of steps. We got a lot of good feedback from that last round of competition. We have been driving our competitive posture and we look for ways to continue to improve our competitive position. But at the end of the day, no matter how good we feel about it, if we don't win we need, we have more work to do. And so that's kind of the way we're approaching it.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo:  Why don't we find out and understand a little bit more about the adjustment on the LPD 22 to 25. And I guess a couple parts, is number one, the 22 has been delivered for a while. So why would that still be going on? And then just trying to think about how the typical ship would go out as I would think you would have some contract closeouts when the 23 was delivered. But until the 24 gets delivered, you wouldn't have that next milestone. So can you just talk a little bit about that aspect of it?
Barb Niland: Sure. Across all four of those contracts we had a change in our escalation that affected the targets on this contract downward. All right, so that's just a cycle life of how the contracts work with escalation. So we had small piece of it was that. The majority of it was actually performance on LPD-24 and getting that ship to sea.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: Okay. And then what the performance in terms of the 24, are there any lessons learned that help you with 25 that or there are changes that you have to make in terms of the production or anything that you can kind of ensure that you wouldn't see a repeat with 25?
Mike Petters: Well as we've said all along these four ships 22 through 25 are challenges for us. Two of them are being built, were built in Pascagoula, two of them were being built in Avondale. The challenge specifically with LPD-24 was that LPD-24 was the last ship in the line, while in the production line while our shipyard was going through the trials and tribulations of LHD-8, LPD-22, the DDG-1000 swap, the startup of the NSC program, the other things that were going on there in the aftermath of the storm. So the 24 had a variety of issues associated with reallocating resources to those other programs. On the other hand LPD-24 had the full benefit or had the most benefit of the operating system that we put in place. And so as we approach delivery, the lessons that we learn from LPD-22 and 23 to get the ships to delivery, we absolutely applied and benefitted from. But on the other hand we still had to work through some of these longstanding issues that were out there. And as I, the other thing I said from the beginning is that the number one issue for these ships is we've to deliver. It's unfortunate and concerns us greatly when we have to do something like we've done this quarter. But we're very excited that we got the ship out to acceptance trials. We got to cross that threshold. The ship performed very well on acceptance trials and we are very strongly committed to getting that ship delivered before the end of the year. And the number one issue for us is getting these five ships delivered. This will be the third one. LPD-25 and LHA-6 deliver next year. The delivery of LPD-24 just enhances our confidence in and our plan to get those two ships delivered next year. Certainly, things that we learned from LPD-24 are rolled forward into 25 and LHA-6, Sam.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.
Peter Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton: I guess there is obviously still some risk remaining on 25 and LHA-6. Could you guys talk about some of these other programs, the destroyer restart? I know there has been a talk of a lot of new technologies inserted there Ford with I think has the emails. And then, the next Virginia contract that we expect to have any changes in booking rates there? Can you talk about those three areas and just, how we should think about profit risk on those programs?
Mike Petters:  Well, I think the first thing is let's step back at how do we do this. The way that Barb and I have set this to be done in this organization over the last five years is, we're very conservative on the front-end of the program. We identify what we think the risks are and we don't take credit for retiring a risk until the risk is actually retired. So, on all of the new work that we've started in Pascagoula the two destroyers, the two LPDs and LHA-7 were being fairly conservative there at this point given that, when you sign the contract you have a risk register and as we retire those risks then we will adjust the rates accordingly. That has been the approach to reduce the Newport News for many, many years. And so -- and it shows itself in all of the performance, in all of the programs that we have at Newport News. As we, we've had quarters where we've had step ups at Newport News due to a delivery of a ship, which is the ultimate retirement of risk on that ship, and that creates a little bit of a lumpiness quarter-to-quarter that you see. But over the long-term, it's a very, very solid way to recognize the profitability of the program, it's always stepping forward its pace I guess, is the right way to say that. And so, relative to the specific programs that you mentioned, the destroyer program, this is a restart of the DDG-51 line. There was a five-year gap in that line and we were given the opportunity to be the first two ships in production. We're very pleased with the way that production has started because we're actually brining the operating systems that we put in place, in the discipline and the culture to bare on these ships at the very beginning of the program. And so, we are performing as we expect to perform on those programs. I would say the same for the LPD's and the LHA. They are, particularly the LHA-7 probably not quite as for along as the destroyers are. But in all of those programs the things that we have done to improve our operating system and improve our culture and enhance the caliber and quality of our leadership team are all paying off for us there. At Newport News, and with regard to technology insertions, I'm not sure exactly what you mean by technology going into the DDG-51 program. This was merely designed to be a restart of a material product line. There is always some technology being inserted in the warfare systems and in the sensors. But in terms of building the ships, those are, the earlier we know about those the more we can accommodate them but they're not big drivers in the process that we use to fabricate the ships. Over to Newport News in the carrier program we've talked a lot about the Ford over the past several quarters. The Ford continues to be on track. It continues to be the very best lead ship that I've ever seen. We do have some of the standard issues that go along with lead ships. You have new technology that doesn't develop as fast as you need to and so you've to figure out how you're going to work your way around that in the course of the contract. Our contract structure recognizes that risk and we have the appropriate sharing mechanism with our customer, so that both of us get the real value for the taxpayers there, and so that's proceeding apace. The submarine program is going very well. And in fact, the submarine program is another program where the Navy is considering would really like -- I won't speak for the Navy but I would like to see the contract go to 10 ships. There is an effort in the Congress today to try to expand that nine ship offer in Block 4 to make that a 10 ship Block. And so, we're excited about that and we're leaning forward to it, and I think that's just a testament to the caliber of the team and the quality to work that's being done.
Peter Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton: Okay. Very helpful I appreciate that. And last question on pension. I guess for Barb, Barb it looks like on a net basis year-over-year, it looks like may be you guys are taking may be only you called it $15 million incremental pension headwind for 2013, does it sound about right?
Barb Niland:  Yeah, you're looking at that pension chart that we showed.
Peter Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton: Correct, correct.
Barb Niland: Well go in there. It's about that, may be a little higher.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Please proceed.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS: So, just on Hurricane Isaac was there any impact in the quarter from that, your financial in the quarter or otherwise?
Barb Niland:  Yeah, in the quarter we lost about $23 million of sale volume and about a $1 million OM on that. So we looked at that is not material.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS: Okay. And then, it looks like you guys have been on the debt, you've been chipping a way at it, kind of $7 million to $8 million a quarter. Is that something that we should sort of expect now with the repurchase of the dividends, were you asked to stay on that same kind, but the pay down rate?
Mike Petters: Yeah, I think that's fair. We're -- we were comfortable with the pace that we're on right now relative to our disruption.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Mike and Barb, I wanted to pursue a little bit, at the end of the second quarter you said like a $6 million reserve on balance sheet for completing the LPD stuff. And now you got $4 million. But so what's happened in the quarter that necessitated the $20 million incremental charge and it sounds like this is one-time stuff, but there must have been something happened in the quarter?
Mike Petters: It was, a combination of all the things we've already talked about George. I mean there was no major single event. It was we're in the same quarter where we're trying to get LPD-23 delivered. We're trying to take LPD-24 from builders' trials to acceptance trials. And so there is a big press on that to get that done. There is things that happen day in and day out. But then there is things that we're doing to recover from things that were a couple of years back. So I can't say that there was any single event on that. And I think Barb talked about how there was, the overall effect on the whole. Remember these four ships were all part of the same major contract and so the overall effect of the whole contract was impacted as well.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: And then what gives you confidence that LPD-26 and 7, which are also being made at Pascagoula, will be that much better than the 24 at Pascagoula. I mean, you got a better learning curve, did you get better pricing on 26 and 27, if you could just explore that a little bit?
Mike Petters: Sure. Sure, thanks George. I think the first thing is that you remember we talked before these -- this four ship contract was it assumed a serial production line with a very steep learning curve in it. And it was signed post-Katrina and it assumed a pre-Katrina cost base line. And that's what we've been dealing with from the -- really from the day the contract was signed we've been Barb and I got there a couple of years later and we've been dealing with that ever since we got there. When we go to contract on LPD-26, we number one, are taking advantage of the operating system that we put in place, which includes class plan, build plans, serial production assumptions relative to how we're going to build things. We're going to do things the same way over and over again. It includes the full scale risk register that we've created. It includes the phase construction program with the hot washes and the phase start discussions that we do. All of those things are there and it reflects the cost base line that we have experienced post-Katrina. And so all of those things in tandem give us great confidence that these ships are not anywhere near to the same path that the four ships in previous contracts were on. Having said that, we still -- we manage it exactly the way we manage all of our other programs. We are conservative on the front-end. We only take credit for risk retirement when it's actually retired. And so we're ramping on those programs today. We go into the start of fabrication or the start of a major milestone and we don't take credit for that until we've actually accomplished it. And I think that that's a tribute to the leadership team there in Pascagoula, the way that they've started on these programs, and Irwin and his team are doing a fine job of getting these programs started the right way. And I think that will serve us very, very well over the next couple of years.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Okay. And then if I may just one, may be one for Barb, how come last year you didn't have any charge for workers' compensation, because I'm sure the discount rate would have also come down last year in this quarter?
Barb Niland: So, we've a risk free rate and it wasn't as significant as the drop when we look at it this year. And so basically that was the driver.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: Well just a quick question on the cash deployment. I was getting now a dividend and a share repurchase program. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about other potential uses of cash, and your outlook now going forward with regard to acquisitions?
Mike Petters: Sure. I mean overall our number one challenge in this business is to achieve the full potential of this business. And that is to look for opportunities to create value and cash deployment is the way that we consider that. We're not completely focused in on any single approach. I think what we've described here is a very balanced approach of how we're going to deploy the cash. But we've talked about investing in the business that we're in to enhance new businesses like the carrier inactivation or the Virginia Class program or retire risk on programs to make them more affordable and may be help make them come to provision. But we also highlighted that; we're interested in doing those things that are -- that were uniquely qualified to do for may be other customers who may have a need for that. I think the team that we have at Savannah River is very a good example of how we are there to do nuclear operations. We are best in class when it comes to doing that kind of work and there are customers out there that need us to do that. We certainly want to bring the shareholders along and I think that from my standpoint, today is an historic day, really in this company today is the day we initiated the dividend and so we're very excited about that and we want to bring everyone along. We think that's a way for communicating and enhancing the value of this business as well.
. :
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: And then speaking of Avondale what is the date of no return on making a decision on what to do with that yard?
Mike Petters: Well, what I'd like to say is that we've already made our decision. We are closing the yard to navy business. The point of no return is really a discussion about the workforce. The delivery of LPD-23 means that LPD-25 is the only work that's left there. And so over the next year we will be delivering LPD-25. And as we go through that in the normal course of a ship delivery, the level of the workforce, the number of the workers that are on that ship will decline, has been declining, and will continue to decline. We do see that in that area of the country there are significant projects being planned or announced that would require a skill set that's not unlike the skill set that we have in Avondale. And it's modular construction, it's high energy systems, it's high density systems that we know how to go do. The challenge for us is what's the schedule for those projects, would we still have a workforce if we decided to deploy in that direction. And the second challenge is can we be competitive. And what does it take for us to be competitive in that environment. The fact is that having a qualified workforce and a skilled workforce in today's economy and in today's environment is a great asset and we're really working hard to try to figure out a way to take advantage of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan: I just have one more question on LPD-24 and the implications for later ships. I don't want to put words in your mouth but is it fair to characterize this as you were already at zero margin and the biggest reason for the impact this quarter is -- its just because you were already running so tight. And if we look at 26 and 27 it's something similar had happened close to delivery for those ships you probably the way you're accruing thins now you would have had a risk contingency that could have handled that?
Mike Petters: Joe you got it exactly right. That's exactly right. I mean the issue here is that these programs have been under water really from for a quite a while now. And so whatever we do, as we said from the beginning whatever we do on these programs is going to be very visible. The fact that we would be not actually taking credit on LPD-26 or 27 until we retire the risk means that you shouldn't see this kind of thing as we approach delivery on the new contracts.
Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Okay, fair enough. And then just a couple of little niche. I was wondering if you could provide what the EAC's were a positive to negative in the quarter that will be in your Q. And any commentary on what we might expect in terms of near-term share repurchase. Should we think about this kind of ratably over three years and so it's just like your shipping always the debt, you'll be shipping the way your share base or any color you can get on that? Thanks.
Barb Niland: Okay. So let me start with what you're seeing when we filed a Q on the gross favorable adjustments are $46 million, and the gross unfavorable adjustments are $55 million. So that $55 million includes the workers' comp and then the LPD 22 thorough 25 and the $46 million includes that enterprise EDSRA $50 million that we talked about earlier. As far as the share repurchase program we're looking at it. I don't want to really say that we have a prefect schedule of exactly how we're going to do it. We'll watch and see what happens.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: May be to go back to a couple of questions. Mike you talked about industrial products other than ships and I guess two questions on that. Why would you ever want to get involved in something where you've the workforce but may be not that core competency for the end market? And would seem like that's something at least to other companies and position the outset as such. So that's kind of a top-level question. And what would be the decision timeline for something like that?
Mike Petters: Well number one, there is no way we would get involved in something that was not in our core competency. I mean the reason that we are looking at this is because we do actually think we have a core competency here for fabrication and design -- design and engineering and fabrication of complex systems. We do know how to do that. The question about the timeline. So let me just put everybody at ease here. We're not charging out to go do something that we don't know how to do. We will only do something that we know how to do; we'll do it in a measured way so that we can prove to ourselves that we can be successful with it. Relative to the timeline for it again, I think that the compete -- the competition on the timeline is, we're not sure the demand for these products is going to be soon enough to support the workforce that we've in place. And so that's the balance that we're looking at. And, in the meantime we will continue to execute our plan to close the shipyard.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Okay. I'm just reminded like, commercial ships presumably that's something obviously we're not talking about. But something that you've the capability to do or forced to do. But at different market and different customers, sometimes is what dictates, what's not in the core competencies and I'm just kind of reluctant to understand how your translate what you do to an end customer whose is significantly different than your DoD customer in the risk profile that goes with that also?
Mike Petters: You know Myles; I've got lots of scars on my back from those kinds of initiatives. And so believe me, I'm treading very softly here. On the other hand we said from the very beginning that if we're able to create a partnership along the way that can take advantage of our unique capabilities where they would have an understanding of the role in the marketplace. If we're able to demonstrate the ability to be competitive, then I would have to say that's an opportunity for us to achieve some potential that we otherwise wouldn't have achieved. And so I'm being open minded about this at this point. We're not charging off in a reckless fashion at all. We're being very thoughtful about this. The reality is that the projects that are being planned or have been announced will require a manufacturing workforce that does not exist today. That is a reality. And so the question, if you're sitting here with a manufacturing workforce, the question is how you engage in that? And can you engage in that? And we're way in that.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then you mentioned both the teams have submitted bids in the surface destroyers with an expected decision for next year. Can you comment on the gates from a procedural budget process and if those are limiting factors to your resolution sequestration? Are those limiting factors, the actual award of the ship in terms of what your money we're talking about?
Mike Petters:  Yeah, I think the continuing resolution that goes through March does create an issue relative to the award of the contract before that. And so, this would be something after the March CR expires assuming that there was a FY'13 bill. And Myles that there is probably a range of possibilities there where you can have a normal bill, you can have a continuing resolution with anomalies, you can have a continuing resolution with no anomalies and you can kind of figure out which of those make sense for new starts and which doesn't. But in the situation we're in right now, well we don't expect that award to be in the current situation, it would be after this is resolved to the next phase.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Got it. And then, one last thing upon Barb, I think I got it that the workers' comp is in the AC. So that's effectively profit from prior periods or expenses that should have flown through prior periods based on what you know today, is that an accurate representation?
Barb Niland: Well, it works just like pensions. So when you adjust the discount rate, here in this case the discount rate going down, it increase your liabilities, you got to flow this, you got to expense those through your contracts.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank:  But is it being expensive to P&L today based on accum basis because?
Barb Niland:  Yeah.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank:  But the intention wouldn't amongst you're already in the zero margin to this?
Barb Niland:  Right, right.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank:  So that -- that was driving you?
Barb Niland:  Right. It goes through your calculation, your percentage complete on your contracts.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank:  Okay. And so, the only reason you're calling out this as different than some of the escalators that may have come down is because it's a specific item to workmen's comp, is that right?
Barb Niland: Correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with CRT Capital. Please proceed.
Brian Ruttenbur - CRT Capital: Hi, thank you very much. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on return of cash to shareholders as a goal. Right now, it looks like you're paying less than a 1% dividend yield and that's below, if you would say broadly appears. And what the plan is, I just want to understand what the plan is for you guys down the road on the dividend?
Mike Petters: Sure Brian. And I think it's fair to say that we are -- we take small steps and we wanted to start here in a very modest way. And as we go forward, we would evaluate our next approach. Our sense here is that we thought it'll be better to start early than to wait. And let's get started with it and then see where it takes us. And again, no need to go jump into the deep end of the pool let's just start here at the beginning and start walking down the path. 
Brian Ruttenbur - CRT Capital: Okay. And then, for Barb, just a quick question on the tax rate long-term. I think you mentioned tax rate in the 40s, 42% this year, what do you expect longer-term, going 2014, '15 when you're talking about your 9% operating margins I think in '15? What kind of tax rate are you looking at then?
Barb Niland:  Well, you're going out a long way. But I'd say hey, it really depends on what happens with like the domestic manufacturing deduction and your R&D credits and all the other sausage making that goes into the taxes. But if you want to pick a number, I'd just go with the statutory rate of 35%.
Mike Petters:  Brain, I would ask you what sort of tax rate are you looking at in 2015?
Brian Ruttenbur - CRT Capital: All right. It's going to be a heck a lot higher than all I know.
Mike Petters:  Different then what it is now?
Barb Niland:  I don't want to say that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ron Epstein - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Just a bigger picture question, in the prepared remarks you adjusted a little bit. But if we do run into some sort of sequestration scenario, who knows exactly, how that would play out? I mean, how do you think about it. And how do you think about how it would impact your business right I mean, given that pretty much everything you do is sort of multiyear in nature I mean, how do we think about that?
Mike Petters:  Well, thanks for the question, Ron. We, first of all, we made a decision very early on in this year that -- and I would say that it was a bit of a bad but I think it has paid off for us. And that is, that prior year obligated funds are just not going to be part of this discussion. And so, prior year obligated funds for us are all the ship contracts that we have and the design contracts that we have. And the backlog that Barb has talked about, we've got the contract signed at Ingalls that carries us out for the next few years. We've got contracts of Newport News that are going to carry us out for the next few years. And so, the near-term affect of sequestration as it exists, our sense of it is, it's not a near-term issue for HII. We are watching very closely the impact to our suppliers. We have 5,000 suppliers in all 50 states and those guys they're very careful about this, trying to predict how things are going to go and what investments they need to be making to support us. And so, we monitor that very closely, and if that -- so any affect from that would have a little bit of an effect on us. But for the most part, we're just working our way through that in terms of the near-term. I do think that there needs to be and their will be a discussion about how do we allocate the resources that we have for the needs that we have. And I think that debate is going to play out over the next couple of years. And that's really a discussion about what this company looks like in the 5 to 10 year timeframe. And so, we're going into a phase here over the next couple of years where Newport News is going to be signing a series of contracts, the new carrier construction contract, the next carrier refueling contract, the Block 4 submarine contract, the inactivation of Enterprise. We believe that all of those things will happen. I'm not sure that I would go and place a large wager on exactly when are they going to happen, because I think that when is going to be the part that gets kind of move the ships to get moved around in some of this discussion. But in the main there is an understanding by the taxpayers and the navy that these are capabilities that we have that are critical to our economic and national security. And so in that sense we're engaged in the discussion about what is that you need to do, when do you need to do it, and how do you get from where we are to where we want to be. And so that's a debate really about what does the company ultimately look like 5 or 10 years from now. And that's kind of the way we've been approaching it. We care deeply about our programs and our people and our supporting role for the Navy in its missions. We will care just as deeply about that on January 5th, as we do on December the 5th whether the log goes into effect or not and the case that we're making now is the same case that we'll be making after this log goes into effect or doesn't go into effect. And so that's kind of the way we've been thinking about it. I think that we've, it's turned out that we're probably right about the prior year obligated funds being not part of this discussion. And so that served us well this year. It's kind of kept our workforce focused in on the work that we've got, and it's given us a chance to kind of breathe our way through this in a rationale, I'd say unemotional way.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Yes, I just got one more. You there?
Mike Petters: Yeah.
Barb Niland: Yes.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Yes. Just one more question on I wanted to follow-up on LPD 26 and 27, because can you talk about the difference in the way those contracts work compared to your earlier ones?
Barb Niland: There is really not a big difference in the way the contracts work. It's really how we priced it and we priced it based on our current experience. And then, because the contracts are very similar they're both fixed price and -- say we're both fixed price instead of contracts. So it's based on, we priced it based on current performance and then from a work standpoint, we've put our operating system in place and we have a more diligent process where we go through this phase construction. And then the third piece of that, as Mike's talked about, we conservatively book on the front end due to the risk in front of us. And then as we retire that risk we improve so the margin rates going forward.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Yeah, because I guess my understanding was on LPD 22 through 25 and even the earlier ones that you would -- well the previous management had signed up for some pretty aggressive learning curves. And I was just curious how you were able to get to a point on 26 and 27 is it by virtue of continued improved performance or is it through better pricing and since more realistic pricing on these newer ships?
Mike Petters: Doug, I'd say all of the above. I mean the fact is that when we go to sign a contract with the navy, we are -- both parties are certifying that the pricing that is there is actually achievable. And there is lots of data when we go to sign LPD-26; there is a lots of data about what that pricing ought to be. And so that's one part of it. But the other part of it is, we're good stewards of the taxpayer dollars here. These operating systems that we put in place are serving us very, very well. The leadership team that has been built and is executing the programs on the Golf Coast is doing a fine job and we're very proud of the work that we're doing and we're very optimistic about the targets that we set, and our ability to achieve our long-term objectives.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over back to Mr. Mike Petters for closing remarks. Please proceed.
Mike Petters: Thank you. I just appreciate everybody joining us on the call this morning. As I said, I think today for us this is an historic day. We're initiating a dividend. We're initiating a stock buyback. In the history of the company today will be the day that we start with that and we're very, very excited about that. We said from the beginning that the number one objective over the next three years is to get those five ships delivered. We delivered another one this quarter that's exciting. We also took another one to acceptance trials just last week, and that's very exciting. And that would be three of the five ships by the end of this year will be out of the system. We are looking forward to next year and finishing that part of our process and then moving ahead and continuing to create more value for all of our stakeholders. So with that thanks for being with us today.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Petters: Thanks Andy. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on today’s call. I am pleased to report Huntington Ingalls Industries’ results for the second quarter of 2012. Today we reported sales of $1.72 billion, up 10.1% from the same period last year, and diluted earnings per share of $1.00, up from $0.80 in the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter segment operating margin was 7.4%, a significant improvement from 6.3% last year, and we ended the quarter with $669 million of cash on the balance sheet. Total backlog was $16.2 billion, of which $12.6 billion is funded. During the second quarter, we continued to execute well on all major programs at both Ingalls and Newport News, including achieving several milestones. At Ingalls, we launched two ships – the amphibious assault ship LHA-6 America, and LPD-25 Somerset. We successfully completed acceptance trials for LPD-23 Anchorage, a ship that will be delivered to the Navy next month, and we announced the construction contract for the newest amphibious assault ship, LHA-7 Tripoli. Subsequent to quarter-end, we announced the $1.5 billion construction contract for LPD-27, the 11th ship in the San Antonio class of LPDs.  At Newport News, the submarine and carrier programs continued to perform well and our outlook for these programs remains positive. In fact, we are in the preparation phase for a significant amount of new business, including the next block buy of submarines, the inactivation of CVN-65 Enterprise, the refueling of CVN-72 Lincoln, and the construction of CVN-79 Kennedy. Overall, our programs continue to perform in line with our expectations and we remain confident that we can deliver 9%-plus total operating margin by 2015. In the near term for the second half of 2012, we expect segment revenue and margins to be similar to the first half. Regarding the threat of sequestration, I don’t have much more to say on the subject as the potential negative impacts it will have on the industry, our workforce and our supply chain have been well-publicized, and while we hope that an alternative is found to avoid the automatic and indiscriminate spending cuts triggered sequestration, it is the law of the land. What we are doing is communicating to members of Congress and other leaders, along with our industry partners, about how this could impact us and we’re telling them that our supply chain – nearly 5,000 companies that span all 50 states – is at risk. They are likely to feel the impacts of sequestration much more rapidly than HII because their contracts and orders tend to cover much shorter periods than our longer term contracts. Our formula for success is continuing to perform well on our contracts and meeting all of our commitments on safety, quality, cost and schedule; and that’s what we focus on each and every day. Now to hit a few highlights of our major programs at Ingalls. As I mentioned earlier, LPD-23 Anchorage, constructed at our Avondale shipyard, has successfully completed acceptance trials and delivery should occur in September, about one month later than previously planned. The delay is due to the insulation of non-compliant bolts associated with certain propulsion system components. Although I am disappointed with the delay, I am proud that one of our own people identified the issue and that we are correcting it ourselves. We estimate the total cost of inspection and replacement to be less than $1 million. LPD-24 Arlington, being built in Pascagoula, is nearing completion and is scheduled to go to builder’s trials the week after next. Following builder’s trials, the ship will complete acceptance trials and then deliver to the Navy by the end of the year. LPD-25 Somerset, the last Navy ship scheduled to be built at the Avondale shipyard, was christened a little over a week ago and is scheduled to deliver next year. As Pascagoula, we continue to ramp up construction on LPD-26 John P. Murtha, and we just announced the construction contract award for LPD-27, the latest ship in the San Antonio class of LPDs. In June, we successfully launched LHA-6 America and we expect to deliver the ship in 2013. Performance on this program has been trending well, reflecting the outstanding efforts by the program team to improve efficiency and maintain high quality while controlling costs, and although significant risk remains as we move through the outfitting and testing phase, overall we are pleased with the progress on the ship. During the quarter, we also were awarded the $2.4 billion construction contract for LHA-7 Tripoli, the next America-class amphibious assault ship. Tripoli will be identical in all major respects to LHA-6, meaning it will have the same hybrid electric propulsion system and instead of a well deck will have additional hangar space and fuel storage in order to optimize its marine aviation capabilities. The National Security Cutter program continues to perform well and is a powerful example of the cost benefits of serial production. Construction is underway for the next two ships- NSC-4 and NSC-5 – and we are under a long-lead material contract for NSC-6. A construction contract for that ship is expected in 2013. Our Coast Guard customer is very pleased with the performance of the National Security Cutters and we look forward to supporting their future requirements as part of the recapitalization of the aging fleet. In the DDG-51 program, we are in the early stages of construction of DDGs 113 and 114, and we expect these ships to perform well. Like the NSC program, the DDG-51s are another good example of serial production and we expect these and subsequent ships to reflect the cost benefits of the Ingalls operating system. The next contract award of DDG-51 should be nine or ten ships split between us and our competitor with the final award likely in 2013. On the DDG-1000 Zumwalt class destroyer program, we have delivered the four aft PVLS modules and the composite hangar for DDG-1000 and expect to deliver the composite deck house later this year. Construction of the aft PVLS modules, hangar and deck house for DDG-1001 is underway and we are working with the Navy toward a contract for similar work on the next ship in the class, DDG-1002. At Avondale, we are proceeding with the plan to wind down the facility by the end of next year. The dedicated and highly skilled shipbuilders at Avondale have performed well on LPDs 23 and 25, and we are continuing to look for alternative ways to preserve those highly skilled jobs. Now turning to Newport News, CVN-78 Ford was 80% structurally erected and 43% complete at the end of the second quarter and is on pace to launch next year with delivery in 2015. Like every lead ship program, we’ve had to deal with labor and supply chain inefficiencies and issues around the development and insertion of new technologies; however as I’ve said before, Ford is the best lead ship program that I’ve seen during my career in shipbuilding. When Ford joins the fleet, it will be the most advanced and powerful warship ever constructed and will be a symbol of our nation’s commitment to a strong Navy. On CVN-79 Kennedy, the next carrier in the Ford class, we are ramping up construction preparation activities and anticipate having a construction contract in place sometime in 2013.  In submarines, performance on the Virginia class submarine program remains strong, making VCS one of the most successful DOD procurement programs. The close cooperation between us and our teaming partner coupled with the ramp-up to two submarines per year build rate has driven steady improvement in productivity and affordability. More efficient production also means these highly capable platforms join the fleet earlier than planned, which enables the Navy’s fleet commanders to better fulfill their missions. SSN-783 Minnesota, the last Block 2 submarine, and the next submarine to complete construction should launch late this year and deliver in mid-2013. The eight submarines of Block 3 are fully funded, and we expect a Block 4 contract award next year for at least nine additional submarines. The CVN-71 Roosevelt refueling and complex overhaul is on pace to meet its revised redelivery schedule of mid-2013. CVN-72 Lincoln, the next carrier scheduled for refueling, just completed its transit to Naval Station Norfolk and should come into the shipyard early next year. Similar to carrier and submarine construction, our COHs provide substantial long-term visibility and predictability as each carrier is refueled about 23 years after delivery. This facilitates better long-term planning and helps us to optimize our manning levels and material procurement. CVN-65 Enterprise, the world’s first nuclear aircraft carrier, was built at Newport News and for more than half a century has demonstrated the significant power projection of an aircraft carrier, having participated in virtually every major military action since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. She is currently on her final deployment and is expected to enter the yard in 2013 for inactivation and a defueling of its eight nuclear reactors. Overall, we are very pleased with where we stand on all of our major programs and our second quarter results reflect the steady progress our team is making toward achieving our long-term financial objectives. Before I turn the call over to Barb for more commentary on the financials, I’d like to make a few comments on how we manage our business in a way that maximizes value for our shareholders. As I’ve said before, in the near term we are focused on three primary mechanisms for creating value. First, to lock in key contracts. At the time of the spend, I mentioned that it was imperative that we finalize five key contracts critical to sustaining the business through 2015: LPDs 26 and 27, DDGs 113 and 114, and LHA-7. We have now been awarded all of these contracts plus an additional National Security Cutter – NSC-5 – which was awarded early. Second, to retire risk on existing programs, specifically risk related to our five underperforming contracts at Ingalls. In 2011, we delivered LPD-22 and we expect to deliver LPD-23 and LPD-24 in 2012. The remaining underperforming contracts – LPD-25 and LHA-6 – are on track for delivery next year. And third, to complete the closure of Avondale or, if possible, find an alternative use for the shipyard and its workforce. While we continue down the path of closure, we are still investigating other opportunities. As we successfully execute on these three levers, we improve our financial flexibility and strengthen our ability to deploy assets in a way that makes sense for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barb Niland: Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. I would like to briefly review our consolidated and segment results as disclosed in the press release. Turning to the financials on Slide 4 of the presentation, consolidated second quarter revenues were up 158 million or 10.1% compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven by higher volume across multiple business lines, including carrier construction, submarines and amphibious assault ships, which was partially offset by lower volume on carrier RCOH and fleet support service revenue at Newport News. I will provide more revenue detail in each segment report. Second quarter segment operating income was 127 million and total operating income was 106 million. Segment operating margin was 7.4%, up from 6.3% in 2011. Total operating margin was 6.2%, up 34 basis points from the same period last year. Total operating margin was impacted by 15 million higher pension expense offset by a slight decline in deferred state income taxes in 2012.  Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.00 compared to $0.80 for the second quarter 2011. The increase in EPS was driven by sales volume at both segments and margin improvement at Ingalls. We ended the quarter with a $669 million cash balance. Cash provided by operating activities was 151 million, a decline of 35 million over the same period last year. Capital expenditures were 30 million, up from 20 million in the second quarter last year, and are expected to fall in the high end of the 2 to 3% range for the year. Similar to last year, 2012 cash flow was significantly negative in the first quarter and is now trending positive. We expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the year, with the largest variables being timing of collections, timing of deliveries, and pension contributions compared to last year. Moving on to pension, the expected qualified pension contributions for the year have increased by 24 million to 236 million due to updated demographic data and our practice of maintaining our plans funded status to avoid benefit restrictions. During the first half of the year, we contributed 183 million to our pension plans and the remainder is expected to be weighted towards the third quarter. In addition, we have updated our FAS/CAS adjustment for 2012 to negative 74 million, down from negative 77 million we estimated at the end of last year. I will have more to say about 2013 pension expense on the Q3 call, but I did want to mention the pension funding relief legislation, which was recently signed into law. We expect this will provide significant flexibility to us regarding contributions starting in 2013, but it will not affect our expected 2012 contributions. We are currently analyzing all of the variables related to the legislation and should have more detail next quarter regarding our future pension contributions. Turning to Slide 5, Ingalls’ revenue for the second quarter increased 48 million or 6.8% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher sales on LHA-7 offset by lower sales on LHA-6. The LPD program remained constant for the quarter as higher sales on LPD-27 and LPD-25 were offset by lower sales on LPD-24 and LPD-22 following the deliver of LPD-22 in Q4 of 2011. The NSC program remained flat due to lower sales following the delivery of NSC Stratton in 2011 offset by higher sales on the construction of NSC-4 and NSC-5, as well as the advanced procurement contract on NSC-6. Ingalls’ operating income for the quarter was 38 million compared with 19 million in the same period of 2011. Operating margin was 5% for the quarter, up from 2.7% last year. The increase was the result of lower net unfavorable performance adjustments in the LPD program for the quarter as compared to 2011, and during the quarter Ingalls received 7 million for the resolution of a contract dispute with a private party which was a direct contribution to operating income. Turning to Slide 6, Newport News’ revenue for the quarter increased 107 million or 12.3% from the second quarter 2011. It was primarily driven by higher volume on CVN-78, CVN-79, the Lincoln RCOH, the advanced planning efforts on the Enterprise inactivation, and the VCS program as it transitions to building two boats per year. These increases were partially offset by lower sales on the Roosevelt RCOH and lower fleet support services primarily due to the redelivery of the submarine USS Albany in 2011. Newport News’ operating income for the quarter was 89 million compared with 79 million in the second quarter last year. Operating margin was 9.1% for the quarter, flat to prior year. The increase in operating income was driven by higher sales volume and the impact of performance improvements on the VCS program. Last, interest expense for the second quarter was 29 million and the effective tax rate was 35.1%. For the full year 2012, we now estimate deferred state tax expense should run about 8 million, interest expense should be roughly 118 million, and our tax rate should be close to 35%. That wraps up my remarks, and with that I’ll turn the call over to Andy for Q&A.
Andy Green: Thanks Barb. Just a reminder to everyone – if you could limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up, and then get back in the queue so we can accommodate as many people as possible. And with that, Chantele, I’d like to turn it over to you to manage the Q&A.
Operator: Sure. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Morning, Sam.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Mike, you said that you thought the second half of this year would be relatively similar in terms of revenue and earnings as the first half. I’m just looking—if I look last year, you saw much steeper step-up in the second half of the year where the second half was much stronger. What’s different there as to why we’re not going to see a pickup in the second half? I know the pension steps up a little bit, but just trying to think about the moving pieces there.
Mike Petters: Yeah, I’d say first of all, last year and this year are a little bit different in that the risk profile that we were working our way through last year was very different than it is now. You know, we’ve retired—as we’ve been going quarter by quarter, we’ve been retiring some of that risk that was in front of us last year, and frankly the second half of last year was when we retired some of that risk, so that opportunity may not necessarily be quite the same this year. Secondly, I think if you look at what happened in the first half of this year, I think Barb always talks about the lumpiness of our business. I think if you look at the first two quarters of this year, you see the lumpiness of our business. The second quarter, we achieved several significant milestones in the second quarter and it made it a very, very high-end kind of quarter for us; but if you look back over the last six months and we look forward for the next six months, we think that they’re pretty similar at this point.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Okay. And then Barb, you mentioned the $7 million receipt in the quarter. Can you just sum up the other (inaudible) adjustments just in terms of what the benefits were in this quarter?
Barb Niland: Sure. You’ll see when the Q comes out that the positive adjustments were 60 million, which includes that 7, and the other positive things were we had a couple of the boats on VCS performance adjustments there, and also on LPD-23 and 25 we were seeing favorable performance there to the prior adjustments we had made. And then on the negative adjustment side, that’s $26 million and that’s primarily driven by LPD-24 and a little bit of LPD-22.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Okay, thank you.
Barb Niland: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Good morning. So Mike, I have to say you sound good. There’s a lot of confidence I detect there, having known you for a long time, and I can see the pride in the progress that’s been made down in the Gulf Coast. So that being the case, should we think about this, based on what you just said to Sam about the second half, when we strip out the 7 million you did 4.1% down there. Is that at this point a sustainable margin?
Mike Petters: Yeah, I think that I’ll just stay with what I’ve already said – that the first half is reflective of how the second half is going to go. I think that what you have to really look at, Rob, is that we are ticking off the events that we laid out and said that these are the risk retirement events that we have to accomplish. We really accomplished several of those events in second quarter. You know, we had a couple of launchings in there, a couple of trials. Second quarter was a very high paced activity, and so to go so far as to say that we’ve got it completely contained and sustainable, I’m not ready to go do that yet. But I am very, very pleased with the way that the team has rallied over the last—I mean, we’d say year and a half, but Barb and I sometimes think that this has been a four and a half year journey for us. We’re in a good place right now and we fully expect to continue to retire the risk and move ahead over the next 18 months.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay, well that’s helpful. Barb, maybe from just the way you book these favorables and unfavorables, is your methodology to take a (inaudible) catch and then recognize all of that in the current quarter, or do you something more akin to what we’ve seen from your competitor which is to take a modest amount of that favorable and the remainder of it through the end of the contract, in other words spreading it more evenly, meaning that is this quarter a little—I think to what Mike just said, perhaps this is the peak for the year because these events happen now.
Barb Niland: Well, no. When we do a (inaudible) catch-up, that same booking rate continues for the remainder of the program unless we have another milestone that affects our booking rate up or down. We have a very rigorous process with a schedule of events and costs associated—cost performance associated along the way with those events, and so we very deliberately make changes in our booking rates.
Mike Petters: Yeah Rob, I would add that one of the key tenets of the systems that we’ve put in place at Ingalls over the last four and a half years is we’ve taken the entire risk register and we’ve attached all of the items in the risk register to specific key events, and when we come through that key event, we do a hot wash on did we retire the risk, did we mitigate it. If we didn’t retire it, is there another opportunity to do that? And so that’s why the events are important to us because that’s our chance to do a real-time update on where do we stand on the risk in that program.  Frankly, that’s why Ingalls has—in my view, that’s why we feel so good about where we’ve been, and we are optimistic about where we’re going. But it also is we still have real clear line of sight on the risk that’s still out there between now and the delivery of the last four ships and the closure of Avondale. We are keeping our eye on all of that.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just to finish up on Avondale, if you stick with your plan to wind down and nothing happens differently, and understanding that you’re hoping for a different outcome, but if it goes this way, Barb, are there any events we should be looking out for the remainder of this year and ’13 that hit the books?
Barb Niland: No. You will see when the Q is filed that we reduced our restructuring costs from 271 million down to 265, and that difference is actually a reduction in our estimated cash outlays and we talked about that, that it would be negotiated based on actual. So as we’re incurring the actuals, we update our proposal so that’s about the only thing you’ll see. But right now, everything is on schedule as planned.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you both.
Barb Niland: You’re welcome. Have a good day.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Good morning. On LHA-6 and LPD-25, could you update us on the timing next year when you expect those deliveries? And then related to that, since you’ve launched these ships, would I be correct to assume that the risks that you’ve been talking about – either upside or downside – that band should be narrowing somewhat now that these ships are in the water?
Mike Petters: Okay. First of all regarding schedule, I would at this point just say second half of next year for both of those ships. We just christened the Somerset and will be christening the America on October. And so the second half of next year is when we’re looking at the delivery of those ships, and they’ll go through the whole trial sequence and everything else. 
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: That’s later than you had thought, isn’t it, before?
Mike Petters: You know, I think that what we’ve been doing is we’ve—I think it is later than we had originally laid out a couple of years ago; but again, I think as we’ve been working our way through this, we’ve been adjusting the schedule to reflect our better understanding of what the risk profile is. That’s part of what our challenge over the past couple of years has been.  Both of those ships are in pretty good shape. I mean, I’m pleased with the quality of the launch on Somerset and I’m particularly pleased with what the team on America is doing. They’re basically working through a new design program there with a significant engineering change, and they got the ship in the water early. It was a quality launch, and so I’m excited about where that’s going.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: And then if I can on Virginia class, as you move through Block 3, I would assume that you would expect margins to improve as you move down the learning curve. I’m curious where you are today on Block 3 Virginia class relative to your plan of margins.
Mike Petters: We’re basically on our plan. I would point out that the learning curve on these programs is starting to get pretty flat ship-over-ship because doubling the volume now takes a whole lot more ships than it used to in the learning curve. But in terms of our financial plan, we are performing very well against our financial plan on all of those programs, on all of the Virginia class program.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
Mike Petters: Morning George.
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research: Good morning. Question for you - is about 40% of the revenues at Ingalls now still at zero margin?
Barb Niland: It’s a little less than that. It’s less than that.
Mike Petters: Yeah, we think it’s a little less than that. 
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research: Okay. So then it would appear that the margin of the core business was improved a little bit this quarter from what you’ve had in the past. If you could explain—well, I guess you kind of explained where you took the improvements, but is that a sustainable thing?
Barb Niland: Well George, you know, as we talked before, on all our new programs we are starting at a lower margin rate until we see progress on each of those ships and performance, like Mike talked about, against each one of those milestones. But like we said, the first half of the year is going to look like the second half.
Mike Petters: I guess what I would say, George, in the same way that we allocated all of the risk registered to key events on our five underperforming programs, we do that on all of our programs and so as we’ve been saying for a while, we expect the blended rate of this business across the portfolio of all of our programs to be operating in the 9%-plus range. Our challenge at Ingalls is that the ships that should be operating above that are not performing, and so that’s created a hole in the blend As we retire the risk and deliver those ships, you will see the margins improve at Ingalls in the rest of the business but they’re only going to improve at the rate at which we retire risk on the new programs and get them up to the level of maturity that they need to be. And so that’s going to be a bit lumpy because it’s about when does the program start, when do you start fab, when did the contract get signed, when is the material coming in. And so it’s going to be a little bit more bumpy than you would think, and you’re going to have a lot more visibility on that than you usually do because you won’t see the full blended rate. So that’s kind of what you’re seeing right now.
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research: But specifically, Mike, did it go up a little bit this quarter if you look at the aggregate of the profitable programs?
Barb Niland: Well, that’s because of the delivery of LPD-22, so you took one of the ships and a forward loss out of there.
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research: Okay. Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.
Pete Skibitski – Drexel Hamilton: Good morning. Mike, just wonder if you could add some more color in terms of your thoughts on the potential impact of sequestration to HII. Do you think they would sort of spread the cuts out over all of your programs, or would you expect to have one large program outright cancelled? Just wondering what your thoughts are there.
Mike Petters: Well, first of all I think that a core part of our view on sequestration is that obligated prior year funds, the ships that are on contract today, are going to stay on contract. I just don’t think—and maybe I’m the naïve one in the room, but I just don’t think that there’s any practical way for there to be any savings generated by trying to go in and reduce scope or cancel or terminate any of the programs for contracts that have already been signed, and so that’s why we, frankly, have focused so hard on getting those five big contracts signed so that we could get those under contract going into next year. We do think that sequestration could have some effect on the timing of future work for us. The debate about whether it’s a budget authority cut or is it an outlays cut, and how is the government going to work their way through that, I’ve seen really smart folks argue both sides of that. There hasn’t been any real clear guidance provided as to how that’s going to go. It makes it really hard to plan. I would expect that programs could be moved around a little bit to adjust to whatever the law is, but I would remind you that if you stepped back and said, what are the Navy’s top four priority programs in terms of shipbuilding? It’s the four programs we’re involved in, and so I don’t really see today anybody stepping out and saying we’re going to go and terminate one of these whole classes of ships or stop or curtail production of anything, because these production lines are pretty warm right now and they’re working very well, and we know from history that if you ever curtail one of these programs, it will be too expensive to restart again. So the timing of our future work may be something that gets caught up in the discussion. I don’t believe the actuality of any of the programs that are out there is at any greater risk than it normally would be anyway, and so that’s why we’ve been able to say that the work we have under contract carries us through the next three to five years of work and that the timing of future work over the next couple years, the contracts we have to sign, that’s really why the—that’s the time period in the five to 10-year time frame of work for us, and that’s really been the basis of our commentary on that altogether.  Beyond that, though, I’d say our supply chain and our suppliers, they have a little bit different view. They supply not just to us but they supply to the whole industry, and the supply chain has been dwindling and weakening, I’d say, over the last several years to the point where the vast majority of our supply chain now is either sole source or single source suppliers. Their ability to plan, their ability to forecast is even less—they have less visibility than we do, and so we expect the supply chain to be challenged over this next time frame.
Pete Skibitski – Drexel Hamilton: That’s great color. I appreciate that. If I could add just one follow up to Barb on pension – hey Barb, if you had your year-to-date, your return on assets and your plan and peg your discount rate, I was just wondering, number one, how much would your discount rate change by, and sort of directionally how you would expect your FAS and CAS expense to move for 2013.
Barb Niland: Okay, so I’m not going to give anything on 2013, but let me tell you what – our return on assets year-to-date for the end of the quarter were 5.5%. And then as far as—I’ll give you some sensitivities, though. From a discount rate standpoint, a 25 basis point increase would be about a $17 million increase, and if it goes the other way, it’s about $18 million, okay, on a 25 basis point. And then on return on assets, you’re about on a 25 basis point about $8 million of change in FAS.
Pete Skibitski – Drexel Hamilton: Okay. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Please proceed.
John – Citi:  Hi, good morning. This is John (Inaudible) in for Jason. Thanks for taking the question. Just a question on cash flows. Operation cash flows came in a little bit light this quarter, lower than what you were expecting. I know Barb mentioned that you expect the trend upward over the year. I was wondering if you can give an idea of the outlook for the year in terms of magnitude, how—what kind of swing we can get over the course of the year, and then perhaps just some vision out to ’13, and then ’14 assuming that Avondale closure goes to plan.
Barb Niland: Okay, not going to provide anything on ’13 or ’14 yet – sorry about that. But I talk about this all the time – cash, I expect the same trend as last year, but again it will all be based on timing of collections because we have big invoices. One day makes a difference when you close the year. Timing of deliveries – again, the 23 and 24 out and get the DD-250 signed off and billing our customer and getting paid. They’re really the two biggest drivers, so I don’t expect any issues on the deliveries with 23 and 24. And then I’m not smart enough to call who’s going to pay us on the last day of the year and the first day of 2013, so you’ve got to bear with us on that. It’s just the way it is and hard to predict.
John – Citi: Fair enough. And then just a quick follow-up on CVN-79 negotiations. I wonder if maybe you could provide an update on the progress there and just address some of the risk, if there is any, on how a longer negotiation process might impact expected margins since it’s a growing business and one would assume that risk is coming off the table, even though you still don’t have that full contract.
Mike Petters: Yeah, I think everybody is kind of preparing for the negotiations right now. The Navy is working through their scope of the job that we’re coming through, the estimates we’re taking a look at, the cost returns we see on 78. The Navy is working through the budget issues, so all of that stuff is ongoing. It’s about where it typically is for this kind—you know, we’re probably a year away from really having that in the final stages of negotiation. So it’s kind of where it ought to be. I think that the challenge that the 79 presents is going to be we’re moving from 78 to 79. We expect that we’ll move from a cost-type environment to a price-type environment and we will not have finished 78, and so there will be that kind of calculation that we’ll be going through as we go to contract. That will be a tough one for us with the Navy as well. I mean, they’ll have their constraints, we’ll have our constraints, and we’ll go into the room and we’ll try to figure out to get a contract wrapped around it. We’ve always been able to do that, and we fully expect to be able to do that again.
John – Citi: Great, thanks for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Good morning.
Mike Petters: Hi Myles, how are you doing?
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: Good, good. Just maybe a follow-up on the CVN-79 question. Is it still looking—I think from your slide, you’re still looking at a 2020 delivery, and I think from the most recent (inaudible) it would suggest that 2022, and obviously we’re talking way out there in time and space. But how does that look to you – is it a stretch-out, or is there something else that’s going on?
Mike Petters: Well I’d say there’s probably two things that are going on there, Myles. One of them is how does it fit with the fleet requirements, and so when does the Navy need the ship in the fleet to maintain their four structure in 11. I think they’ve got a little bit of flexibility around that. You know, they’re operating at 10 right now, and so all the carrier deployments are being stretched out. We just saw a carrier on the west coast get accelerated to deploy a few months early to meet its requirements, and so the op tempo is really high right now and I think there is just some trying to figure out how are we going to maintain when we get back to 11 after Ford delivers, how are we going to operate and keep the four structure at 11, and how does 79 fit into that discussion. So I think that’s part of what you see in some of those documents. I think the second thing you see in those documents is a bit of a reflection on the lead ship nature of 78. While it’s come together better than any lead ship I’ve seen, we’ve got significantly more pre-outfitting when the units go into the dock. The team is—you know, the whole thing has gelled a whole lot better than we usually see on a lead ship at this point.  We’ve had some challenges with the usual kind of churn that you see in lead ships around material, particularly valve suppliers and things like that, and there are some pressure and some thought in some quarters that maybe what we do as we stretch it out, we allow ourselves to get some of those technical issues completely sorted out in order to support a better schedule.  My own view of it is that a shipbuilder always has to make the trade-off between are we ready to go to the dock with the unit that’s missing valves, or do we wait for the valves. Typically we get to a point where we need to put the unit in the dock even if we don’t have the valves, and so that’s sort of the discussion that’s going on and I think that’s why you see some of that band of when the ship might be needed by the fleet and when it might be delivered, and how do we retire some of the risk associated with the new technology we’re seeing coming through on 78, so.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: The one thing I’m curious about is at this point, though, it would seem like there is no risk to learning curve loss as a result of the potential delays from here. Where does that become a risk? If it’s 2024, then we have kind of a learning risk erosion potential, or--?
Mike Petters: Well, I guess in my experience the optimum gap between carriers is between three and a half and four years. Once you move past that, you start to lose a little bit. I mean, think about what you’re talking—even at four years, if you carry the bal unit of the ship into the dock and then four years later you’re going to do that again. Now, the bal unit is a very irregular shaped unit, very precise craftsmanship goes into that. A team forms to go do that. They go do it, and then they’re going to do it four years again—four years later, we’re going to do it again. Even in that, it might be a bit of a stretch to say that there is a substantial amount of learning carryover from one ship to the next.  And so yeah, there’s a lot of pieces that you can kind of go from one ship right into the next piece of it. I think once you go—I think five years that the Pentagon has cited as how they want to build these things is something we can manage. I would point out that the gap between 77 and 78 was—I believe it was six years, and that did—you know, we had some challenges there. The best carriers in terms of learning that we ever built were when we built them on two-ship contracts. We had two two-ship contracts. It was—let’s see, 72 and 73 were on one contract, and 74 and 75 were on another contract, and they were two ships over ten years and we could go right from one to the next. The supply chain was lined up. It was serial production of aircraft carriers and it was at its best. I think that every time you put another year in to delay the contract award or you do something, you are absolutely affecting the efficiency of the operation and you are raising the price to the taxpayers.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: Okay, and then just two clean-up questions. One – Barb, you gave us some of the sensitivities for FAS/CAS for ’13, but where is the starting point if all else were being held constant for ’13 to those sensitivities?
Barb Niland: We’re going to talk about that in Q3.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: All right. I figured camel’s nose was already under the tent; might as well put the whole body in there.
Mike Petters: Nice try!
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: Yeah, sure. And then the other clean-up one is, Mike, you mentioned still pursuing alternate uses for Avondale, but curious what kind of timeline you could continue to evaluate those alternatives, given the time to the end date of closing it down is a year, 18 months away.
Mike Petters: Yeah, Myles, the most important asset we have in that facility is the workforce that’s there, and every week that goes by, every month that goes by, the volume of workforce, the number of people that are working is going down. And so the value of that asset in terms of how much we can go, that sort of creates a clock that’s ticking, as you point out. I don’t know that we’ve come and said that there’s an absolute—we have to close if we get to this point if we don’t have any other option. I don’t think we’ve made that call yet. I think that we are hopeful that we will be able to drive this thing to some other outcome. But the reality is that if we end up continuing to execute the plan that we have for closure, once it’s closed we won’t stop looking for ways to redeploy that asset, and so it will just shift to a different –we’ll just move to a different phase.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ruttenbur of CRT Capital. Please proceed.
Brian Ruttenbur – CRT Capital:  Thank you very much. Great quarter. I have a question on G&A on the year, the dollar amount; and then book to bill for the year, if you could answer those, where you estimate both of those by year-end.
Barb Niland: Okay, so let’s talk about the G&A first. I expect it to look pretty close to where it is year-to-date, okay, so double it. And you know, the biggest thing in the G&A that’s driving it is really the FAS/CAS is in there for us, okay? So that’s the G&A. And then your other question is the book to bill ratio – probably going to go—I’m thinking we got 27 after the quarter, and then if you look and you take our sales volume that we’ve talked about, doubling it, it will really depend on what happens with the continuing resolution and how all our engineering and services contracts get funded at the end of the year. It may go down slightly, but I think it all depends.
Brian Ruttenbur – CRT Capital:  Okay. And then the Avondale – is there anything that the state can do at this point to stop you from shutting that operation down?
Mike Petters: I don’t have a contract with the state, you know? I mean, we have contracts to the state to build ships. If the state wanted to give us a contract to go do some other kind of work, I guess that they could stop us that way; but it would be because we had work to do. There’s no regulatory thing that they can do, there’s no legal thing that they can do that would stop it. Frankly, the State of Louisiana has been a very effective partner with us in trying to find ways to redeploy the asset. Last year, the governor and I came together and agreed that the State would come forward with a couple of hundred million dollars of incentives for any sort of potential partner to put into that asset, so this isn’t really about the political process trying to stop the loss of jobs. The political process has been a partner with us to try to find ways to redeploy the asset.
Brian Ruttenbur – CRT Capital:  Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mayur Manmohansingh of Barclays. Please proceed.
Mayur Manmohansingh – Barclays: Hi, good morning guys. Good quarter. I just had one question – you maintained earlier the 9%-plus margin target by 2015, but in talking about the contract that you’ve won, that should carry your revenues to 2015. You were pointing out that you got an additional NCS – National Security Cutter – in addition to your sort of earlier plans. So I was just wondering – I mean, it sounds like this just—that there’s some upside to your prior revenue forecast for—I think it was for flat over the 2010 levels. Does that sound about right?
Mike Petters: I mean, we’re going to stay with that simply because if you take the National Security Cutter, the most important part of the National Security Cutter award was the Coast Guard recognized the value of serial production, and they wanted to keep the line moving so they could keep their price down. If you take the price of a National Security Cutter and you spread it out over the five-year period, it’s not going to substantially affect our outlook over the time frame, and in the main we have lots of pluses and minuses like this that are all going to average out, which is why Barb and I have said from the very beginning that the way to look at our business is that the revenue is flat but the earnings will expand. And that’s been our objective, that’s what we’ve been trying to get done, and so far we’ve been on track for that.
Mayur Manmohansingh – Barclays:  Okay, great. And just one other follow-upon Avondale, just kind of coming back to Myles’ question earlier – just wondering, in terms of the closure of Avondale, are there any contentious items outstanding, I want to say with the Navy, in terms of what they will cover if you were to end up just closing the facility? I’m just wondering if there’s anything contentious left.
Mike Petters: No. I mean, the FARF spells out the allowability of the costs that we are putting into our effort, and all of that is pretty well defined. As Barb said, we started with estimates for what those costs would be. When this is all said and done, we’ll probably end up negotiating it around the actuals, but I would point out that the Navy has also been a partner with us in trying to find a way to redeploy the asset. We’ve said in order to redeploy this asset, we need four things: we would need the Navy to work with us, we would need the State and the political process to work with us, we would need a partner, and a sustainable credible market. Well, we’ve got the State and the Navy – they’re right there with us, helping us in every which way they can. We continue to look for a partner and a market.
Mayur Manmohansingh – Barclays: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mike Petters for closing remarks. Please proceed, sir.
Mike Petters: Thank you, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As I said 18 months ago, I guess, we said we needed to get five contracts signed. We’ve gotten those five contracts signed. We told you that we needed to get five ships delivered. We’ve delivered one; we’re on the edge of delivering the second. We will have the third delivered by the end of this year and we’re on track to deliver the fourth and fifth ones next year, and so that’s on pace. And we said that we would be working our way through the closure and/or redeployment of Avondale, and the closure plan remains in effect and we continue to think about redeployment. You know, we’re very excited about the steps that we have taken. We recognize that we still have a long ways to go. We’re very proud of the work that we’ve done, and we look forward to continuing to move ahead on our plan. Thanks for being with us this morning, and we look forward to seeing you on the street.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings conference call. My name is Montoya and I’ll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andy Green, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Andy Green: Thanks, Montoya. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barb Niland, Corporate Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer.  As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in their remarks today, Mike and Barb will refer to segment operating income, a non-GAAP measure. Reconciliation of this metric to the comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website.  We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments.

With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Petters: Thanks, Andy. Morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I am pleased to report Huntington Ingalls Industries results for the first quarter of 2012.  Today, we reported first quarter sales of $1.57 billion, down 6.9% from the same period last and earnings per share of $0.67, down from $0.92 in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter segment operating margin was 6.4%, a significant improvement from 5.0% last year and we ended the quarter with $551 million of cash on the balance sheet, in line with what we told you on the fourth quarter call.  Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $15.5 billion compared with $17.4 billion last year.  Now, it's only been about six weeks since our last call so not much has changed with respect to our major programs or outlook. That being said, overall it was a good quarter for us and one that reflects the dedication, talent and commitment of our 38,000 shipbuilders.  Newport News continues to execute on major programs such as construction of the Navy's newest aircraft carrier, Ford, construction of Virginia-class submarines and the overhaul of Roosevelt, while preparing for construction of Kennedy, the refueling of Lincoln and the inactivation of Enterprise.  At Ingalls, we continue to make significant progress towards delivering the legacy LPDs and LHA-6 America, while securing new business in amphibious ships, national security cutters and destroyers. With two legacy ship deliveries this year, and the remaining two scheduled for next year, the Ingalls team is closing in on returning margins to normal and sustainable levels.  Overall, we are on track to deliver our goal of 9%-plus total operating margin in 2015 on a flat revenue base. Now, before I get into more detail about our individual programs, I'd like to make a few comments on the defense environment, the budget and how we're proactively managing our business in the face of continued uncertainty.  Remember that because of the long duration of our contracts, the majority of the programs we're working on today and for the next few years are already in backlog having been funded under previous appropriations. So when we look at major program decisions and budgeting, generally speaking this impacts our revenue not this year or next but a few years out.  Now earlier this year the Administration announced a strategic shift to the Pacific and the subsequent budget request reflected the priorities necessary to support the new strategy. As we said on the last call, the budget request was generally supportive of Navy programs including the construction of Kennedy, nine Block 4 submarines, nine DDG-51s and the Lincoln refueling.  As we expected there was less support in amphibious ships with LHA-8 being pushed out a year and LSDX delayed two years, two programs which are critical to the Navy's and Marine Corp's ability to accomplish their missions.  The potential for sequestration, however, clouds the outlook for defense spending although it is difficult to say much about it given it is unclear as to it would be implemented. And despite all the commentary from industry and government about sequestration and the negative affects it could have on the US industrial base and our military's ability to meet its commitments, so far nothing definitive has happened to change the prospects of it occurring.  Now amidst all the external uncertainty around defense spending, internally we are aggressively managing our existing programs, pursuing cost reduction initiatives and looking for innovative ways to improve ship affordability. Every day we work closely with our partners, the US Navy and the US Coast Guard, to ensure that the ships they need to accomplish their missions are more affordable, provide the required capabilities, are of high quality and our delivered on schedule.  At both Ingalls and Newport News, we are constantly evaluating ways to reduce the cost of building the finest and most advanced warships in the world without sacrificing the 126-year old tradition of high quality and performance that our customers have come to expect.  This includes reducing overhead, more efficiently managing the highly complex and nationwide shipbuilding supply chain, improving learning curve efficiencies, boosting labor productivity and maximizing the significant benefits of serial production.  Two good examples of this are the Virginia-class submarine and the National Security cutter programs where we've combined detailed consistent class planning with strong quality management and program oversight to achieve true serial production, which maximizes learning curve efficiencies and makes these highly capable ships more affordable for our customers.  The submarine and cutter programs are just examples. We are applying these concepts across the company, which we believe will result in a more efficient organization that fully supports the Navy and Coast Guard shipbuilding objectives.  So now I'll just hit a few highlights of our major programs. LPD's 23 and 24 should go to sea trials in the next few months and we expect to deliver both ships some time in late summer or fall. We successfully launched LPD-25 last month and are continuing to ramp up construction of LPD-26. We are working under a long lead material contract for LPD-27 and expect to finalize the construction contract for LPD-27 in the near future.  LHA-6 America remains on schedule to launch early this summer and deliver next year and we are in the process of negotiating a contract for the next America class amphibious assault ship, LHA-7, which the Navy just recently named Tripoli.  In the NSC program, we were awarded a long lead material contract award for NSC-6 and expect a construction contract for NSC-6 in 2013.  CVN-78 Ford is now 76% structurally erected. The program remains on track and the ship is on schedule for launch in 2013 with expected delivery in 2015. We are in the construction preparation phase for CVN-79 Kennedy and expect to have a construction contract in place some time in 2013. In submarines, we expect to launch Minnesota, the last Block 2 submarine late this year with expected delivery in mid-2013. We expect a contract award for Block 4 in 2013 for at least nine boats to be built between 2014 and 2018.  Now looking ahead to the rest of 2012, we don't see any changes to what we discussed on the last call. We expect stable performance out of Newport News relative to 2011 and modest segment operating margin improvement at Ingalls. Overall, this year should look like 2011 on the top line, although segment operating margin should show some improvement.  In summary, we began 2012 with results right in line with our expectations and subject to potential sequestration or long-term outlook is unchanged. Our backlog remains healthy and should increase significantly over the next 24 months as our new business pipeline contains LHA-7, LPD-27, at least nine Virginia-class Block 4 submarines, CVN-79 construction, the Enterprise inactivation and the construction of multiple DDG-51s.  Although defense budgets are under pressure, we believe we are well positioned across multiple platforms to support or Nation's naval strategy. Our entire company is intensely focused on providing affordable, high quality ships for our customers and we are firmly committed to creating value for our shareholders.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barb Niland: Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. I would like to briefly review our consolidated and segment results as disclosed in the press release.  Turning to the financials on Slide 4 of the presentation, reported first quarter sales were down 6.9% compared to the same period last year. The decrease was mainly driven by lower volume following the delivery of NSC-3 and LPD-22 in 2011 and lower volume on the Roosevelt RCOH and VCS program. These were partially offset by higher volume on the construction preparation on Kennedy and the advanced planning on the Lincoln RCOH. First quarter segment operating income was $101 million and total operating income was $80 million. Segment operating margin was 6.4%, up from 5% in 2011. Total operating margin was 5.1%, up only slightly from the same period last year due primarily to $13 million higher pension expense and the $9 million difference in deferred state taxes in 2012. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.67 compared to $0.92 for the first quarter 2011. The decline in EPS was driven mainly by higher interest expense, pension expense and deferred taxes. In line with what we said in the fourth quarter call, we ended the quarter with $551 million in cash. Cash used in operating activities was $329 million, and improvement of $35 million over the same period last year.  Generally, we are cash users in the first quarter and this trend reverses over the remaining three quarters. We saw that in 2011 and expect a similar pattern in 2012. Additionally, during the first quarter we contributed $122 million to our pension plans, approximately 50% of our expected full year contribution. We expect the remainder of our 2012 pension contributions to be weighted towards the second and third quarters.  Capital expenditures were $27 million, down from $63 million in the first quarter last year. As a reminder, capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2011 included a $36 million reimbursement to the State of Louisiana for a cooperative endeavor agreement associated with the wind down of the Avondale Shipyard.  Turning to Slide 5, Ingalls revenues for the first quarter of 2012 decreased $69 million or 9.1% from the same period of last year driven primarily by the delivery of NSC-3 and LPD-22 in 2011. Ingalls operating income for the quarter was $20 million compared with $17 million in the same period in 2011. Ingalls operating margin was 2.9% for the quarter, up from 2.2% last year driven by the delivery of LPD-22 San Diego.  Turning to Slide 6, Newport News revenues for the quarter decreased $45 million or 4.8% from the first quarter 2011 primarily driven by lower volume on the Roosevelt RCOH and the VCS program. This was offset by higher volume on the construction preparation contract for Kennedy and advanced planning efforts on the Lincoln RCOH.  Newport News operating margin for the quarter was $81 million compared with $67 million in the first quarter last year. Operating margin was 9.1% for the quarter compared to 7.1% in the first quarter 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by the one-time negative adjustment in Q1 last year of approximately $9 million on the Ford contract and additional risk reduction on the VCS program.  Interest expense for the first quarter was $30 million and the effective tax rate was 34%, both in line with our expectations.  That wraps up my remarks, and with that I'll turn the call over to Andy for Q&A. 
Andy Green: Thanks, Barb. Just as a reminder to everyone, we request that you limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up. And always are welcomed to get back in the queue for any additional questions so we can get as many as possible.  With that, I'll turn it over you, Montoya, to manage the Q&A.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays Capital. Please proceed. 
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital:  Good morning, Andy, Mike and Barb. Just – I know this is a tough topic to address but I wondered if you could talk a little bit about sequestration and scenarios you're evaluating and how shipbuilding may differ from other programs that we'd see at your peers and things like overhead flexibility or the lack thereof. Or how we should think about the impact of long-term funding and perhaps unspent funds that you could live on a little bit longer than programs that are incrementally funded. And lastly, if there are scenarios in your mind that could push programs into a (inaudible) position where we could see stop work orders or anything like that. Anything you're evaluating as you kind of think about scenarios. Any color you could provide would be really helpful. 
Mike Petters: Sure. Gosh. That’s a wide open question so let me see if I can bring a little bit of color to it. Thanks for the question. We've said from the beginning that this prospect of sequestration, it's out there, but the vast majority of the work that we need to do in the next three to five years to achieve the objectives that we've been talking about for the last year, we have under contract. We really have two more contracts to get, the LHA-7 and the LPD-27 contract. We're close on those. We've just got to get those finished. Those are really the last two of the original set of contracts that we talked about a year ago that really push us out to the three to five-year timeframe.  And our focus in that body of work is to retire the risk that we have in some of our heritage work. The LPD-2 delivery was a big milestone for us at the end of last year. This summer is going to be a big risk retirement summer for us with the launch of America, the sea trials and ultimate deliveries of LPD-23 and 24.  We're in a place now where a big part of what we've been working on to retire risk, we're heading into the zone where it's time to get it retired. Relative to the law and the sequestration, I don't know that I have any other particular insight in it than anybody else does. A whole lot of folks say that ultimately this is not going to happen but a whole lot of folks also say they have no idea how it may not happen.  Or if it does happen, it's going to have some different effect or maybe a reduced effect. There are a whole host of initiatives but it doesn't appear to me anyway that there's any sense that there's some kind of an arrangement that's going to come out before the election that’s going to bring any more clarity to this.  In our view we step back and our business, we have the advantage of really seeing the whole might of America come to bear in our shipyards. We have to invest in our workforce. We have to invest in our facilities and our tooling and our plant. And we have to support our supply chain. Our workforce comes to us and we make significant investments in them over time.  The prospect of sequestration gives us pause as to what kind of investment we would need to be making over a period of time. When you step back and say that it takes – it might take eight years to create a nuclear pipe fitter in Newport News, the question you have to ask yourself as you're starting that process today is what's the real prospect there and what's the return on that? So we're thinking our way through that sort of thing. When you step back and think about capital investment in our facilities, now you're thinking about how do you invest in your core business when you're not really sure what the core business is going to look like the day after tomorrow. And so we're thinking very carefully about that.  And then when you take a look at our supply chain, we have 5,000 suppliers across in virtually every state. This supply chain already in shipbuilding has been thinned over the past several years. Roughly on the order of about 60% of our supply chain now is in a bit of a sole-sourced position. If you step back and think about what sequestration could do to that, the 60% that are sole-sourced, that number could go up.  And so at the end of the day we step back and we look at all of those things and the one thing we know for certain, is that if sequestration happens, the cost of the programs that we are providing to the Navy and the Coast Guard will go up. Not necessarily the cost of the programs that we're executing today but the cost of the future programs that will go up.  You want to go buy another aircraft carrier? You want to compare it to a cost of the Ford? My forecast would be that it would be more expensive in the environment that gets created under sequestration. And so from my standpoint it's a terrible way to run the country and I think that it's something that cooler heads are going to have to come together and find a solution to because we're just the shipbuilders.  I am sure that the entire industry is wrestling with this in the same way. We have the advantage of actually being able to step back and say that there's a day after sequestration and there's three to five years of things that we've got to go do to get right to meet our financial plans and we can work on whatever the impact of sequestration is after it's over.  A lot of the folks in our industry do not have that ability and a lot of the folks in our supply chain do not have that ability and so for us, it's important that strategically we get this right.  As far as particular scenarios, because of the cycle time of what we're doing we're not evaluating any particular scenario quite frankly because I think the Pentagon may actually have this right. As soon as you start to evaluate any scenario, it becomes the straw man against which all other scenarios get measured and I don't know that anybody particularly wants to be the straw man right now.  So that's about as candid as I can be about it. We are watching it. We are engaged. We are talking about the impacts, the challenges in our industrial base, in our shipbuilding industrial base. We're working it very hard but we are focused on retiring the risk in our business, driving this business to where it needs to be over the next three to five years and we have the tools in our hands today to do that. 
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Thanks very much. I know it's a tough topic to address, but I appreciate the color. 
Mike Petters: And it's a little long-winded too I know. 
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: That's okay. It's a tough topic. 
Mike Petters: Well, thanks for the question. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed. 
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein:  Good morning. If you look at the margins at Ingalls, and they were improving. But could you talk a little bit what operational metrics you're looking at in the Gulf right now and how we should think of this margin improvement as sitting on some kind of interjectory toward the goals that you've described. 
Mike Petters: Well, first of all, I think the way to think about what's happening in the Gulf I'll go back to what we just talked about. We've done a lot of work over the last four years to put ourselves in position to retire substantial amount of risk. And the work that we're going to do in the next few months is going to be the culmination of that.  Going to builders trials on 23 and 24 are significant milestones. Launching LHA-6 is a significant milestone. We just launched LPD-25, another significant milestone. And so over the next four months you're going to see these milestones go by and you'll see us be able to step back with a little bit more certainty about, okay, these things just like with LPD-22 we were able to move past another big piece of the risk.  As we've said all along, the year 2013 is really the inflection point for any sort of trajectory in performance at Ingalls. Our operating system is full of metrics where we do hot washes after every phase and do all kinds of things like that. But it's really going to be the ultimate delivery of LHA-6, the delivery of 23, 24 and 25 and the closure of Avondale - getting those things out of our system and getting them behind us, then puts us in a place to accelerate.  And so as we said earlier today, you should see a little bit of an improvement year-over-year at Ingalls this year. But after that I think that 2013 becomes the inflection. The new work comes in and we accelerate that into our goal of 9%-plus in 2015.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: And then related to that, when you think of LPD-25 over at Avondale and could you describe any progress in the thinking about the ultimate disposition of Avondale and then also how you ensure us that’s the last piece of work that may be done there that you make sure that goes smoothly to the end point and gets delivered with the kind of quality and cost that you're targeting. 
Mike Petters: Sure. It's something we think about every day. The plan of record today still is to close that shipyard. We do not have an alternative plan today. We continue to explore alternatives but our plan is we're marching down the path of closure. 25's launch was a significant milestone because it was a high quality launch. The ship was in great shape when it went into the water.  LPD-23 is in great shape as it gets ready to go on sea trials. The workforce at Avondale has done a magnificent job since the announcement when we were part of North (inaudible) in 2010 that – of the plan to close Avondale. They've done an absolutely tremendous job on these last two ships.  The things that we've done, we've tried to step back and think about the things that you just asked about. What's going to happen when you only have two ships left and you're going to close it, what's the disruption – what's the potential for that to be? How do you manage your cost? How do you make it as variable as you can? We've thought our way all the way through that.  We put some incentives for instance for attendance and productivity in our labor contract and our union leadership worked with us to do that in a very constructive way. And all of those incentives have been met to-date. We have another year to go on that and we continue to be optimistic about how that's going to turn out.  But we're, as we've said all along, this is a bit uncharted territory. And so we go into this with our eyes wide open. 
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please proceed. 
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research:  Yes. Good morning. Could you tell us what percent of Ingalls business is currently making a 9% margin?
Mike Petters: You know, George, we don't break it out that way in any of our reporting. As we've said before about 25% of our total revenue last year was in these heritage programs. The delivery of LPD-22 reduces that this year. And that's about as far as we've gone with it. 
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Okay. And then also, Barb, kind of my question I always ask. The contract for losses came down $7 million in the quarter, clearly better than the fourth quarter because you didn't have LPD-22. Is that still sufficient you think to not require an incremental charge?
Barb Niland: Well, George, we talked about this as we go through 24 and 23 and Mike just talked about 25. We feel pretty good about those ships but we still don't know. So there could be some incremental small charges as we go forward. But nothing that we anticipate or know right now.  What I will tell you in terms of provisions in the fourth quarter we were 89% complete on LPD-23 and 24. And we're just about at 94% complete on those two ships right now or through the March 31, so through the reporting period. And so I believe those provisions are adequate right now. 
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spinharn of Credit Suisse. Please proceed. 
Robert Spinharn - Credit Suisse:  Good morning, everyone. Mike, I'm trying to reconcile on this Ingalls profitability issue some of the things that you've said. And it sounds like it's not just a question of delivering legacy ships and adding new ships but you also have these initiatives across the yard that are intended to improve profitability toward that 9%. And then listening to your answer to George's question it would seem to imply that really perhaps no ships in that yard are yet at 9%. So, one, is that an unfair assumption. I know I'm asking his question again but I think it's an important question. And then two, in this environment can you really expect to earn 9%-type margins on future contracts given what the Pentagon's doing on pricing?
Mike Petters: Well, as I said before we're not going to break that out any more than we already have. One of the things that you have to remember about what we do is that when we have brand new contract we are fairly conservative in the way that we book it. When these heritage contracts are gone we're going to have a handful of new contracts that we're working our way through.  And so that's why you see the ramp up after 2013 because the burden of profitability is going to fall on a handful of relatively new contracts. As far as the Navy pricing goes, my sense of this is that at the end of the day it's up to us to go and make sure that we get a solid contract that allows us to attract capital and talent to our business.  And so it is a challenge. We've talked about this several times. When we go into a contract negotiation it's often less about what the price of the contract is. It's often more about what's in the risk and how are you going to share the risk and what's in the scope.  We've had contract negotiations where the whole negotiation has been about scope. And so I expect that we'll be continuing to have those. It's certainly – I think everybody who's ever been in this business for the last 200 years would say that those are always challenging and they will continue to be challenging. It's our job to get that right and that's what we intend to do. 
Robert Spinharn - Credit Suisse: But, Mike, if you're talking – if you're focusing on scope in those discussions then where do you get the comfort that you can hit 9% on the future contracts and frankly on the other ships that are in the yard now without really being there yet? Except perhaps at Newport News, which doesn’t seem to me to be necessarily relevant at Ingalls. 
Mike Petters: Well, first of all, we have contract structures that allow us to get there. Secondly, those are based on a very solid understanding of what the risk registers look like. Third, we have a leadership team that's focused on the retirement of those risks. We, Barb and I, have spent four years now building this team with Matt Mulherin at Newport News and Irwin Edenzon at Ingalls, have been building this team to make sure that we are focused on what we need to do to perform.  I'm very proud of what those guys are doing today and I'm very confident that as we go into this uncertain future this is the team that I want to go into that future with. And I'm very comfortable with our prospect and our outlook for 9%-plus in 2015. 
Robert Spinharn - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks very much. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi of UBS. Please proceed. 
Darryl Genovesi - UBS:  Morning. So, I guess, just sticking with Ingalls for a second but on the top line specifically can you just give us a sense of how close you are to a steady state revenue run rate at this point on your new ships, so DDG-113, LPD-26 and NSC-4? Are those fully ramped up or is there still upside on the top line there?
Mike Petters: I think what you're going to see is a bit of a blend. We're still ramping up on the new ships and we're going to be coming down on the heritage ships.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS: No. It's understood on the heritage ships. But I mean if you could just address those three new ships individually. I think that would be helpful. 
Mike Petters: I mean, we've just started them. So. 
Barb Niland: It's timing of how material comes into the yard. It'll be timing top line for Ingalls. It'll be timing on LPD-27 and LHA-7 contracts. So – but right now DDG-113 and 114, NSC-4 and 5 and LPD-27 are on schedule and performing well. 
Darryl Genovesi - UBS: Okay. And then just in terms of, I guess building off Carter's question a little bit. As you guys are looking now to negotiate long-term contracts with the Navy on Virginia-class submarine and on your DDG program, what can you do to protect yourselves on those programs given that we still don't really have any clarity on the 2013 budget or on what's going to happen with the sequester and I'd imagine that we may see a few more rounds of this budget cutting here in the few years. So just wondering what are you doing in terms of building in penalty clauses in case things end up getting cancelled down the road, et cetera?
Mike Petters: Well, first of all, every single negotiation has its own personality if you will. And so there's no silver bullet that fixes this in every single negotiation. Each one takes on a life of its own and the team that works it comes up with a range of solutions.  Clearly one of the issues that we have to deal with when we are negotiating a contract today is what our future business base might be. And so that becomes an item in our risk register and it's something that we have to appropriately work through with the Navy about how much of that risk do they want to share. And the more that they want to share the more we can put it into the terms and conditions of the contract.  If they want to share less of that, then that affects the price that they have to pay. And so that’s kind of the general way we think about that. Whether it's our future business base or any of those other things that could happen to us, we put all of those on the risk register and then we have a discussion with the Navy about what's the appropriate way to share that risk.  And the more risk they put to us, the more it affects our price. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed. 
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo:  Good morning. Can you just talk a little bit about the milestones you've mentioned several times at Ingalls in terms of what are the major milestones we should be looking for over the summer? And then just help me understand how we should see that play out in the P&L in the sense that if there are no issues, do we see a reserve that likely gets released? Or is it more a matter if there's an issue we might see further charges?
Mike Petters: Yes. I think it's more the latter than the former. But I would say that again the milestones to look for are on the heels of the launch of 25, which we just came through. We have coming up sea trials on the 23. Launch of America. And sea trials on the 24. All of those are major milestones for us. They are the times where we can step back with quality launches and quality trials, we can step back with a sense that we've retired some risk associated with these programs. And that's kind of the way we're managing it. And that’s why we keep bringing people back to these milestones. To get through to those milestones in whatever fashion that we do, as clean as we can, then continues to confirm and validate our overall long-term outlook. 
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: Okay. And if I can just follow-up on the Virginia-class, just as you’ve ramped up the two boats, I'm surprised to see revenues down year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about that and maybe size the performance improvements that we would have seen in the quarter on that program?
Barb Niland: Okay. Let's start with the performance improvements. There wasn't anything significantly material on there. But as far as the revenue, it only dropped a little bit and that was really related to we had a huge fourth quarter of material come in. So a big ramp up on material on Block 3 in the fourth quarter that we didn't have in the first quarter. So that was what's driving it. 
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ruttenbur of CRT Capital. Please proceed.
Brian Ruttenbur - CRT Capital:  Thank you very much. Hi, Mike and Barb. What kind of build delays do you guys see versus pure dollar delays in the near-term and long-term?
Barb Niland: I don't really see any. Right now we're funded. We don't have any issues in terms of funding so I don' really see any issues.
Mike Petters: And we don't have issues with invoicing and payments on contracts that we have. If your question is really are we concerned about delays in appropriations and procurements going forward, I think that’s in the cloud of what ultimately happens with sequestration.  You're starting to hear people talking a little bit about unobligated dollars in prior years and what does that mean? Most of our dollars are obligated and so it's not clear that that’s a big issue for us but it certainly is a big issue for the industry.  One of the biggest confusions around sequestration I think today is that nobody really knows how it's going to be implemented. Even if you just said, okay, this is what the law says and let's go implement the law. Is it going to be a 10% across the whole business of everything that we do? And I think one of the Senators pointed out that how do you do that and buy three-quarters of a submarine. That becomes a real problem.  And so then there's a question of can you take sequestration and do vertical cuts to get to the numbers and I don't know that anybody knows. I know there's a lot of opinions but I don't know that anybody knows and we certainly aren't qualified to even have an opinion on that.  So that just continues to add to the uncertainty of our 5 to 10-year outlook. 
Brian Ruttenbur - CRT Capital: Okay. As a follow-up let me see if I can be a little clearer on my question. Skepticism exists out there in terms of you guys being able to expand margins in a real questionable environment. I'm not a skeptic because it's basically you're still coming up to what would be less than what your biggest peers are in terms of margins. Can you address that? Where your peers are and why you don't think that you can get up to as high as the peer? Or do you think you can as high as your peers are and that wouldn't mean much higher than 9%?
Mike Petters: Well, I think in the shipbuilding business the history has been in the 9% to 10% range. And we believe that we can operate sustainably in that range. But we're coming through a period of time here where we've got to retire substantial risk to get to that.  We have the workload in our backlog today to do that and so the thought that somehow the budget debate is effecting our ability to improve our margins is a bit specious as far as I'm concerned. I think that we are focused internally to continue to drive the margins up to that normal operating range for the history of shipbuilding.  What happens in shipbuilding is that mature programs book more than 10% because they're successful and you're in serial production and you're doing really well. Brand new programs book less than that. And so it's the blend that you're looking for in the business. The healthy business has a handful of new programs and has a handful of mature programs and you blend that together to get to the overall long-term sustainable run rate.  And so I see no reason why this business can not be operating as well as anybody in the industry. 
Brian Ruttenbur - CRT Capital: Thank you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Yes, couple of other questions. Can you disclose what the EACs were in the quarter because I assume you'll probably put it out in the Q anyway?
Barb Niland: Are you just asking for the cumulative adjustments, George?
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: I think that's all you're going to disclose in the Q, right?
Barb Niland: Right. So Q1 2012 our cumulative adjustments were $14 million favorable versus Q1 last year of $4 million unfavorable adjustments. And so if you recall Q1 last year we recorded the negative adjustment for the retention grants issued as part of the spend and the continued risk evaluation on the 78 contract plus LPD-22 and 24.  So this quarter we had, like I said, the $14 million cumulative favorable adjustment but basically it was across multiple programs, those milestones were achieved. Ship board test program on the RCOH. We finished the PSA on one of the submarines. So it was really across the board and there was no single item that was material. 
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Okay. And then just another quick one. The $240 million jump in receivables in the quarter that usually happens in the first quarter. It happened last year. Is there anything unusual in that? Can you detail what specific programs it might have been on?
Barb Niland: That was across the board. It was really accruals driving that. That's – like you said, it happens every year. 
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Okay. Thanks very much again. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citigroup. Please proceed. 
Jason Gursky - Citigroup:  Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Barb, just a couple of quick technical questions for you. Can you update us on what your expectation is for both pension expense for the entire year as well as CapEx?
Barb Niland: Okay. So let's start with CapEx. CapEx I expect to be in the 2% to 3% range like I've said. First quarter if you took out the $36 million we paid last year first quarter for the closure of Avondale with Louisiana, we're about the same quarter-over-quarter. So $27 million. And I expect the year to be just a little bit less than last year but in that 2% to 3%, kind of in the high end of the 2% to 3% range like I've said before. So that’s the CapEx.  On the pension basically we expect the net FAS/CAS adjustment to be in the $77 million range. If you go back to what we talked about in March, we put together a pension assumptions chart and none of those assumptions have changed. 
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: Okay. That's great. I just wanted to make sure that was any changes there. And then, Mike, could you just discuss a little bit about labor down in the Gulf and how labor retention is going down there and how the labor force down there is progressing along the various learning curves? Just another way of trying to explore some of the potential risks at Ingalls and the margin ramp down there.
Mike Petters: You bet. One of the things that we set out to do when we first started bringing all this together about four years ago was that we had to build a constructive relationship with our various labor unions and we've done that. Just several months ago we signed an extension to the labor agreement down there that’s going to carry us out for the next couple of years.  And it was approved pretty solidly by the workforce. There's a belief in the workforce that we have the right approach to improving the business. Our people want to be part of something that is successful and they see that we're on a path to be successful.  What we've seen in particular, I've already spoken a little bit about the folks at Avondale, they really have taken on the challenge if these are the last two ships we're going to build. They're going to be the best two ships we ever build and we've very, very proud of that.  And they have every right to be very proud of that. And so I think that's a testament to Erwin and his team in the way that they partner constructively with the organizations that handle our production. And we consider that an asset. And we continue to look forward to working with them in the future. 
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: Okay. Great. Thank you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. 
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank:  Thanks. Good morning. Maybe, Barb, first. On the first quarter of last year negative adjustments effecting Ingalls margins, can you quantify what that was so we can get a clean compare in terms of what the margin was year-on-year?
Barb Niland: Well, Myles, they weren't material so they weren’t significant. And there was small adjustments on LPD-22 and 24. So we haven't been giving amounts out. 
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: If you excluded those from both periods would you have had margin expansion?
Barb Niland: Well, we have margin expansion because we delivered LPD-22. So you're going from the 2.2% to the 2.9%. 
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Right. So the 2.2% though had a negative adjustment in it?
Barb Niland: It did. Small. 
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: If you add it – okay. So even if you added it back you would still show margin expansion?
Barb Niland: Right. 
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Good. And then, Mike, on the 9% by 2015. Obviously a piece of it is a mix shift of the backlog and a piece of it's the productivity improvement. As you look at a glide [ph] slope, it sounds like 2012 was a slight improvement, 2013 has the benefits of the mix shift. Is the glide slope from 2013 to 2015 relatively linear at that point?
Mike Petters: I think, I'm not exactly know what relatively linear actually means, but what I would say is it will be accelerating. 2013 will have deliveries and the closure of Avondale all in there so 2013 is going to be a bit of a mix. 2014 will be clean and then as we retire risk on new programs, 2015 will be where we need to be.  And so I'd hesitate to say that it's a stair-step linear thing from 2013 to 2015. I'd hesitate to say that because we're going to be working through the start-up of the new programs and the retirement of the risk on the front end of those programs. And that's what we'll really be doing in 2014.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: But I guess if I understand it right that the move from 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015 is really about your ability to drive the productivity improvements through the base business as opposed to any type of mix shift or program-X specific issues being delivered…
Mike Petters: It'll be new contracts that'll have opportunity in it. It'll have risk in it. And as we retire the risk we step up. So that's what we'll be doing. 
Barb Niland: And I would say, on the productivity improvement, we're seeing productivity improvement today and so when we bid those new contracts we bid those contracts based on how we're performing today. So there isn't this whole leap we have to take to achieve those targets. 
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Okay. That’s fair. Just wanted to understand the slope. Thanks. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Matt Vittorioso of Barclays Capital. Please proceed. 
Matt Vittorioso - Barclays Capital:  Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just a quick question on working capital here. Obviously a pretty significant use of cash for working capital in the first quarter. Can we expect similar to what we saw last year and online throughout the year with the bulk of that coming in the fourth quarter? Or can you just give us a little guidance on what we should be looking for there?
Barb Niland: No. That's exactly what I'm looking for. I expect it to look very similar to last year and then December will be the month that will tell where we end up for the year just like last year. I reminded everybody in the last call that in the last week of the month we had collected the majority of that cash. So I'm banking on the same thing to happen this year. 
Matt Vittorioso - Barclays Capital: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up. Can you just give us a sense of how you intend to manage the cash balance going forward, right? That puts you back towards $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Would you guys look into potentially paying down some term loan or is there other things out there – acquisitions or other opportunities that you're looking at that you'd want to keep the cash on the balance sheet for?
Mike Petters: Certainly we're considering all of the potential uses of cash today. But our number one priority is to make sure that we get through the risk retirement of the four ships that are remaining and the closure of Avondale. So all of the other things we are considering. The things that you can do with cash, we're working very hard on what's the right use of that cash today.  But the first thing that we have to do is we have to get through the closure of Avondale. 
Matt Vittorioso - Barclays Capital: Okay. Great. Thanks. That's helpful.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi of UBS. Please proceed.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS: Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to get an update on the – you guys have this estimate of $271 million out there that you thought it was going to take to close Avondale, of which I think $128 million was an asset write-down and the remaining $143 million was cash. So just wondering if there's been any change to that and if any of that cash has actually gone out the door yet?
Barb Niland: Yes. Like Mike talked about, one of the reasons why we feel like our estimates on 23 and 25 should be in the range of reasonable amounts is we're paying incentives and we're also paying retentions to our employees. So we've spent about $74 million to-date of the – my recollection is it's $150 million of facility expenses and human capital expenses. And so we've spent $74 million so about half of that to-date.  And part of that was also the payment we made to Louisiana for the cooperative endeavor agreement. 
Darryl Genovesi - UBS: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of (inaudible) of JPMorgan. Please proceed. 
Unidentified Participant:  Thank you. Good morning. As I look out in several years and the margins improve and so forth, how does credit ratings fit into the picture? And any thoughts around financial policy and perhaps working towards investment grade in the out years?
Mike Petters: Again, all of that’s part of our thinking today is just what do we want to look like when Avondale closes. And what's the right way for us to be deploying the cash that we will be able to generate. If we're able to and we're very confident that we'll be able to achieve our 2015 objective. How do we redeploy that cash to create the most value for the business. And we're taking a hard look at that.  But at this point all we're prepared to say is we've got to get through Avondale first. 
Unidentified Participant: Yes, granted there is the Avondale work that is still in front of you, but does investment grade ratings make sense to the company. Is that something you would like or are you comfortable in the BB ratings category?
Mike Petters: Again, I think we're considering all of the possibilities at this point. We're not uncomfortable where we are. But we also recognize that there are values to be somewhere else and we're looking at all of that. But we're not prepared today to cite that we have any particular objective. 
Unidentified Participant: Thank you. That's all I had. 
Operator:  Thank you, sir. At this time we have no questions. I would now like to turn this call over to Mr. Mike Petters for closing remarks. 
Mike Petters: Well, thank you and thanks to all of you for being part of the call today. As we said at the beginning, this call is six weeks since our last call and so not much has changed since then. But it's good to have another quarter under our belt. Another quarter where we've retired some of that heritage risk that's out there. The next few months are going to be very important for us in that regard with the potential sea trials that we have coming up and the launch of America.  And we're excited about that. We think about that in terms of we've in a football analogy, we've driven this all the way down into the opportunity to score. Now we've got to get the ball across the goal line and that's where we are on all those programs and so we've done a lot of hard work to get here. But we're not done yet and we're very focused on that.  So thank you all for being part of this and we'll talk to you next quarter. 
Operator:  Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings conference call. My name is Keisha and I’ll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. If at any time during the call you require assistance, please press star, zero and an operator will be happy to assist you. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Andy Green, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Andy Green: Thanks Keisha. Good morning and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2011 Earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barb Niland, Corporate Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer.  As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in their remarks today, Mike and Barb will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including free cash flow, segment operating income, adjusted segment operating income, adjusted segment operating margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted diluted EPS in the fourth quarter and full-year 2011. Full-year 2011 adjusted figures exclude the $290 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Fourth quarter 2011 adjusted figures exclude a $10 million reversal of a portion of the impairment charge taken in the third quarter 2011. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation that is posted on our website.  We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release.  With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Petters: Thanks, Andy. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on today’s call. I am pleased to report Huntington Ingalls Industries’ results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2011. Today we reported fourth quarter sales of $1.74 billion, flat over the same period last year, and full-year sales of $6.6 billion, down about 2% from last year. If you recall, in the third quarter we booked an estimated $300 million goodwill impairment charge that was driven by adverse equity market conditions. After completing the appropriate goodwill impairment test, the final impairment charge was $290 million. Because of the change in the goodwill impairment, reported fourth quarter EPS was $1.39 and reported full-year EPS was a loss of $1.93. Barb will have more detail on the goodwill impairment during her remarks. Now excluding the impact of the impairment, fourth quarter total operating margin was 6.6%, up from 6.0% last year, and diluted earnings per share was $1.19 for the quarter, down from $1.29 in 2010. For the full year, again excluding the impact of the impairment, operating margin was 6.1% compared with 3.7% last year, and diluted earnings per share was $3.97 for the year, up from $2.77 in 2010. Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $16.3 billion compared with $17.3 billion last year.  Free cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year came in very strong. During the fourth quarter, we generated just under $400 million in free cash flow and we ended the year with $915 million of cash.  Now I’d like to walk through some of the highlights of our individual ship programs, starting with Ingalls. For the DDG 51’s, we began fabrication work on DDG 113 and will soon begin construction of DDG 114, the second ship in the DDG 51 restart. We expect the next block buy of DDG 51’s later this year, a contract that could be for as many as nine ships split between us and General Dynamics. We are aggressively preparing for the next round of awards and are confident that we will be competitive. On the LPD program, we delivered LPD 22 San Diego in December and our customer, the U.S. Navy, said this ship was the best LPD delivered to date. We expect LPD’s 23 and 24 to go to sea trials later this summer and delivery of the two ships by the end of the year. LPD 25 is progressing well and should launch later this year, although significant risk remains since it is the last ship to be completed at Avondale. We’ve also begun construction of LDP 26 and we are working under a long-lead material contract for LPD 27, and expect to finalize a construction contract for LPD 27 in the near future. In the LHA program, we expect to launch LHA 6 America this summer, a critical point in the construction program as all subsequent work is performed in the water. We are in the process of negotiating a contract for LHA 7, which is the next America-class amphibious assault ship, and expect to have a contract in place soon.  For national security cutters, we’ve begun construction of NSC 4 and will soon begin construction of NSC 5. We expect a long-lead material contract for NSC 6 later this year and a construction contract in 2013. For the DDG 1000 program, we are manufacturing the deckhouses, hangars and vertical launch system components for DDG’s 1000 and 1001 and expect a contract award for similar work on DDG 1002 later this year.  At Avondale, we are maintaining our plan of record to wind down our operations; however, we remain committed to examining other opportunities to redeploy the shipyard and it’s talented workers in other ways, including the possibility of a joint venture with a credible partner.  Now turning to Newport News – in aircraft carrier construction, Ford is over 74% structurally erected. The program remains on track and the ship is on schedule for launch in 2013 with expected delivery in 2015. On Kennedy, structural manufacturing, material procurement, and design and planning continue under the construction preparation contract. We expect to have a construction contract in place sometime in 2013. The refueling and complex overhaul for Roosevelt is progressing very well and she is on schedule for redelivery in mid-2013. We are also preparing for the refueling of Lincoln, which comes into the shipyard in early 2013. For carrier inactivations, we are preparing for Enterprise to enter the yard in mid-2013 for defueling of its eight nuclear reactors. Enterprise just recently left Norfolk for a final overseas deployment, and following this deployment she will begin the inactivation process.  On the Virginia-class submarine program, the two submarine per year build plan is going well and we expect to launch Minnesota, the last Block 2 submarine, later this year with expected delivery in 2013. On Block 4, we expect a contract award in 2013 for at least nine boats to be built between 2014 and 2018.  Outside of the submarine and carrier businesses, Newport News began execution of the contract to manage maintenance for the Navy’s reactor prototype facility in Kesselring, New York. This is an important win for us as it enables us to leverage our significant strengths in nuclear engineering to pursue other opportunities in reactor maintenance. Finally, our Newport News industrial subsidiary was awarded a contract to manufacture shield building wall modules for four AP1000 nuclear reactors being constructed in Georgia and South Carolina. This contract represents a significant achievement for us as we expand into commercial nuclear energy. Overall, our programs are progressing well. We are working through our underperforming contracts in Ingalls and we have a strong pipeline of new business. We were pleased to see that the President’s budget request submitted to Congress in mid-February demonstrated support for the Navy and for shipbuilding. Now although the budget process has only just begun and many things can change before it becomes law, we believe our programs are well-represented. Under the request, funding for our major programs remains intact, including the construction of CVN 79 and the refueling of CVN 72 beginning in 2013 as planned. Funding continues for DDG 51’s and submarines, although one Virginia-class submarine slips from fiscal year ’14 to FY18 under the plan. There were no amphibious ships in the request, but this was expected given both LHA 7 and LPD 27 were funded just last year. One thing we are sure of is that the best way we can shape our future is by providing the most capable and most affordable ships to our customers. I can assure you that we are and will remain intensely focused on achieving this goal.  Now turning to cash deployment, since the spend we’ve been very transparent about the risks in the business, including the completion of the legacy LPD and LHA contracts and the wind-down of the Avondale shipyard. Although we’ve quantified our best estimates to complete these projects, it’s important to remember that risk remains until these items are behind us. For that reason, we’ve taken a conservative approach to cash management and will continue to do so for the near future until we get more clarity on these major challenges. That being said, we are continually evaluating alternatives and we are committed to deploying cash in a manner that creates the most value for our shareholders. Now looking ahead, I’ll make a couple of comments on the outlook for 2012 as it relates to operating margin. As I’ve said before, the real inflection point in our margin expansion story is in 2013, after we’ve delivered LPD 25 and LHA 6. Then, we expect margin expansion should continue on its way to our goal of 9%-plus total Company operating margin in 2015. Between now and then, we expect continued margin expansion at Ingalls which, combined with the stability of Newport News, should drive modest improvement in overall segment operating margin. Barb will have some more detail in her remarks on items below the segment operating income level. So in summary, we closed out 2011 with a strong fourth quarter and we are carrying that momentum into 2012. In the fourth quarter, we posted year-over-year improvement in operating earnings and operating margin, both at Ingalls and at the company level, reflecting our continued focus on improving productivity and profitability. We delivered LPD 22, the first of the five underperforming ships that we expect to deliver between now and 2013; and looking ahead, we remain firmly on track to achieve our long-term revenue and margin targets that we’ve laid out over the past year. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barb Niland: Thank Mike and good morning to everyone on the call. I would like to briefly review our consolidated and segment results as disclosed in the press release and wrap up with some comments on pension and cash.  Before I get into our operational results, I’d like to discuss the goodwill impairment charge we took during 2011. As you are aware, with the decline in our stock price and market capitalization that began in the second quarter, we performed an impairment analysis that resulted in a $300 million preliminary goodwill charge in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we finalized the calculations, which decreased the charge by 10 million for a 2011 total non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $290 million.  Now turning to the financials on Slide 4 of the presentation, reported fourth quarter sales were essentially flat and 2011 sales decreased 148 million from the comparable period in 2010. These changes were mainly driven by lower volumes following the delivery of DDG 110, lower volume on the LPD 22 through 25 contract, the Roosevelt RCOH, the Enterprise EDSRA, and the PSA for Bush. These were partially offset by higher volume on DDG 113, LHA 6, the national security cutter program, long-lead procurement for LPD 27, construction on the Ford, construction preparation on the Kennedy, advanced planning on the Lincoln RCOH, and the VCS program increasing production to two submarines per year. As a result of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge and subsequent partial reversal, GAAP reported segment operating income for the quarter was 127 million and 122 million for the full-year. The total operating income for the quarter was 124 million and 110 million for the full-year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.39 for the quarter and negative for the full-year. Adjusted for the goodwill impairment, fourth quarter segment operating income was 117 million and total operating income was 114 million. Total operating margin was 6.6% compared to 6% for the same period last year. For 2011, adjusted segment operating income was 412 million and adjusted total operating income was 400 million. Adjusted total operating margin was 6.1% compared to 3.7% in 2010. Adjusted for the goodwill charge, diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.19 compared to $1.29 for the fourth quarter 2010, and $3.97 for the year compared to $2.77 for the prior year.  Cash from operating activities for the fourth quarter was 474 million, up 266 million or 128% over the same period last year. Cash from operating activities for the year was 523 million, up 169 million or 47% over 2010. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were 78 million, down from 95 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, capital expenditures were 197 million or 3% of sales. CAPEX generally falls between 2 and 3% of sales annually and we expect CAPEX for 2012 to continue at the high end of this range. Beyond 2012, CAPEX should begin declining toward the lower end of that range. Turning to Slide 5, Ingalls revenues for the fourth quarter of 2011 decreased 51 million or 7% from the same period last year. 2011 sales decreased 142 million or 4.7% from 2010. Lower sales were primarily driven by lower volume following the delivery of DDG 110 and lower volume on the LPD 22 through 25 contract, partially offset by higher volume on DDG 113, LHA 6, NSC and long-lead procurement for LPD 27. Excluding the 10 million reversal of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, Ingalls operating income for the quarter was 15 million compared with 10 million in the same period in 2010. Ingalls adjusted operating income for 2011 was 70 million, up significantly over the operating loss in 2010. Ingalls adjusted operating margin was 2.2% for the quarter, up from 1.4% last year, driven by LPD 22 through 25 program performance and the effects of the new contracts. Turning to Slide 6, Newport News revenue for the quarter increased 51 million or 5% from fourth quarter 2010 primarily driven by higher volume on the Ford, the construction preparation contract for Kennedy, advanced planning efforts on the Lincoln RCOH and the VCS program partially offset by lower volume on the Roosevelt RCOH, the Enterprise EDSRA, and the PSA for Bush. 2011 sales decreased 9 million or 0.2% primarily driven by the decrease in aircraft carrier sales volume, which I discussed, and lower fleet support sales volume. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume on the VCS program from increasing production to two submarines per year.  Newport News operating income for the quarter was 102 million compared with 106 million in the fourth quarter last year. Segment operating income for 2011 was 342 million, down 13 million from 2010. This decrease was primarily due to contract mix and risk retirement that occurred in 2010 on Vinson and Bush, partially offset by risk retirement on the VCS program in 2011. Newport News operating margin was 9.5% for the quarter compared to 10.3% in the fourth quarter of 2010, and was 9.1% for 2011 versus 9.4% last year. If you’ll turn to Slide 7, I’d like to make a few comments on pensions. We are expecting 2012 net FAS/CAS adjustments of negative $77 million based on a reduction in the discount rate from 5.84% to 5.23% and a reduction in our expected long-term return on assets from 8.5% to 8%. 2012 cash contributions to pension and post-retirement benefit plans are expected to be 111 million net of cash recovery.  Regarding some of the other income statement items in 2012, deferred state taxes should run about negative 16 million, interest expense should be roughly 118 million, and our tax rate should be close to 35%. Dilution in 2012 is expected to be approximately 600,000 shares, similar to 2011.  As Mike highlighted earlier, we ended the year with 915 million in cash due to multiple large invoices paid at the end of the year. We are typically a cash user in the first quarter of the year and then this reverses over the remaining three quarters. We saw this in 2011 and are seeing a similar trend in 2012. Also in the first quarter, we have already contributed $123 million to the pension plan or about half of our expected total 2012 obligation. As a result, we expect first quarter cash balance to be between 500 and 600 million. That wraps up my remarks, and with that I’ll turn the call over to Andy for Q&A.
Andy Green: Thanks Barb. Before we start Q&A, just as a reminder, we’d like everyone to limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up so we can get as many in the queue as possible. Keisha, can you start the Q&A?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star, one. If your question has been answered or you wish to withdraw from the queue, simply press star, two. Questions will be taken in the order received. Please press star, one to begin. Your first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citigroup. Please proceed.
Jason Gursky – Citigroup: Good morning everyone. Two quick questions – first on the DDG 51. Mike, you mentioned that there would be as many as nine ships in this next buy, and that it would be split. Can you talk a little bit about your confidence level on that split, and any risk that all nine ships could go to one shipyard? That would be the first question, and then the second one is just on the carrier build and the delivery of the next ships and the impacts that it might have in being pushed out maybe a year or two here on your revenue stream and your statement of kind of flattish revenues as we get out to 2015.
Mike Petters: Okay. First of all on the DDG’s, this approach that the Navy has taken over not just the current time period but really goes back over 20 years on the DDG program, keeping two competitors viable and in a place to strongly compete has created really a model shipbuilding program in terms of the best destroyers on the planet with lots of technology insertion at a very competitive and affordable program. And my view is that the Navy views the fact that they have competition on this program as one of the key attributes for the program, and so I think that the odds that all nine ships could be awarded to one competitor are almost non-existent. The number of programs where the Navy has competition, especially in the high end of Navy warships, is very small, and this is one of them; and the Navy will work to continue to protect that. From our standpoint, as you recall, there was a competition last fall for DDG 116 and while we did not win that competition, it was our first competition in this entire business certainly since Katrina and probably going back about 10 years. We’ve been doing a lot of things. We needed to get out in the field and compete. We learned a lot from that competition, and while we did not win, we are definitely better for having competed and we look forward to the next round. We’re taking steps today to make sure that we’re as competitive as we can be on the next round. Relative to the CVN 79, the challenge to your question about what happens if 79 moves out on our revenue streams and things like that is, well, it depends. It depends on how do you bridge from the work that we’re doing today on 79 to the point where you actually go to a full detail design and construction contract – how long is that time period? How do you bridge that work? How would the Navy want to bridge that work? So we kind of take that one chunk at a time. Our sense of it is right now that our plan and the Navy’s plan and the Administration’s plan is to go to contract next year, and so we’re working very hard to be ready to go and sit down with the Navy and get that done.  If all of that were to change and move out, then we’d have to assess what the bridges would look like to get from Point A to Point B. If you decided that you were going to absolutely stop all work and not bridge from where we are today to the point of signing the contract to build the ship, the cost of the ship would go up so much that it would probably not be—it wouldn’t make any sense to do that. So I can’t give you a whole lot more clarity on that except to say it really depends on what the bridge looks like, and our focus is not so much on the bridging from here to there but really in making sure that we’re ready to go to contract next year and avoid that whole problem.
Jason Gursky – Citigroup: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Good morning. On something you said earlier, Mike, when you were talking about the DDG 51’s and you alluded to the competition on 116, if I understand the way the Navy worked that competition, it was really 114 through 116 with the low bidder winning two of the ships – GD got the first two, or you got 114, they got 115 and ’16. But if I understand what Secretary Mabus has said, is they were the low bidder and the high bidder would get the low bidder’s price. So how do we think about your improvement in profitability given that dynamic?
Mike Petters: Well, that’s probably an oversimplification of a pretty complex relationship in this competition. Rob, I’d take you back – remember as a result of the swap, we were going to build the first two DDG’s, and that would be 113 and 114, and Bath was going to build the 115. What the Navy did was they came back and said, hey, why don’t we do a competition for 116 that is a two-ship competition? So you guys bid on 114 and 115, Bath would bid on 115 and 116, and the Navy would get to choose between them. We actually supported that pretty strongly because I really felt the need to get the team out there and compete, and I was glad that we were able to go and compete in this environment before we had to go and try to do a competition for a nine-ship, multi-year kind of program. So that was all valuable for us. The only drawback is we didn’t win it. Now the way the pro competition works is much more complex relative to the way you set the fee, but your general presumption is that the team that gets the—the losing competition does get a lower return on the program than the winning team does, unless the losing team improves its performance. And so our view of it is at this point, we think hard about how we go and get to be competitive. We’re thinking very hard today about what are the steps we need to take or are taking to be competitive on the next competition, and actually how that’s actually driving our performance on the current ships we have under contract. So there’s a reach-back into the work we have under contract, and ultimately all of that doesn’t have—at the end of the day, we don’t think that that changes our long-term outlook of getting the business up above 9% by 2015.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay. You know, I’ll take that the way you’ve said it. I just still have a little bit of trouble reconciling—I think your contract was in the 690’s; the other two contracts were between 660 and somewhere in the 670’s. And again, just to quote the Secretary – he said this recently – the difference in price would come out of the high bidder’s fee. But I think what you’re saying is that that’s partially true?
Mike Petters: Yeah, the Secretary is not wrong; I think it’s a simplification and I think that—but in the end, you’re correct. If we performed at the level that we projected, we would get a lower return than if our competitor performed at the level they projected. But our ambition is that as we move into our next round of competition, we are taking steps to be more competitive, and that creates positive opportunity on the ships we already have under contract.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just on the Avondale closure, you talked about the possibility of a joint venture, and clearly the benefit—the first benefit of doing something like that is jobs get retained, and I’m sure that’s a high priority for everybody. How would the financial exposure change for HII in a joint venture with a going concern, versus full closure as planned? I know it’s complex, but it just goes to the point of whether all of the reimbursable costs are actually really reimbursable – and there’s an open issue there – and then what liabilities might still be there in a joint venture.
Mike Petters: Yeah. What we’ve said, Rob, from the beginning is that in order for us to do anything other than close the shipyard, we need to have four things happen. First of all, we need to have the Navy onboard with regard to the allocation or the way we would handle our restructuring costs in the event that we don’t close it, and so we would need—we’ve had an agreement with the Navy to go and consider these negotiations. If we ended up with some specific thing to consider, we would have another round of discussion with the Navy about how the restructuring would be handled.  The second thing we need is we need state involvement, and you may recall in the fall, the State of Louisiana stepped up to the plate with something like $200 million of incentives for a partner. The third thing we would need is a partner that understands a business that is not Navy business, because the purpose here is to get this footprint out of the Navy production base to lower the Navy’s costs; and then the fourth piece of it is that there has to be a credible and sustainable market out there. Our view of it is if we get a specific opportunity to go and pursue down these paths, we’re going to be talking down all four of these paths again. We’ll have to have a discussion with the Navy about how this specific opportunity would be handled in light of the restructuring; we’d have to talk to the State about how this specific opportunity would be handled in light of the incentives that are out there; we’d have to make sure that we are comfortable that the market that would be pursued would be credible and sustainable, and that the partner has the wherewithal and the credibility to go pursue that market. And so there’s a lot of moving parts in that, so I’m not even sure complex captures the full range of how all that would all work out. A lot of it would be subject to the negotiations around any specific transaction that might be considered.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: So the time frame here—it sounds fairly complex. It would take some time.
Mike Petters: Well you know, the time frame really is—what we’re talking about here is we’re delivering one of the two ships in Avondale this year; we’re delivering the other one next year. And as soon as the second one delivers, our plan would be to proceed to close the shipyard. So from that standpoint, the time frame—the clock is ticking on the sideline here as we’re working our way through this, and we are committed to our Avondale employees to go and turn over every rock to figure this out. We’re doing that, but we’re still on path right now to close it.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Good morning. On CVN 78, Secretary Mabus had a lively exchange with the Senate Armed Services Committee recently. Can you highlight the technical and budget challenges that you’re facing on that program and how you see the margin outlook now, and how that compares with prior plans?
Mike Petters: Well, let me first of all say that we have not change in our outlook on 78 – no change at all. We are proceeding with building the first ship of a new class of aircraft carriers. The ship has basically been completely redesigned from the inside – the hull is the same, but everything else is different. The team is performing at a level better than any I’ve ever seen on any lead ship. Nothing has changed in our outlook, and so from that standpoint, Doug, we’re kind of separating the fact that we are building a lead ship with the best shipbuilders—we’re separating that from the political exchanges going on around the budget about how does the risk of building a lead ship get financed. So we have our contract, we’re working our way through the contract, and we’re proceeding just on the path that we’ve been on.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: So despite all of those discussions that have been in the press, there’s really not a change from your standpoint, is what it sounds like.
Mike Petters: Yeah, I think you have to separate the things that are going on here. We’ve been working this program for a couple years, or several years, and we’re going to be working this program for the next three or four years. We have a contract with the government that shares the risk of this program. We have taken a look from the company standpoint as to what the risks are and we’ve created our plan around that risk set, and we have been on that plan basically since—you remember a year ago, we took back and said, hey, we weren’t quite sure that we had retired the risk in a timely fashion, and so first quarter last year we held back just a little bit. But we basically have been on the financial plan that we had laid from the beginning.  Our friends in the government are working their way through their process in a very public manner on how do they manage the financial risk on their side. In my view, that’s sort of what’s happening here. Let me just tell you, just like we’re working with Avondale where we’re not leaving any stone unturned, we are not leaving any stone unturned on how to drive the costs down on CVN 78. Our contract actually rewards us for driving the cost down, and we have been fairly successful with that. We’ve still got four years to go and we’re going to keep working that very, very hard. It’s clearly to our advantage, but we think that’s in the government’s interest as well. They’ve been very supportive of the things that we need to go do, and they review this with us very, very often. Right now, we’re keeping it on track.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: And then on margins at Ingalls, you talked about the real potential being in 2013 once LPD 25 is delivered. Now, as we look over the course of this year and also think about competing on the next DDG contract, what are the kinds of things that you’re doing at Ingalls today in terms of cost reduction, and are there some expectations we should have with respect to margin, I would say, separate from simply the delivery of—you know, getting the LPD’s behind you?
Mike Petters: Well, first of all I’m not going to go—because of the competitive nature of what we’re trying to do, I’m not going to go into all of the different things that we’re trying to do to drive costs in our competitive business. I think the thing for you to focus on right now, Doug, is that this year we have three major milestones. We have the delivery of two of the LPD’s – one of them is at Avondale, one of them is in Pascagoula – and we have the launch of LHA 6. Those three milestones, they move us—today we sit here with one of the five ships delivered. Those three things happen, we’re going to be on the backside with an eye towards the finish line on getting that risk retired. The delivery of LPD 22 before the end of the year was a major, major accomplishment for the team at Ingalls. It also gave us some perspective on what we need to do to get 23, 24 and 25 delivered. And so as we factor that into what we’re doing, that will clearly factor into 23 and 24’s delivery. Getting those done, getting 6 in the water with a quality launch – those are the things that we’re focused on right now. I don’t want to get too much further out in front of our headlights on that because those are—it’s easy for me to say that, but that’s a lot of hard work by the team down south.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Good morning. Was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cash, and just thinking about cash flow this year, you talked about the pension increase of kind of $111 million. In the past, you’ve talked about Avondale, that this is the peak year in terms of the spending. So I’m just trying to think about the roughly 500 million of cash from operations in 2011 – we know those two headwinds. Is there anything else we should be thinking about, or does it mean we should be on the target of kind of 150, $200 million less in 2012 than 2011?
Barb Niland: Well, I wouldn’t say that your last statement is correct. Let me just give you a little story on the cash flow here. Basically it’s all about timing of cash collections, and in the last two weeks of the year, we collected over $500 million in the last two weeks, and 20% of that came on the last day of the year. So I’ve talked about it in every quarter – it just depends on timing of cash collections, so we’ll be going through the same thing as we go to the end of this year. Then, it depends on the deliveries, so one of the reasons the cash collections were as high as they were in the December was the delivery of LPD 22, and so we got to collect the cash associated with the retention on that ship. So as we go to the delivery of 23 and 24, it will depend on timing of that delivery, timing on the invoices, timing on when the customer chooses to pay those invoices. They will be large invoices, just like LPD 22.  So at the risk of saying that your number is right, I give you caution because the timing of these cash payments will make a significant difference at the end of the year. Like I said, we’re always a cash user. This year is no different – we’re a cash user in the quarter, and basically last year we were negative free cash flow until the second to the last week of the year. So this business, for some reason, seems to operate—my 8.5 years in it, that’s how I’ve seen it operate, and I don’t think it will operate any different this year.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: But in terms of big moving pieces, you’ve talked about some of the operating margins based on some of the other items as being relatively flattish until you get behind some of these big milestones. Is there a way to think about cash flow in any sort of a similar way – and that’s why I know there is a couple big pieces like pension and Avondale spending – but is there anything else big that would move it up or down from where it’s been?
Barb Niland: Like I said, the only things that will move it up is the timing of these payments for the deliveries—so the timing on deliveries and the timing of payments, and the things that will move it significantly down would be if we don’t have the costs right on LPD 23 and 24, and we incur more costs than we anticipate. And then really, it’s all on the timing on the Avondale closure – as we let people go, we’re incurring that cash associated with letting them go. Also, the employee incentives—so it’s all in the timing.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Okay. And then if I can just follow up with one question – Mike, can you just talk about your negotiating LPD, I guess, 27, LHA 7 and DDG 1002. You kind of talked about those coming in this year. Has what’s been going on in terms of Washington with the budget process, the sequestration, has that slowed the process down, or how does that impact the timing?
Mike Petters: Actually I think that the sequestration budget discussion is really for future work – you know, work that hasn’t been appropriated yet. The contracts that we’re working on, these have basically been appropriated and we’re just working our way through the process of getting the scope right and getting the risk register settled so that we can get to a contract. And that’s really—the challenge is that you work your way through this and just make sure that there’s a common view of what’s the scope of work, what’s the risk register look like, how are we going to manage that, and then what’s the price. And I don’t think there’s anything in particular that’s slowing it down, so much as it’s just the next thing we’ve got to go do.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.
Carter Copeland – Barclays: Hi, good morning. This is Meyer (ph) in for Carter. Mike, my starting question is the revenue target that you talked about – you know, keeping it flat through 2015 – I just wanted to be clear. Does that guidance include or exclude the step-down on the Virginia class in ’14?
Mike Petters: Yeah, I think that the reality is that moving that ship out of 2014 into 2015 and pushing everything back will have a minimal effect to our overall view. We would be barely started on that program by 2015.
Carter Copeland – Barclays: Alright. And just to kind of go at Doug’s question another way, you talked about the 2013 inflection point on margins, but if you were to take away the underperforming contracts now, would you say that—I mean, I’m just curious to know what your underlying margins are if you were to just exclude those contracts. It seems you’re already at about 9% at Newport News, but I was just wondering how are you right now at Ingalls, if you can provide any color there?
Mike Petters: All I would say is that we’re on the start of—if you go and you take those contracts that we’re executing and you just take them out of the business, we’re going to replace them with new work. Last year, we said that we needed to go sign five contracts. We’ve actually signed four of the six that have turned up because we got an extra one on the national security cutter in there. We still have the 7 contract and the 27 contract to work our way through. These new contracts will come online. The challenge for us on those is that we’re not going to—because of the way we normalize recognize income on these programs, we don’t go to the final position until we retire all the risk. And so at the very beginning of these programs, the very beginning of 113 and 114, the very beginning of 26, these programs all look good but we’re still on the very—you know, there’s the whole contract to go, and so we’re not ready yet to step up and say that we’re at our full final fee rate on those programs. So it would give you a little bit of a skewed view if you tried to do the analysis the way you’re doing it. Our view is that by 2015 we would have all of that sorted out, the effect of the five ships gone and bringing the new contracts up to the rate that we expect to be normal for the business. We don’t see anything holding us back from that at this point, and we’re on track to it.
Carter Copeland – Barclays: Okay, great. And if I can just sneak in a quick one for Barb – I don’t know if you can provide any color in terms of the sequencing of revenues through the course of the year and if there’s anything you can provide more specifically on Q1 since we’re just a couple days away from finishing that quarter?
Barb Niland: Yeah. You know, I think revenues will flow similar to how they did last year. We’re pretty ratable. The biggest swing happens with material and timing of payables, that type of thing; and then the only other thing that can affect sales up or down would be our progressing. So as we launch these ships, as we launch LHA6, we’ll be looking at progressing pretty hard and that could have a swing on sales, one way or another.
Carter Copeland – Barclays: Great, thank you very much. Oh, sorry – anything on Q1?
Barb Niland: Nothing in particular.
Carter Copeland – Barclays: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research:  Yeah, good morning. Barb, if I take a look at the loss provision number, it declined from 31 to 19, so 12 million this quarter which was improvement because the prior quarter was, like, 19 million. Was there anything in there moving around – reserves – or that was just how it showed? And then since the last LPD doesn’t get delivered until the middle of ’13, so you’ve got five or six quarters and only $19 million to go through without having another charge, what’s the confidence that you’re going to go down to averaging a decline of 3 or 4 million a quarter from what was 12 this quarter?
Barb Niland: Okay. So loss provisions that remain are just for LPD 23 and 24, okay? Prior to that, we had loss provisions in there for also 22 and LHDA. Both those ships are delivered. We feel very confident where we are there. So what you have that $19 million for is LPD 23 and 24 – they’re both around 89, 90% complete, and we plan on delivering them by year-end. We learned a lot with the delivery of LPD 22, so we feel pretty comfortable about where we are on the next two ships, and I feel very comfortable with the provisions that we have.
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research: Okay. And then a follow-up just to get at this margin at Ingalls, maybe, a little differently – if I would kind of roughly estimate that the LHA 6 and the LPD’s are maybe half of the revenues at Ingalls, that would imply that the underlying margin at Ingalls ex-these is more like 4.5%. And then with the risks associated on the DDG and the Ford becoming a bigger percentage of the total, could you provide a little clearer path on how that 4.5%, say, gets to 8.5% by 2015 to get to your overall 9% number?
Barb Niland: Well, basically what we’ve talked about in the past is that when we’re starting new contracts – so on DDG 113, LPD 26 and NSC (inaudible), we have booked to a risk number, so we start out very conservatively. As we progress on those ships and we retire risk and certain events occur – so we’ve bought all the material or we’ve launched the ship – and we are on our cost projections, you’ll see incremental improvement. So as we retire the risk, you will see incremental improvements on those conservative margins which our plan is to be at 9% or better at Ingalls in the future.
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research: And all of that is sufficient to get what looks like, unless my numbers are wrong, about a doubling of the margin even without the current—when the current ships go away?
Mike Petters: You know, what happens—I’m not going to comment on your numbers, George, but what I would say is that when you have a problem like we’ve come through over the last four years, the business gets out of balance. The balanced portfolio of the business, if you were to just take a snapshot, and take a snapshot of Newport News, for instance – you have programs there that are at the very beginning of the program and we’re booking those very conservatively. We also have programs that are at the very end, and we recognize that risk is retired and so we’re able to go and recognize the full opportunity there. Those blended together create a pretty solid level of performance that’s fairly predictable in this business. What we’ve come through on the Gulf Coast is that a substantial fraction of the business basically got knocked off and basically became so underperforming that we couldn’t get the blended rates to be where they need to be, and what we’re going through now between—basically for the last four years that Barb and I have been working this and through the next three years to 2015, is rebalancing that portfolio back to where it needs to be. The first thing we need to do is get those five ships out of the portfolio, then what we have to do is we have to go retire risk on the new programs. So we’re starting these new programs, we’ve signed the contracts in the last year. We’re starting down the path, we’re retiring risk, we’re feeling fairly confident about that; but we have a process that we go through and it just takes some time to work our way through it.
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with Morgan Keegan. Please proceed.
Brian Ruttenbur – Morgan Keegan: Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered. My macro question is on presidential elections. I know that there’s been talk by the Romney camp of potentially increasing shipbuilding. Can you talk about what that would mean potentially for you guys, and if that would accelerate your margin picture in the near term or decelerate it in the near term then accelerate it longer term? Maybe you can just give us some round numbers on that.
Mike Petters: Yeah, what I would say, Brian, is just what we’ve said before – the work that you see and the performance of the business between now and three to five years from now, it’s primarily work we already have under contract. The debate about the budget, the debate about what does the Navy look like, that’s more in the five to 10-year time frame. If you were to go and have some major change and we were going to head to other strategy, some other volume of work, it probably still wouldn’t show up necessarily in our financials in the near term. It takes a while for these things to get to a point where we can recognize them, and so I think that the debate—what’s interesting about the debate is it’s really a debate about what’s the role of the Navy and how does that play into our overall national economic health, which is something that I’ve always thought was the right place for the Navy to be having the debate. So—and I think frankly the fact that the current administration wants to continue on the path with 11 carriers and has supported the Navy so far, it shows me that at the national level, both parties recognize – both possibilities here recognize that the Navy is a key part of our economic future going forward, and that puts Huntington Ingalls in a really good place.
Brian Ruttenbur – Morgan Keegan: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering maybe, Barb, if you can start on the cash flow for pension funding. Moving it up to 250-plus level for 2012, it was relatively de minimis in ’11. I think prior to ’11, it was running around 200 million. Is kind of the longer term, next few years funding requirements or funding expectations in this kind of 200, 250 level?
Barb Niland: Well, I’d need a crystal ball on that one. What we like to do is maintain our funding at 90% on a PPA basis, but like you know, after what happened this year, it depends what the discount rate is going to be, it depends what your long-term return on assets expectations are going to be. So your guess is as good as my guess. I’d like to say it’s predictable, but after what we saw at the end of the year and the changes it’s made in the pension, I would say—you know, saying it looks like this year is fine.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: Okay. The other one, maybe a clarification probably if I missed it, but what was the size of the risk retirement of the Virginia class?
Barb Niland: Well, we don’t really give any full disclosure on individual programs or anything, but we did have a net adjustment for the year of about 54 million positive, and that was primarily due to the Virginia class. This was across all the businesses, the net impact, and a lot of it was attributable to Virginia class.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: So that net 54, is that what the SEC disclosure will be in terms of the net (inaudible) adjustment, or is that in addition to that disclosure?
Barb Niland: No, that will be what the disclosure will be.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And given it was—I imagine it was mostly Block 1 retirement. Is that right?
Barb Niland: Well, it was Block 1, Block 2 and Block 3. As we hit certain material milestones, deliveries, out of warranty periods – it’s across the board – pressure hull complete.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And that opportunity level is remaining in 2012 for that kind of risk retirement?
Barb Niland: It moves around.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: Okay, okay. Great. I think that’s it for me. Thanks. 
Operator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Mike Petters for any closing remarks.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank: Well thank you, and thank you all for your interest in today’s call but also this week marks the one-year anniversary of Huntington Ingalls Industries as a public company. We’ve done a lot of things in the last year for the very first time. We are now moving into kind of the normal order of business where we’re doing things over now, and every time we do things over, we do things better. So we appreciate your interest over the past 12 months and we look forward to continuing to work with you going forward. We’re on our way. We’re very excited about that. We’ve completed a pretty successful first year and we’re on track to achieve the targets that we laid out for you a year ago. Thank you all very much and hope you all have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 Huntington Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name Chenille, and I’ll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today Mr. Andy Green, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Andy Green: Thanks Chenille. Good morning. And welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barb Niland, Corporate Vice President, Business Management and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, statements made in today’s call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law, actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Also in their remarks today, Mike and Barb will refer to certain non-GAAP measures including segment operating income, adjusted segment operating income, adjusted segment operating margins, adjusted total operating income, adjusted total operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS in the third quarter of 2011. All adjusted figures exclude a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Reconciliations of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in a schedule that accompanied our earnings release and is posted on our website. We have posted presentation slides on our website today that we planned to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view the presentation, as well as our earnings release and reconciliations. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Petters: Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today’s call. I’m pleased to report Huntington Ingalls Industries results for the third quarter of 2011. Today we reported sales of $1.59 billion, down 4.3% from the same period last year. A $300 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge which was driven by adverse equity market conditions and not a change in our outlook resulted in a reported net loss of $248 million for the quarter and a loss of $5.07 per share. Barb will have more to say on the charge in her presentation. Excluding the impact of the charge, total operating margin was 6.9%, up from 4.6% last year and diluted earnings per share was $1.05 for the quarter up from $0.86 in 2010. Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $17.3 billion, up about $400 million over the second quarter. Third quarter was a very successful quarter for the company. We booked $2.1 billion of new awards including new construction contracts for DDG-114, the second ship and the DDG-51 restart and NSC-5, the Coast Guards latest National Security Cutter. We also booked several sizable maintenance and repair contracts at AMSEC and Continental Maritime and Newport News Shipbuilding won a large maintenance contract to support the Navy’s Nuclear Propulsion Program in upstate New York. We delivered two ships during the quarter, the Submarine California and NSC-3 Stratton and we began to ramp up production of Virginia-class submarines to two per year. Overall, the third quarter demonstrated the strong momentum we’ve generated since the spin-off last spring. We continue to perform in line with our long-term expectations and we are excited about our prospects going forward. Now, I’d like to review each program in a little more detail starting with Ingalls shipbuilding. For the DDG-51 restart as I just mentioned, we receive the award for DDG-114, our second DDG award in just over three months. Obviously, we were very disappointed that we did not win the DDG-116 competition. Keep in mind that of the 62 ships to-date under the original program, Huntington Ingalls built 28 of them and we’ve been awarded two of the first four in the restart. Historically, we have a strong track record for quality and efficiency on this program and looking ahead, we strongly believe that with the management team and operating system we have in place and with a continued focus on cost reductions and efficiency, we will be competitive in position to win a substantial share of future DDG awards. On the LPD program, we successfully completed builders’ trials of LPD 22 San Diego and we expect to complete acceptance trials and deliver the ship to the navy by the end of the year. We continue to make progress on LPD’s 23 through 25, have begun construction of LPD 26 and are working under our long lead material contract for LPD 27. We remain on schedule to deliver LPD’s 23 and 24 next year, and LPD 25 in 2013. We are currently negotiating for the construction contract for LPD 27 and expect to have it in place some time next year. In the LHA program, we continue to make progress on LHA 6 with the successful translation of Modules 1 and 2 along with the past record 571 ton lift to erect the deckhouse superstructure. We expect the ship to be 75% structurally erected by the end of the year. And as I have said before, while we are pleased with the progress on the ship, we recognize that the majority of the risk lies ahead in the outfitting and testing phase of construction. We anticipate a contract on LHA 7 the next America Class Amphibious Assault ship by early next year. The third quarter saw a couple of key milestones for the national security cutter program, including the delivery of NSC-3 Stratton and the construction contract award for NSC-5 the fifth ship in the program. NSC-4 is also under construction and is progressing well. These ships have been well received by our customer the U.S. Coast Guard and we are very proud to be part of this important homeland security program. For the DDG 1000 program the team and our manufacturing facility in Guilford employs some of the most advanced composites fabrication technology in the world for the deckhouses and hangers for DDG 1000 and 1001. This proven technology combined with a highly skilled work force positions us to continue the program strong performance on the DDG 1002 contract expected to be awarded in early 2012. At Avondale, the work force there continues to perform very well and we are continuing with our plan of record to wind down operations. That being said, when we first announced this decision we emphasized that we deliberately decided to complete construction of the two LPDs being built at Avondale, LPD 23 Anchorage and LPD 25 Somerset to enable us time to work with federal state and local officials to explore redeployment opportunities for the skill and talented workforce at Avondale. In fact we just recently announced an agreement with the State of Louisiana, whereby the state would provide some very attractive incentives for joint venture. This agreement enables us to aggressively seek out a credible partner and a sustainable market and we will leave no stone unturned in this effort. Now turning to Newport News, in aircraft carrier constructions CVN-78 Ford is 29% complete and is over 50% structurally erected. During the quarter we erected the ships turn as a single 825-ton superlift one of the largest of the 162 major sections of the ship. The program remains on track and the ship is on schedule for launch in 2013 with expected delivery in 2015. On CVN-79 Kennedy, structural manufacturing, material procurement and design and planning are underway under the construction preparation contract. Although, there has been much speculation regarding the 2013 budget and the procurement of Kennedy, the current plan is to begin full construction of the ship in 2013. The RCOH for CVN-71 Roosevelt continues to go very well and due to expanded repair work scope from the navy under the contract the ship is now schedule to be the – to be redelivered in mid 2013. Advanced planning continues for the refueling of CVN-72 Lincoln and execution should begin in early 2013. For carrier inactivations, we are currently in the fourth year of the five-year planning contract as we prepare for CVN-65 Enterprise to enter the yard in mid 2013 for defueling of its eight nuclear reactors. On the Virginia-class submarine program, during the third quarter we delivered SSN-781 California, the latest submarine in the program more than eight months early. Commissioned two weeks ago California was described by the navy as the most combat ready of any Virginia delivery to-date. The first four of the block 2 boats have been delivered and the first four boats of block 3 are under construction. This includes SSN-787, marking the beginning of the programs two submarine per year build plan. For the company as a whole, our long-term outlook remains unchanged and we are on-track to achieve the targets we’ve discussed since the spin-off. All of our programs continue to perform inline with expectations. We continue to make progress on LPDs 22 through 25 and LHA 6, but risk remains on these programs. We are also seeing strong performance out of our other programs, such as the refueling overhauls, national security cutters, DDG-51s, LPD 26 and 27, aircraft carrier construction, fleet services and the Virginia-class submarine program. In the near-term, based on our third quarter results and what we’re seeing so far in the fourth quarter, we expect to finish out the year at a run rate of sales and earnings similar to what we’ve seen in the first nine months. Although, it is still early to comment in any detail on 2012, we still expect to post year-over-year improvement in segment operating margin as we begin to replace legacy contract revenue at Ingalls with revenue from new business. By the end of 2012, we expect to have delivered LPDs 22, 23 and 24, and do have made substantial progress ramping by VCS, DDGs 113 and 114, NSCs 4 and 5, and LPD 26. Margin improvement should continue into 2013 after we’ve delivered LPD 25 and LHA 6, the last of the underperforming contracts. Beyond 2013, we continue to expect our margin expansion to accelerate significantly on our way to our 2015 target of 9 plus percent. Before I turn the call over to Barb for a more detail on the financials, I’d like to make a few comments on the defense budget and the future of ship building. First, I wanted to emphasize that we have no crystal ball. We have no way of knowing exactly what the super committee might or might not do. While we do know however, is that the Navy and Coast Guard have missions all over the globe protecting America’s vital strategic interest. The fleet including the ships and personnel is already stretched to its limit in the effort to fulfill those obligations and to maintain the fleet and its mission profile going forward, our customers are going to have to do more with fewer dollars. We’ve heard the same speculation you have concerning defense budget cuts. Unfortunately in today’s deficit reduction environment, virtually every program is being closely evaluated and its cost is under the microscope. In the past few months, for example there has been wide spreads public speculation regarding various naval shipbuilding programs. But I encourage you to remember that is just that speculation. Until we see a final budget, we won’t know for sure the impact on our programs if any. One thing I will note however is that the discussions around the defense budget over the past several months have become significantly more thoughtful with respect to the broader implications of the cuts. What began as a sweep hypothetical strokes all depend to cut large programs looking primarily at the dollar amount directly tied to those programs has now evolved into more rational discussions that include the significant tangential effects of large program cuts. And although, I won’t comment on specific programs, rest assured that we are closely engaged with the Navy and Coast Guard during this process and we will continue to work with them to support their program needs in the most cost efficient manner possible. Lastly, it’s important to remember the context of today’s discussions and how from a timing standpoint, the resulting decisions may or may not impact our business. There are three distinct timeframes, the first zero to five years are already established, these are the contracts that are already in the backlog or that we are negotiating today. The debate right now is about the budget for 2013 and the results of that debate will become relevant in the next five to 10 years. Yeah, beyond all of that what is really being debated today is the question of what kind of Navy well we will have in 10 to 50 years. I’m confident, however, that HII is well-positioned to continue to support the Navy’s mission as we have done for more than 100 years. In summary, Huntington Ingalls posted another quarter of improvement in operating income, operating margin and free cash flow. Although, risk remains in the LPD and LHA six programs, we continue to make progress on these ships, as well as ramping up new business and we remain firmly on track to achieve our stated sales and margins targets. At Huntington Ingalls, our goal is to provide U.S. warfighters with high quality ships at the lowest possible costs and on or ahead of schedule, objectives that we believe will create substantial value for all of our shareholders. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb?
Barb Niland: Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. I’d like to briefly review our consolidated and segment results as disclosed in the press release then wrap up with some comments on pension. Before I get into our operational results, I’d like to discuss the goodwill impairment charge we took during the quarter. As you are aware, we normally perform a goodwill impairment test at the end of November or more often if certain criteria are met. We performed our last goodwill test at the time of the spin and we determined there was no impairment. However, as a result of the decline in our stock price and market capitalization in the quarter, we were required to take a closer look at goodwill to evaluate for impairment. We performed the relevant evaluations and although, our internal cash flow projections suggested a value above that implied by our stock price, the sharp decline in our market capitalization and decline in equity market multiples required an adjustment to goodwill. The $300 million non-cash of goodwill charge does not have an impact on our liquidity or debt covenants. And keep in mind that this is an estimate and is subject to adjustment in the fourth quarter as we finalize our testing. I want to emphasize what Mike said, our long-term outlook as not changed. This non-cash goodwill impairment charge was strictly driven by adverse equity market conditions. Now turning to the financials on slide four of the presentation, reported third quarter sales decreased $72 million from the same period last year and I will provide more details when I discuss each segment results. Including the $300 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge taken during the quarter, GAAP reported segment operating loss for the quarter was a $187 million. Total operating loss was a $190 million and diluted loss per share was $5.07. Adjusted for the goodwill impairment charge, segment operating income was $113 million and total operating income was $110 million. Total operating margin was 6.9%, compared to 4.6% for the same period last year. Adjusted for the goodwill charge diluted EPS was $1.05, compared to $0.86 last year. Cash from operating activities for the third quarter was $232 million, up $59 million over last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $36 million flat from last year. For the full year we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3% of sales. Turning to slide six, Ingalls revenue for the three months ending September 2011 decreased $19 million or 2.5% from the same period in 2010, primarily driven by lower sales in the DDG-51 program partially offset by higher sales in the National Security Cutter Program. Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, Ingalls operating income for the quarter was $19 million, compared with an operating loss of $1 million in the same period in 2010. Ingalls adjusted operating margin was 2.6% for the quarter, up from essentially zero last year. Turning to slide six, Newport News revenues for the quarter decreased $52 million or 5.6% from last year, primarily driven by lower sales volume on the Roosevelt RCOH and the Ford, partially offset by higher sales volume on the advanced construction contracts for Kennedy and the advanced planning effort on the Lincoln RCOH. Newport News operating income for the quarter was $94 million, compared with $90 million last year. The increase was primarily due to performance improvements realized on the VCS program, offset by risk retirement on the Toledo DMP in 2010 that did not occur in 2011. Newport News operating margin was 10.7% for the quarter, up from 9.7% in 2010. If you’ll turn to slide seven, I’d like to make a few comments on pension. Please note that pension related numbers are subject to year end performance and measurement criteria. So what we’re showing you here is simply to give you an idea of what 2012 pension could look like under certain conditions. This chart shows the sensitivity of our 2012 estimated FAS/CAS pension adjustment to the discount rate assumption and actual asset returns for 2011. And assumes an 8% long-term return on assets going forward, which is slightly lower than last year’s assumption of 8.5%. Given where we are today, our discount rate assumption would likely fall in the 5.25% to 5.5% range. With regard to cash funding and based on today’s conditions, we expect net pension contributions of roughly between $75 million to $100 million in 2012. That wraps up my remarks and with that, I’ll turn the call over to Andy for Q&A.
Andy Green: Thanks Barb. Chenille, we’d like to start the Q&A and just as a reminder to all the participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we can get as many in as we can.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi.
Jason Gursky – Citi: Hello. Can you hear me?
Mike Petters: You bet. Great. We can hear you, Jason.
Jason Gursky – Citi: Yeah. Thanks for taking the call guys.
Mike Petters: Yeah.
Jason Gursky – Citi: Mike, I’d love to just get some qualitative commentary from you if possible on why you think the DDG-51 award went away from you and what impact this might have on your ability to sustain flat revenue outlook over the five year period out to 2015?
Mike Petters: Well, as far as the outlook goes, we’re not changing the outlook based on this first competition. As I said, we’re very disappointed that we didn’t win that competition. On the other hand, this was the very first competition that we’ve had since Katrina happened. And we’ve been doing a lot of work over the last three and half years getting ourselves ready doing the things that we thought were important and we did measure up. But what we have now is we actually have a stake in the ground on a target to shoot for, before that we were doing what we thought was right and what we thought would make value and we made a lot of progress, we just didn’t get all the way to where we need to be. Now we have a target to shoot for, we look forward to the next competition. We congratulate the team at there, we wish them well and we’ll see them in the next competition, we’re energized to go get it.
Jason Gursky – Citi: Okay. Great. And then there was, I don’t know if you’ve had a change yet to see this report out today out in the press, but there seems suggestion that you’re going to a see 5% withholding on progress payments related to the DDG-114, due to some deficiencies and it sounded like management processes or something to that effect. I was wondering if you have any insights on that and what that means from perhaps an earnings and a cash flow perspective?
Mike Petters: Well, we have ongoing in all of our contracts we usually end up with some -- with several kinds of disputes with our customers over various issues. And this particular one, I think has to do with our earned value management systems, but we have range of them and those disputes and withholds are spelled out in our filings. Again, this is something we will engage with -- have engaged, frankly, with our customers on and we will continue to engage on. But as far as our outlook and flows for the business we don’t see this is having any effect.
Jason Gursky – Citi: Just to confirm there is no impact to cash flows or earnings driven by this in the near-term?
Mike Petters: Not to our outlook, no.
Jason Gursky – Citi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn, Credit Suisse.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning, Rob.
Mike Petters: Hi Rob.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Mike you talked about LPDs 22 through 24 delivering by the end of ‘12 and you also mentioned 9% margin in the Gulf by ‘15. Are there any timing changes here, was LPD 22 do this here and then the target on the margin, is that slipping to the right?
Mike Petters: No. There is no change, I mean 22 is, we do expect 22 to deliver this year and 23 and 24 next year. And our target has always been 9 plus percent in 2015, so no change there. The team is performing right on line and right on track with the plans that we’ve laid out.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay. Would you be able to give us some sense of how the margin plays out in ‘13 and ‘14, you’ve been clear that we shouldn’t look for much in ‘12, ‘13 is really where we see a bit of a jump just given the number of zero margin ships that depart in ‘12? But how do we think about ‘13, ‘14, ‘15 then?
Mike Petters: Well, without being terribly specific what we said is that 2013 is a point of inflection for margin improvement. And what will happen is these, by 2013 all of the underperforming contract work will be behind us and Avondale situation would be behind us at that point too. The new contracts will be coming on. Our bias towards conservatism on the front-end of new contracts, we’ll be ramping up on those contracts in terms of margin recognition, which is why we see this getting up to the run rate in 2015. So you think of 2013 is a point of inflection.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: And how do you think about 2012 guidance and timing on that guidance?
Mike Petters: At this point, I’m not sure that it makes a lot of sense for us to try to guide into this environment at all.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Is that largely due -- is that more due to what’s going on in Washington or is it the uncertainty around the Avondale closure situation, what?
Mike Petters: I would say, yes. I would say, yes.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: I mean is it...
Mike Petters: Yeah. I mean any one of these things would be completely assumption driven and so to have three of these things -- these three things, all of them being so assumption driven that, pick your set of assumptions you get a set of numbers. So from our standpoint that’s not effective in our communication plan and what we’re trying to communicate is that, we are – we’ve got our eyes wide open on what the risks around these different issues are.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just to finish up, to sustain you just had a great margin at Newport News in the quarter, I think everybody sees that? How sustainable are those performance improvements on Virginia and what else should we think about there and how do those margins go forward?
Barb Niland: Well, this is Barb. And I would say is, we have multiple ships under construction on the Virginia-class program and I don’t believe 10.7% is sustainable and ratable, but during the third quarter we had an unusual amount of favorable risk retirement primarily related to the delivery of California and then New Mexico completing the warranty period. But because we have ship -- six subs under construction at any point in time, we have different risk retirements across each one of their ships. So you will see some lumpiness in our return on sales on that program.
Rob Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks very much.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Access 342.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Yes. Barb, I saw the loss for -- provision for losses went down $21 million in the quarter, so you’re at $31 million now, so probably runs out in the first quarter next year except that LPDs don’t finish delivering till the end of next year. So, why won’t there be the risk of another charge that needs to be taken there?
Barb Niland: Well, we’re talking about risk associated with getting those programs out of the yard. But right now as we see it both LPD 23 and 24 are over 85% complete at this time and they are going to deliver in the latter part of the first half of next year, so we feel at this point in time those provisions are about where they need to be.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Okay. And then one question on inventories, they certain were better and your cash flow is very good this quarter. But they’re still seeing like they are too high. Can you just go through what’s happening there on a year-to-date is still up close to a couple of hundred million dollars?
Barb Niland: Sure. Not a problem. Yeah. Our cash performance was actually pretty good but that was really due to accelerated cash collections and just timing. Inventory is higher than the end of last year and part of it’s due to the – clearly Avondale restructuring costs. But also we talked about the performance on our LPDs and LHA 6 and that manifests itself in inventory with the retentions and the progressing on those ships. And so you’ll see a big change in that inventory as we deliver the ships. So right now we are just paying the price for that.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Okay. Thanks very much.
Mike Petters: Thank you, George.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Yes. A couple of questions to circle back on Newport News. Can you breakout what were the contract cumulative adjustments in the quarter and maybe talk about the driver of these 22% services margins in the quarter that was pretty impressive.
Barb Niland: Heidi, we are not going to break amount the numbers. But what I can tell you is, the biggest, the unusual events were just the delivery of California and then New Mexico coming out of the warranty period. So we had some pickups because we retired risks there. But across the program, we have different incentives, we have material incentives, scheduled incentives, small business incentives, as we retire all that risks we will have cumulative pickups there. When we make the complete modules and deliver modules, we’ll retire risk there. We will retire risk based on our cost performance, our labor performance. So it’s a constant watch across each of the ships.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: The services margins, can you talk to us about that uptick?
Barb Niland: The services margins -- there was a little bit of pickup related to a very tiny amount related to the Toledo DMP. And then in addition to it is just all of our Savannah River, the way we do that margin with no sale comes in and it’s just timing. I don’t expect to see that continue.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Should we think that the services margins is being more in the mid-teens on a sustained basis thus far?
Barb Niland: I think it will be a little less than that because of the aero funding that we received on the Savannah River contract and then that will start to be declining.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Mike a quick question for you and then I’ll turn it back over, a bigger picture as you sort of talked about the skyline and heading into kind of ‘13 and beyond and obviously the rollout of the previous port program. You’re sort of intimating more favorable contract terms versus the past, but help us understand across the industry we’re seeing evidence of much tougher contract terms going out of Pentagon? You have the F-18 multi year it has prior margins, KC-X signed fixed price development at zero and F-35 LRIP 5 which is at this stage not signable it should cost review by a half of -- share your thoughts, so what’s happening specifically in your contracting environment that is enabling you to drive your confidence that you’re going to be able to be seeing higher margins and better regencies through a defense budget down cycle?
Mike Petters: Yeah. It’s a great question Heidi. I think to answer that, lets go back and remember why we have underperforming contracts in the first place. The contracts that were signed on the LPDs and the LHA were signed in the aftermath of Katrina when the yard was being rebuilt, but the culture of the yard had been broken. And so the cost baseline that was assumed in those contracts was not correct. What we are doing, while we absolutely recognized the points that you made that there are certainly going to be different kinds of risk sharing, there is going to be different kinds of terms and conditions out there. The fundamental issue for us is, if we can get the cost baseline right that’s going to be a major improvement in where we’ve been over the last five years. And the contracts that we are negotiating today, we are negotiating those off of the cost baseline that we’re actually performing to today rather than, so we know what the cost baseline is for us to go get this work under contract. As I said you’re exactly right there are other pressures out there that if we were running at a full rate, I would say we would be in the same boat as everybody else. But we’re resetting the cost baselines right now in all of our contracting and so that overwhelms the effect that you talked about.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Good. Thank you so much.
Mike Petters: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
Mike Petters: Hi Sam.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Good morning. Barb you had mentioned 3% of sales for CapEx, which if you do on the order of $6.5 billion, I guess gives you about a $190 million of CapEx that’s a pretty big step up from where you’ve been running. Can you talk about what we might see in the fourth quarter there and why it’s going up?
Barb Niland: Well, you calculated about right and really it’s just kind of a normal phenomena vendor here all your vendors are going to getting their invoices and want to get paid by the end of the year, but also some of our work is completing towards the end of the year. So, we’ve talked about we were finishing that inactivations facility, we have the extension on [NLF] going on getting ready for the two subs a year. We’re buying equipment getting ready for the two subs a year because we’ve already started that second one. So, a lot of it it’s just timing at the end of the year and somehow the suppliers always get their invoices in at the end of the year to make their sales numbers to and as they complete the work. So, I look forward to be real.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Okay. And then when you mentioned the $75 million to $100 million of pension contributions how does that compare to this year?
Barb Niland: This year we just had a small amount of pension contribution so it is significantly more, the discount rates are driving that.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Okay. And I just one follow-up it’s just in -- I know you don’t want to talk about the Virginia class positive adjustment in terms of the size, but it looks like in the first quarter you had 7%, 9% now a 10% margin in Newport News which is a business that I would have thought would be generally more stable. And so when should we start to see something where there aren’t these big swings on a quarterly basis?
Barb Niland: Well, that’s the problem when you look at your business -- at our business on a quarterly basis it’s a little harder because of the lumpiness those with cash as well as risk retirements on the program. So, you really need to look at this business more instead of quarter-over-quarter but more year-over-year type look at the total year.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Hi. Good morning.
Barb Niland: Good morning Noah.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Is there something that makes your third quarter margins seasonally strong relative to the other three quarters of the year?
Barb Niland: Well, what we were just talking about on the Virginia Class, just the fact that we delivered California, we came out of...
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Well, I’m not talking about this year specifically, I mean on an ongoing basis every year. It looks like historically there has been some seasonal strength in the third quarter relative to the year, although it doesn’t happen every year. I’m just wondering if there is something that would drive that for the company?
Mike Petters: There is -- I would say no in general. I think you could note that the -- our third quarter is the end of the government’s fiscal year. And so there may be on a kind of a random basis there may be some effect of that that might have a little bit of an effect. But in this particular case, the fiscal calendars had nothing to do really with this. This was about work that we finished and risks that we retired.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Got it.
Mike Petters: It just happened -- it just happened to be this quarter.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Following up on the question before about tougher terms of trade with the Pentagon where you’re kind of saying that, your starting point for your cost basis is in a substantially different place. How do you think Mike about the risk that as you improve when you go back to the negotiating table at the Pentagon, they seem in a lot of other cases very willing to strongly suggest that they need to then reset the bar again on you and sort of have you shared a lot of the improvements you’ve garnered with the customer?
Mike Petters: I mean -- as we’ve talked many, many times when we go to negotiate a contract, we’re in that end of the business where we’re either our sole source supplier or we’re in a head-to-head competition with one other supplier. We are not in that end of the business where there 8 competitors out there who our and they’re in a pretty strong competitive environment which drives -- which drives the negotiations. So typically in our negotiations where we go into is, it’s usually less about price and it’s more about how we’re going share the risk that’s here. Neither one of us the government wants to buy the ships that we’re offering. We want to sell the ships that we’re offering, we want to try to find a way to share the risk, because by sharing the risk we are creating value for shareholders and we’re saving money for the tax payers. And so I think that -- that’s discussion of how are you going share the risk is what our negotiations all about. We get lost in all of this is that, if you sign a cost-type contract with the government the reality is, even if you only retire 80% of the risk and you have to increase the cost by some dollars for the 20% you didn’t retire. You save the tax payers in contracts you save that tax payers hundreds of millions of dollars, because if they had signed a price-type contract the price would have been 30% to 40% higher.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Right.
Mike Petters: So, that’s what discussion is all about for us really it’s less about the price and its how do you craft the contract in a way that makes sense for the tax payers and make sense for the shareholders. And, for me the center of that conversation is, do we have a common view of what the risk is, do we have a view and can we create a common view of how we’re going to share that risk.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Mike Petters: They want to put all the risk on me they have to pay me more for it.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Mike Petters: If they -- if we decide to share it then that can be mutually beneficial to both of us.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: That’s helpful. If I could just sneak in one other quick one for Barb, if I -- I might be looking at the math incorrectly here, but it looks like you’re saying the ‘12 discount rate would be down 30 to 60 basis points versus ‘11. If I just look at the Moody’s AA it’s done 125 basis points year-to-date, how do I put that?
Barb Niland: Yeah. Well, we take our discount rate-- we use a discount rate based on AA bonds where the duration matches the timing of our pension flow. So, I -- based on where discount rates are today and everything untitled get the lower end of our range we’re given you.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Barb Niland: So if -- I will know that from the end of the year, end of year we do our measurement and it’s every body’s guess what the market is going to do and where we’re going to be.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of [Dan Barsi] with Sanford Bernstein.
Dan Barsi – Sanford Bernstein: Good morning.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Dan Barsi – Sanford Bernstein: Just to go back to contract awards again, I mean you booked over $2 billion in awards for the quarter, but something we’ve been hearing elsewhere is that there has slowing progress on moving contracts forward. Are you seeing any signs of order flow being delayed or of orders you expected taking longer to be finalized?
Mike Petters: I can’t say, I mean what we’re talking about at this point in our contract negotiations are contracts or ships that have been authorized and we were and either been fully appropriated or mostly appropriated and we’re working our way through that. The negotiations are tough, but we don’t see that the things are being held back. If that’s what you mean.
Dan Barsi – Sanford Bernstein: That’s what I was asking, yes.
Mike Petters: Yeah. And we’re not seeing the effect of that. We’re seeing that things are taking a little bit longer just because of the -- the as I said before, trying to get this -- trying to get a common view of what the risk in the program is and then trying to find a way to make sure it makes sense for everybody. That takes a little bit -- that’s taken a little bit longer now, but that’s not a flow issue I don’t think.
Dan Barsi – Sanford Bernstein: And then, just turning to the next opportunity on DDG-51, when would that come up and when would you expect to be awarded?
Mike Petters: I see, I think that’s probably about this time next year is what I think the plan is at this point. But we’d have to I guess, we have to confirm that. I think that’s what it is and I think that the most important thing for our team right now is, the feedback loop that we got from this last competition allow us to go in and see what the opportunities are for us to be more competitive.
Dan Barsi – Sanford Bernstein: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line if Brian Ruttenbur with Morgan Keegan.
Mike Petters: Hey Brian.
Brian Ruttenbur – Morgan Keegan: Hi. Just a question just a follow-up to some of the other questions to get clarity, on G&A, can you talk about it in the fourth quarter you had a drop from quarter -- two quarter from second quarter to third quarter, can you talk about that just in the fourth quarter kind of near-term looking at your toes?
Barb Niland: Yeah. I mean, I hate to use the word lumpy all the time, but that’s just kind of the aware our businesses. I would look at not a significant change in the fourth quarter to the third quarter.
Brian Ruttenbur – Morgan Keegan: Okay. And then, most of your pension expense is going to be in the G&A line in 2012, because you are going to have that increase?
Barb Niland: We will have an increase yes.
Brian Ruttenbur – Morgan Keegan: And most of it will be in the G&A line?
Barb Niland: It will show, yes, yes.
Brian Ruttenbur – Morgan Keegan: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays Capital.
Mike Petters: Hi, Carter.
Mayur Manmohansingh – Barclays Capital: Hi. Good morning, guys. This is [Mayur] in for Carter.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Mayur Manmohansingh – Barclays Capital: My call dropped earliest so I apologize if the question I’m going to ask is -- was asked earlier.
Mike Petters: Not a problem.
Mayur Manmohansingh – Barclays Capital: Mike you talked about you captured 2015 long-term guidance the same in terms of flat revenues and 9 plus percent margins. With the loss of DDG well not winning DDG 116 we are just wondering, does this or were any other question that you may have had or that something else so that’s please as we look towards the sort of longer term forecast?
Mike Petters: Our general presumption in the DDG line is that we will win about half of those. And there is four ships have been awarded so far and we’ve won -- and we’ve got of them. We’ve obviously got another competition coming up and we’re getting ready to go do that. But the loss of this specific ship while it’s very frustrating, it’s also very helpful to my team will allow us to be even more competitive for the next, for the next go round. And all of that’s not going to have at this point -- at this point there is not, we don’t see any change, any reason to change our outlook for 2015.
Mayur Manmohansingh – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then you mentioned that most of the risk on LHA six lies ahead? I was just wondering...
Mike Petters: Right.
Mayur Manmohansingh – Barclays Capital: …if you can kind of give us some color in terms of how should we think about the freezing of risk on this ship? Where do you typically see kind of most of the risk is it the last 25% as most of that’s going to come up probably let’s say in the next quarter?
Mike Petters: Yes. I mean, I think that when -- on these kinds of programs particularly the LHA six program, you are going to -- you are going to recognize it from when you fight it on the ship and when you fight it on the ship is when you are in the test program. If you done the work, if things have come together the way they -- the way you plan for then the test program will validate the work that you have done. The uncertainty comes in because of the -- the nature of the new design work and the nature of the -- the way that we put in. Now we’ve work hard to improve our first time quality in the business and we’re doing very diligent work, the program team on that ship is working very hard to define the scope of work as they are going through the construction process. But its really when you get into the testing program that you can validate either a) we’ve retired that risk or b) we’ve got more work to go do before we’re done with the work. So that’s kind of why -- that’s kind of why its back-end loaded the way that it is.
Mayur Manmohansingh – Barclays Capital: Okay. And if I can sneak in one, final one for Barb, did you mention by any chance what you expect free cash flow to be for the full year?
Barb Niland: Okay. Good question. I talk about this all the time our invoices are pretty big and at the end of the year have a lot of invoices outstanding and its all based on timing. So very hard to give you a point estimate on that. If all goes well, I look for the trend to continue favorably, but we did have a great timing in the third quarter a lot of invoices were paid early. So I look at cash flow to improve a little bit.
Mayur Manmohansingh – Barclays Capital: Okay. Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro, Access 342.
Mike Petters: Yes George.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Just a follow-up Mike, it looks like revenue this year maybe coming at six or so, I mean is that going to be relatively flat next year and is there any color you can give it would seem like Newport should be up and the Gulf down if there is any color you could give on that?
Mike Petters: I mean, I consider that at this point to be relatively flat and we are going through a phase where you will see, the work ship from one side to the other. You’ll see -- in fact you already seen some of that. But over the long-term, we don’t see any reason to change the overall outlook for the business.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Okay. And next year you would expect the Gulf to be down and Newport to be up some to reach that flat kind of number?
Mike Petters: We haven’t provided any sort of guidance by division like that. We just kind of have kept it at the corporate level and said this looks pretty flat across the whole business.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Okay. Thanks.
Mike Petters: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question come the line of Pete Skibitski of SunTrust.
Pete Skibitski – SunTrust: Hey, good morning guys.
Barb Niland: Good morning Pete.
Mike Petters: Hello Pete.
Pete Skibitski – SunTrust: Mike, I was wondering if you kind of share with us how much incremental financial liability you could potentially incur with regard to this Avondale venture or the MOU with the State of Louisiana, because it kind of seems like it complicates the shutdown situation there and you start to think about the success the U.S. as had in commercial ship building. And so you wonder if you may be could incur a lot of liability there?
Mike Petters: Well, thanks for the question. We -- our plan -- our plan of record that we are executing today is that we are closing that facility. There are lots of reasons, lots of stakeholders who have hope for other outcomes. And we are very respectful of that. We purposely wanted to explore all of those other outcomes, because we’ve got great ship builders there and we owe them the chance to go and explore the possibility of other outcomes. The State of Louisiana has stepped up and said if you’re able to find another path the state is willing to create some incentives and so you could think about this as, we’re on a path to closure, but if there is another way the state would be -- they’re trying to find a way to incentivize that. What we’ve said from the beginning is that we got to have four things fall into place for us to do anything other than close the shipyard. The first is, we really do need a package of incentives from the state. And they come forward in a very big way and to compliment the State of Louisiana they are working very, very hard to try to help us find another outcome. The second is, that we needed to have some agreement with the Navy that we were under the far that we would be able to go and explore these alternatives without giving up our rights on as far as restructuring costs and closure and we got that. So that’s the first two of the four things we need. The last two things we need is, we need a credible partner and we need a sustainable market. Now, if you put those four things on the list you’d say, okay, which of these are the toughest things to get, the sustainable market and the credible partner are clearly the toughest things to get. And so and that’s where we are now. I don’t think there is any chance that we would be able to get a partner if we didn’t have the state working with us and we didn’t have the Navy working with us on this. But having said that, just because they are working with us it doesn’t mean that we will get one and so, as far as the complication goes, until we have partner if we have one and until we believe that there is some sort of sustainable market that that partner wants to pursue that we could support. We’re on path to closure and we’ve got that well scoped out, there is a program plan that we’re using, we’re -- unfortunately we’ve continue to layoff people and we’re closing shops there even as we go forward. So, it’s not the most elegant approach to the business, it’s what’s we owe to our fellowship builders at Avondale, the folks that are doing such great work we owe them. It’s our responsibility to make sure that we turn over every rock looking for possibilities here and stepping all the way back what we’re seeing is that there are lot of folks out there who are looking for sites to do manufacturing. And so who knows, we may be able to make something out of nothing here.
Pete Skibitski – SunTrust: Can you envision a scenario in which you retained majority ownership of yard post 2013 or is that kind of a long shot and your preference maybe the likelihood is, you’ll wind down your ownership for the nothing yard closed or not?
Mike Petters: Yeah. I’m not sure, I want to be that specific yet, I mean our aperture is pretty wide open to possibilities, but the reason the fundamental reason we’re looking for a credible partner and a sustainable market is, this needs to be in a place that’s not in the Navy work that we’re doing today. That means it’s going to be in some line of work that we’re not doing today, where we don’t have a whole lot of expertise and so we’re going to need somebody who understands the sustainable market that we’re looking for. They don’t understand what the key to success are going to be there, they understand how to -- how to drive and orient the process, so they can be successful. And so we would -- think of that more as a follow roll for us as opposed to a lead roll. But, our aperture is wide open at this point.
Pete Skibitski – SunTrust: Okay. Got it. If I could just one last question on a separate topic, can you share with us why sales volumes on the forward would be down during the quarter, we sort of in a transition mode between phases or something or was an issue of number of days in the quarter?
Barb Niland: It’s really driven by the engineering content is starting to decline a little bit and the construction is picking up, but we had -- last year full fledged engineering and construction going on at the same time. So, it’s just overall little decline in the engineering side.
Pete Skibitski – SunTrust: I see, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yilma Abebe with JP Morgan.
Mike Petters: Good morning.
Yilma Abebe – JP Morgan: Good morning. Thank you. One balance sheet question from me, given your cash balance and cash flow and expected cash flows going forward, can you comment on expectations for that pay down, even if you don’t want to talk about specific numbers and perhaps you can address generally your outlook on leverage?
Barb Niland: Well, right now what we are doing on the cash side is and we’ve been saying this all along, until we get these LPDs and LHA-6 out of here we are going to be conservative on our cash deployment strategy. We will look at starting next year we will start to take in a real hard look at a balanced approach and when we make that decision we will let you know.
Yilma Abebe – JP Morgan: Thank you. That’s all I had.
Barb Niland: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes the Q&A session. I’d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Petters.
Mike Petters: Thank you. I just want to thank you all for participating in the call this morning. Again we -- this was another great quarter of improvement for us in operating income, operating margin and free cash flow. We do still have risk on the LPDs and LHA-6 programs, but we are making progress on those shifts and we are ramping up our new business and that means that we are still on track with the plan that we’ve laid out at the beginning of this year. Our goal here at Huntington Ingalls is to provide our warfighters with the highest quality shifts at the lowest possible cost on or ahead of schedule. Those are objectives that we believe create value for all of our stakeholders. So thanks for joining us this morning and we look forward to seeing you in the future.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation. Thank you four your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Also in their remarks today, Mike and Barb will refer to segment operating income and total and Ingalls’ operating margin in the second quarter of 2010, excluding non-recurring items which are Non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these adjusted operating margins to the comparable GAAP measure is included in a schedule that accompanied our earnings release. We have posted presentations slides on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.huntingtoningalls.com and click on the investor relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release.  With that I’d like to turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Petters: Thanks, Andy. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on today’s call. I am pleased to report Huntington Ingalls Industries results for the second quarter of 2011, our first full quarter as an independent publicly traded company. Today we reported sales of $1.6 billion, down slightly over last year. Operating margin was 5.8% up significantly over last year, although last year’s operating income included a $113 million charge related to the Avondale wind down. Adjusting for that charge, operating margin was 5.4% last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.80 up from a loss of $0.23 a year ago. During the second quarter we continued to be awarded new contracts including the award for DDG-113, the first ship in the DDG-51 restart and well as additional work on the Roosevelt refueling and complex overhaul. Our backlog was $16.8 billion at the end of the quarter, essentially flat over last quarter.  Now walking through each of our major programs. For DDG-51 as I just mentioned, we received the contract award for DDG-113 and are in the process of bidding for DDG-114 and 116. We expect the next DDG-51 ships to be awarded later this year and we are pleased that the navy recognizes the value these ships bring to the fleet. This procurement, our first competitive program since Hurricane Katrina, provides the first external measure of our progress at Ingalls and also provides us the opportunity to demonstrate the advantages of serial production.  On LPDs, we anticipate builders’ trials and deliveries of LPD-22 by the end of the year. However, the navy is considering additional scope that could delay delivery into early next year. The LPD-23 was christened in May and LPDs-24 and 25 continue to make progress. As we mentioned on the last call, we have finalized the contract and began construction of LPD-26 and we expect LPD-27 to be awarded in 2012. As we communicated to you previously, LPDs 22 through 25 are challenging and we anticipate improved operating results once these ships along with LHA-6 are delivered.  As for LHA-6, we are making good progress and expect the ship to be 75% erected, meaning structurally complete by the end of the year, and while we are pleased with the progress on the ship, we recognize that the majority of risk lies ahead in outfitting and testing phase of construction. We also anticipate a contract on LHA-7, the next America class amphibious assault ship by year-end. Regarding national security cutters, we recently completed highly successful builder’s trials and are currently conducting acceptance trials on NSC-3 which is scheduled for delivery to the coastguard later this year. We continue fabrication work on NSC-4 and expect the contract award for NSC-5 in the near future. Our coastguard customer has expressed a high level of satisfaction with the 2 cutters that are currently operating in the fleet and in fact the commandant recently visited our Ingall shipyard in Pascagoula and was very complimentary of the team’s work on this very important program.  For the DDG-1000 program, we continue construction on the deckhouses, hangers and vertical launch systems for DDG-1000 and 1001 and we expect an award for the same items for DDG-1002 by early 2012. Our Gulf port facility, part of Ingalls is fabricating these deck houses, employing our unique knowledge and experience in composites technology.  In carrier construction, CVN-78 is approximately 26% complete and is now 57% erected. The ship is on schedule for delivery in 2015 and although we lowered our booking rate in the first quarter to reflect where we are in the program, our overall profit expectations for the contract remain unchanged and we are pleased with the ships progress. Ford, like most lead ship contract is a cost type contract that reflects the risk associated with building a new design and the sharing of that risk with our customer the navy.  On CVN-79, recently named the John F Kennedy and a second carrier in the Ford class, we have began cutting steel for the ship under the construction preparation contract for CVN-79.  In carrier refueling or RCOHs, we undocked Roosevelt during the second quarter and expect to redeliver the ship to the navy in late 2012 or early 2013. Advanced planning continues for RCOH of CVN-72 Abraham Lincoln and execution should begin in early 2013. This work continues to go well and HII is uniquely positioned in this business.  For carrier inactivations we continue to plan for CVN-65 enterprise to enter the yard in 2013. Enterprise will be the first nuclear powered carrier to be decommissioned and inactivated. This represents a new business for us, another area where we bring unique and highly specialized capabilities to the table.  On the Virginia-class submarine program, just this past Sunday we delivered SSN-781 California, the latest submarine in the program, more than 8 months early. The first 3 boats of block 3 are under construction and we have begun the process of ramping up production to 2 submarines per year. In the second quarter, we held the key link ceremony for SSN-783 Minnesota, the last of the Newport News block 2 delivery boats. As has been said numerous times by many, this is arguably the most successful ship building program today. It’s in true serial production and the teaming is going very well.  At Avondale, LPDs-23 and 25 remain under construction and we continue the early stages of implementing our plan to wind down the operation. I want to re-emphasize that this decision was made in light of the navy’s 30 year shipbuilding plan and an over capacity in the industrial footprint. We continue to see positive performance results on these 2 ships which is a testament to the quality of our shipbuilders in Avondale.  Overall, we are pleased with the progress we’ve made on each of our major programs. Our challenges with the LPD and LHA-6 programs remain a top priority and though our long term outlook for sales and operating margin remains unchanged from what we’ve said previously, let me provide some additional color. Because of the timing of the spin-off, the contract awards for DDG-113 and LPD-26 were delayed, which has created some pressure to the top line in 2011. Because of this timing issue we expect the second half of this year to look similar to the first half. Looking at 2012, we expect year-over-year improvement in operating margin as we begin to replace legacy contract revenue with revenue from new business. By the end of 2012 we expect to have delivered LPDs 22, 23 and 24, a significant portion of revenue that is now being booked at zero margin. As these ships roll-off we expect the associated loss of sales to be offset by progress on ramping up Virginia-class production in Newport News and construction of DDG-113 and LPD-26 at Ingalls, all programs which we expect to perform well.  As a reminder, we typically booked new business at a lower operating margin in the early stages of construction than we expect to average over the life of the ship. Then as we progress on the ship and retire risk, we generally see margins increase. This normal performance pattern should result in margins expanding slowly in 2012 and then beginning to accelerate in 2013 once the legacy LPD and LHA-6 contracts are completed and the new business has gained traction.  Before I turn the call over to Barb for more detail on the financials, I would like to talk a little bit about what’s happening in naval shipbuilding. As most of you are aware, in recent weeks there has been a lot of speculation regarding the shipbuilding budget, including not only the timing of the next carrier in the Ford class, the John F Kennedy, but also the navy’s long term carrier construction plan. Right now the plan of record is for CVN-79 to be funded in the fiscal 2013 defense budget with a construction contract being awarded shortly thereafter. We began preparing for the construction of Kennedy at Newport News several years ago and we are already steel for this ship under the construction planning contract. Because of the size, complexity and cost of an aircraft carrier, these ships tend to come under a lot of scrutiny when funding comes up for budget approval and Kennedy is no different.  Predictably, as part of normal budgeting process, various options related to new aircraft carrier construction where the size of the carrier fleet are always evaluated, but the ultimate outcome is only served once the defense budget is finalized and signed into law. It is important to remember however that the total cost of a carrier includes not only our contract for constructing the ship, but also the ship board equipment and systems that the government purchases through the nationwide supply chain. We believe that building these statements of national purpose on 4 year centers is the most efficient and cost effective approach for the navy and US taxpayer.  That being said, our current plan of building carriers on 5 year centers helps maintain much needed stability in the shipbuilding industry, including the supply chain and our own skilled workforce. Extending the carrier build cycle to 6 or 7 years not only increases the overall cost of the ship but would also have a severe and far reaching impact nationwide. At HII alone we purchase between $2.5 billion to $3 billion of materials from suppliers in nearly every state. These suppliers also typically provide components to other navy ship programs as well, so any negative impact on their carrier business also has a negative impact on their other navy programs and the cost to complete other ships.  In addition, the increasing pressure to reduce the federal deficit means every program, not just aircraft carriers is under scrutiny as the navy attempts to balance shipbuilding needs to funding constraints. How this ultimately plays out in a steady or declining budget scenario is unclear. What is certain is that naval shipbuilders are going tasked with providing the highest quality ships at the lowest possible cost. Importantly, the United States fundamentally remains a maritime nation with global economic and security interests.  As such our country will always have a strategic need to project power oversees and our navy will continue to be tasked with supporting that mission. Make no mistake, nothing projects power as effectively and efficiently as an aircraft carrier which has proven time and again its ability to support our country’s military, political, economic and humanitarian objectives worldwide and on very short notice. In fact aircraft carriers have been the backbone of the US fleet in maritime strategy for over two thirds of a century and we believe they will remain so.  From a more macro perspective, the range of missions that modern warships are required to conduct exceeds anything the ship designers ever contemplated, yet the flexibility designed into these ships, along with the best trained sailor and marines in the world enables them to accomplish these missions and what truly enables the flexibility of today’s navy results from what I characterize as volume at sea. By this I mean the ability to put large multi-mission platforms that can operate at sea anywhere in the world in support of our national interest, and today’s fleet is built around 4 major platforms that demonstrate this volume at sea concept each and everyday. Aircraft carriers, submarines, destroyers and large deck amphibships.  As the navy’s sole source providers of aircraft carriers and amphibs and one of only 2 providers of destroyers and submarines, we are well positioned to help the navy achieve its objectives on fleet structure and operational capability and the more successful the navy is, the more successful we are.  Let me reiterate that 2013 remains the critical inflection point for Huntington Ingalls as the Avondale shipyard winds down and LPD-25 and LHA-6 are delivered. Post 2013, we believe we will see the true earnings in cash flow potential of the business start to materialize uncluttered by the overhang of today’s problematic contracts. As such we remain committed to our target of 9% plus operating margin by 2015 on flat revenue which translates into significant growth in earnings per share and substantial recurring cash flow.  In summary, Huntington Ingalls posted year-over-year improvement in operating margins and cash flow this quarter. We remain well positioned to support the navies and coastguard shipbuilding requirements across multiple platforms of ships and submarines and we remain firmly on track to deliver the long term operating margin we’ve discussed in the past. Importantly, this quarter’s earnings demonstrates margin improvement at Ingalls and although we have challenges remaining, including the closure of the Avondale shipyard and completion of LPDs 22 through 25 and LHA-6, we are confident that we have the right management team and the right systems in place to effectively meet those challenges and create value for our shareholders.  And with that I will turn the call over to Barb Niland for some remarks on the financials. Barb.
Barb Niland: Thanks Mike and good morning to everyone on the call. I would like to briefly review our consolidated and segment results as disclosed in the press release and wrap up with some more detail on our capital structure and liquidity.  If you turn to slide 4 of the presentation, reported second quarter sales decreased $47 million from the same period last year, driven by lower sales volume on the DDG-51 program with the deliveries of DDG-107 and DDG-110, along with last year’s completion of the enterprise dry-docking. The lower volume was partially offset by higher sales on the LHA program, the national security cutter program and the advance planning contract for the CVN-72 USSA Abraham Lincoln RCOH. In addition, during the second quarter of 2010, the LPD program was impacted by the decision to wind down shipbuilding operations at our Avondale facility which resulted in a revenue reduction of $115 million to reflect revised estimates to complete LPD-23 Anchorage and LPD-25 Somerset. Segment operating income in the quarter was $98 million, up $108 million from the same period last year. Total operating income was $91 million, up from a negative $20 million. Total operating margin was 5.8% for the quarter, compared with negative 1.2% in 2010. Excluding the $113 million pre-tax charge related to our Avondale facility, total operating margin was 5.4% last year compared to 5.8% this year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.80 for the quarter compared with a loss of $0.23 last year. These figures are not necessarily comparable given the Avondale items in last year’s results and the higher interest expense this year from our new debt structure. Diluted share count was $49.6 million, an increase of about 80,000 shares quarter-over-quarter. The increase in diluted shares over the first quarter was unusually large due to the conversion of stock awards as a result of the spend, which had little effect in the first quarter as we only had 2 days as an independent company. Going forward, we expect diluted share cap to increase at a significantly lower rate.  Cash from operating activities for the second quarter was $186 million, up $91 million over last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $21 million, down from $28 million last year. For the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3% of sales excluding the $36 million paid to the State of Louisiana reflected in the first quarter. Turning to slide 5, Ingalls revenues for the 3 months ending June 30, 2011 decreased $6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily driven by lower sales in the DDG-51 program and partially offset by higher sales in the LHA program.  Operating income for the quarter was $19 million compared with an operating loss of $94 million in the same period in 2010. Ingalls operating margin was 2.7% for the quarter, compared with a negative 13% for the same period last year. This quarter results include negative cumulative margin corrections of $19 million on the LPD-22 through LPD-25 contract, partially offset by performance improvements on other programs. Excluding non-recurring items related to Avondale, Ingalls operating margin was 2.3% in the second quarter of 2010, compared with 2.7% this quarter. Turning to slide 6, Newport News revenues for the quarter decreased $41 million, or 4.5 %, from last year, primarily driven by lower sales volume on the Roosevelt RCOH and Ford, partially offset by higher sales volume on the advanced planning contract for the Lincoln RCOH. The year-over-year decrease was also driven by non recurring performance improvements realized on the Virginia-class submarine program in the second quarter of 2010. Newport News operating income for the quarter was $79 million compared with $84 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower overall sales volume and from the 2010 impact of the Virginia class submarine program that I previously mentioned. Newport News operating margin was 9.1% for the quarter, relatively flat compared to last year. Turning to slide 7 on capital structure, we ended the quarter with $910 million of total liquidity consisting of $381 million of cash on hand and $529 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our debt remained relatively flat over last quarter at $1.9 billion.  Interest expense increased from $15 million in the first quarter to $30 million in the second quarter due to the new debt structure associated with the spin-off. With regards to Avondale, we have updated our estimate of the total cost to complete the wind down from $310 million to $271 million. Our timeframe has not changed and we anticipate completing the wind down activities in 2013 once LPD-25 is delivered. We expect to submit our revised proposal to the navy later this month.  That wraps up my remarks and with that I will turn the call over to Andy for Q&A.
Andy Green: Thanks Barb. As a reminder before we start the Q&A we request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up so that we can accommodate as many people as possible. Crystal.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen (operator instructions). Today’s first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Good morning Mike and Barb. Could you talk about – you sort of did give guidance in time of the second half of the year being similar to the first half. But Mike what are the obstacles that remain here and getting even more specific. Is it Avondale and perhaps you can put the answer in the context of what Barb just said on the lower cost estimate now.
Mike Petters:  Okay. You know first of all as we’ve described the business over the past 6 months, there are a lot of moving parts and some of these parts get to be relatively large. It’s kind of lumpiness in the business I think is what Barb calls it. When we look back at the first six months of this year and we look at the things, we had some things that went well for us that were up ticks, we had some things that could have gone better which between those they all sort of netted out and they gave us a first half of the year that looks about what we think the business is going to look like for the second half of the year relative to our revenues and our earnings.  Cash flows are a lot even more lumpy than that and so we are a little bit more reluctant to talk about that one. But we think that the LPDs getting 22 through to delivery is a big deal for us here in the second half of the year. Our plan and our commitment is to drive it to delivery by the end of the year. The navy is working with us on that, but it’s – we are trying to jam a lot into the sock here towards the end of the year on that ship and so we will see how that one turns out. We are committed to making sure that that’s of the highest quality delivery.  Relative to Avondale, we’ve updated our proposal that reflects the experience so far. We’ve first put that proposal together, we were making some pretty conservative estimates on the things that – what things are going to cost us relative to this restructuring. As we’ve gone through and restructured and gone through the Tallulah and Wagman process and updated our estimates we’ve lowered our estimate for the total cost for the restructuring. So that’s just the evidence things are going pretty well.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Mike, how should we think about the talk that perhaps not all the cost is reimbursable or may be the better way to ask this is what is reimbursable? What do you expecting?
Mike Petters:  Well, let me first of all start it – this is a negotiation that will be going on between us and the navy throughout the whole process and so we have an estimate for what we think it will cost. The navy will have their estimate for what they think it will cost and we’ll be both working to refine those estimates, and so I think what is happening here is that you are getting a lot of early publicity I think around this negotiation, but I don’t know Barb if you want to add anything to that.
Barb Niland: We firmly believe all the costs associated with this restructuring are recoverable. The reason why you submitted proposal is what you do is you get an advanced agreement that you can include it in your rates on all of your new contracts that you bid and it’s all billable costs, but what happens in the end is after you’ve experience all the actual costs and you negotiate your overheads rates in the out years and close them out is when all the final decision will be made on that.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : So if there is eventually a disconnect between your proposal and what they reimburse, how and when would we see that book and where in your statements?
Barb Niland:  You’d see it way out in the out years after the closure, but again I will reiterate, we stand firm. Everything we put in our proposal is allowable and allocable.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Okay, thanks very much and Mike if I could just finish by asking you to update us on the Ford program and the discussion there about some overruns in your exposure there. Thank you.
Mike Petters: Sure. The Ford is the lead ship. Lead ships are always challenging. As I said last quarter and I said again today, we remain committed to our financial targets on that program. We’ve laid out some, a path for how we expect to retire risk on that program and things are going pretty well, actually the management team there is aggressively working to retire that risk and improve the overall performance on the program. It is a lead ship and because it’s a lead ship, we did a couple of things in partnership with the navy to get the ship under contract.  We set what I think are pretty aggressive targets for that construction and then we worked through how do you share the risk of the lead ship between us and the navy and the navy and the company remain committed to driving that program forward. From my own experience I have been involved with several lead ships. Quite frankly this lead ship is going better than any other that I have been involved with. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Access 342. Please proceed.
George Shapiro - Access 342:  Good morning. If you look at – this is probably for Barb, but if you look for the provision for contract losses which was $61 million at the end of the first quarter and now dropped to 52 and the $19 million provision was also in there so effectively it would have dropped by $28 million. Now it seems like that will finish maybe by the end of the year long before the LPDs get delivered. So will we see just the continuation of these small negative cum catch ups like we saw this quarter or how does that get wind up?
Barb Niland: Well, it depends how the programs progressed. I’d like to think that in a perfect world everything would go smooth, but we’ve said all along that those are our risk program in the LPDs and LHA-6 and that we have the potential for small corrections as we go forward. 
Mike Petters:  And George I would just add that LPD-22 as the first of those 4 LPDs, that one probably when we implemented our class plans and our operating system, it gets the least benefit of that and so as we bring that ship through to delivery, we are certainly rolling all of the lessons from that back into the other 3 ships of the LPD class that we are working on. 
George Shapiro - Access 342: Okay and then could you just update us on where you stand in your pension with the markets doing what they’ve done the last few weeks? Obviously returns are going to probably be less than expected and the discount rate is going to be lower. So maybe just give us kind of the sensitivities and how you look at that.
Barbara Niland: Sure. As you know our current plans established annually using assumptions based on the end of the prior year and we carry that through the year. So for modeling purposes along with a lot of different assumptions like with the pension accounting, we are using an average discount rate of 5.84% and we did assume long term asset returns of 8.5%. So that sensitivity would be look at a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have approximately a 12 million increase in the FAS pension costs and a 25 basis point decrease in the long term asset return would approximately have an 8 million increase in FAS expense.  We’re not providing guidance on 2012 as we’re in the midst of our annual operating plan process and we’re evaluating many scenarios associated with the recent market events particularly as they relate to pension. But another thing you have to consider too is that another variable in there that is difficult to quantify at the time is also the impact market performance would have to any CAS adjustments, excluding CAS harmonization. So that could potentially offset some of the negative earnings impact associated with changes in the discount rate or long term asset assumptions. It’s a watch item for us and we’ll certainly address it more next year as we come through it. Analyst Okay, thanks very much.
Barbara Niland: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
Unknown Analyst - Barclays Capital: Hi, good morning guys. This is Leo in for Carter. I just had a quick question here. You signed the award for DDG-113. I was just wondering if you can talk about any changes let’s say with this contract versus the prior DDG contract. So just as you’re going through the new contracting process in general if you’re seeing any sort of changes with the customer for anything that you’re implementing that helps protect I suppose your business.
Mike Petters:  Well I think first of all the DDG program has historically been a very successful program for both shipbuilders involved in it and I frankly would argue that the DDG program showed the benefit of serial production before the Virginia class program came along. There is a five- year gap in the production of destroyers and the 113 is the first ship following that gap in terms of the restart. During that gap, Dr. Carter put out some guidelines related to 50-50 share lines and ceilings and things like that that were absolutely brought to bear on this contract, but we were able to actually incorporate into our basis for the contract both what we thought the impact of the five year gap would be as well as what our experience post Katrina in our cost basis was and so that’s why we have the view that we’ll be able to perform pretty well in that program, a program that we’ve performed very well on historically.
Unknown Analyst - Barclays Capital: Great and just another question quickly, in Ingalls where you had the 19 million charge, you noted that that was offset by improved performances. I was just wondering, were there any sort of incentive fee benefits that were in the quarter? I don’t know if anything related to the delivery of DDG-110. Were there any sort of one-time benefits in nature?
Barbara Niland: There were no specific delivery incentives and everything, but after you deliver a ship you set up a small reserve for deferred work and things like that and so it was across a couple of programs where we didn’t spend as much money on deferred work and as we’ve come out of warranty periods we just had, it was about five or six different programs we had pick ups.
Unknown Analyst - Barclays Capital: Okay, great and just very quickly, any changes in the tax rate and how do we think about as deferred taxes going forward?
Barbara Niland: Let’s see. What you see right now for deferred state taxes I would expect to see about 3 million expense in each of the quarters going forward. The reason why you had 5 million going the other way in the first quarter was because we had two deliveries in the first quarter with Mississippi and DDG-110 and normally that would be ratable over the whole year. But because we had to close the books with Northrop we had to take that benefit in the first quarter.  So I look at the deferred state taxes being about the same as they are this quarter going forward. But again there can be swings based on timing of deliveries and timing of cost incurred, changes in reserves, things like that, so not a simple answer there. As far as their effective tax rate, basically from Q1 to Q2 the change we benefited a little bit by the domestic manufacturing tax deduction based on contract mix. But going forward I would expect it to be in say the 35% to 35.5% range. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
Jason Gursky – Citigroup: Good morning everyone. Two quick questions. First, Mike, maybe you could provide us with a bit of a history lesson dating back to the last time we went through declining defense budgets and reduced our overall fleet of ships and then out at sea. Walk us through what that looked like from the ship building industrial basis perspective and what that actually did to how long it took to build a ship or whether we ended up skipping some ships that were built. And then the second question is with regard to your 2015 guidance. You suggested 9% operating margins on flat revenues. I’m just trying to get a sense of when you say flat revenues, is that off of the 2010 full year revenue base or what you are now projecting for 2011?
Mike Petters: Okay, second one first. We’re looking at flat revenues off of the 2010 base. The timing of revenues for this year has shown up but I think that that’s not a sustainable impact. That’s just a timing issue. As far as the history lesson goes, now I feel old when I’m the one being asked for the history lesson here, but and I’ll try to convince this as quickly as I can. The challenge that you have when you start to decline the budget is that people want to stretch things out. They want to delay procurements or they want to delay schedules and what happens with that is that brings great inefficiency into the production line. What we saw for instance in our carrier production line was we actually started to move away from the four year centers of aircraft carriers. In the ‘80s we had two ship contracts. Imagine a two ship contract for aircraft carriers. We did that twice in the ‘80s and those ships, the last ship actually delivered in 1998. But starting with the follow on ship, the carrier program started to become stretched out. It went from four year centers. The 76 was the first follow on ship and that ship was delayed about a year. The 77 was the one that came after that and it was delayed a couple of years. The 78 came after that and it was delayed a couple of years and you could argue that in that timeframe when we bought three aircraft carriers we actually missed one. We should have bought four to keep it on the efficient schedule. Interestingly what happened is the Pentagon realized that they were getting to the point on the aircraft carriers that they were pushing the limit of what they really wanted to afford because of the inefficiencies that had been brought in by the schedule, and so that’s when they started coming back to the four year center or the five year center in their budgeting process. We think that that’s wise on their part to keep an eye on the balance between the inefficiencies created by stretching things out and the overall requirements of the declining budget. The challenge for the whole base is, what drives our business is the ability to capture those efficiencies of repeat performance and stability of orders and making sure that we keep our workforce intact and develop to do the follow on work. When you stretch out a program, instead of moving, I’ll take a destroyer program, you are the craftsman that works on the bow of the destroyer, you come off of that ship and you can go right on to the next bow unit for the next destroyer, you capture all of the efficiencies. You’ve got all those lessons learned in your head, the learning curve is there. If you have to wait a year, you may not even be the person we put on the next bow for the destroyer and so that’s where the, in a kind of a nutshell is the challenge that we will have if things start to stretch out. It becomes a knowledge management issue and it becomes a question of how efficient is the learning curve. You can assume that you’re going to capture 100% of the learning once you start moving the programs out and I think that’s really what the Navy is wrestling with right now is where do we create the efficiencies, how do we preserve the efficiencies that we have.
Jason Gursky – Citigroup: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning. I wanted to continue on the fourth for a little bit because we’ve seen, there was a report out this week talking about a 562 million increase over the target price due to what they say are construction inefficiencies. Perhaps could you talk about what this may refer to? Is this anything new? Is it related all to what you assumed in the first quarter when you adjusted rates? What’s happening here?
Mike Petters: Yeah. As I said before Doug, this is a new class of ship. When we took the ship on, it’s not, this isn’t a new class of a small ship, this is a new class of the backbone of the fleet. There’s new technology throughout the ship. The design parameters and the key performance parameters change the shift pretty dramatically. When you set down and say okay, how are we going to go contract for this ship? The discussion that we have in the contract negotiations is all about how much risk is there.  As it is the lead ship there’s a substantial amount of risk and so then the question is how do you want to share that? Does the contractor bear all of that or does the government want to share in that? If the government and the contractor come to an agreement on how we’re going to share the risk, you can actually drive the cost down in terms of the price and so what we’ve done is we first of all as a baseline set a cost plus type contract and that then helps us manage the cost performance on the ship. We then have risk provisions that allow us and the government to work for achieving those targets. The performance on the ship right now is pretty solid. I’ve been on the ship very recently and I like what the team is doing, the things that they have in place, the initiatives that they have to mitigate the impact of this being a lead ship and so from my standpoint it’s going pretty well and let me reiterate, our financial performance targets on this program have not changed. When we came though the first quarter we decided not to take credit for retiring risk yet because we weren’t satisfied with what we’d seen, but that didn’t change our overall targets. We’re confident with where we’re going today and I think that Newport News's performance as evidence in this quarter report is that they’re on track.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: So you’re saying that this report coming out regarding an overrun is nothing inconsistent with what you’ve been seeing and what you’ve been working with the customer on doesn’t really affect your margin outlook for it?
Mike Petters: Yeah. I’m not going to comment on any particular story that’s out there. I would just say that we’re very confident with the financial performance on that program.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: And then on the DDGs, could you talk about the dynamic of the competition for DDG-116 being a competition and DDG-114 being one that’s designated for you? How does this work in terms of your pricing basically when you’re competing on 116 and how does that affect your thinking on 114?
Mike Petters: Doug, we’re in the middle of a competition here so I’m not sure that I really want to talk about my pricing strategy. I would say that I am very pleased with the Navy’s approach to this and I think that this shows that the Navy understands the value of serial production that we’re trying to put in place. That if we can get the rhythm going on destroyers, we can recreate the successful program that carried us through the last 15 years or so on that program. I testified last year to congress that the plan the Navy had for buying three destroyers every two years was unstable. I believe that we ought to be buying two destroyers a year and so my hope is that we’ll be able to show the value of serial production here which would then afford the Navy the opportunity to go do that.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: But if you look in the Gulf and say the Avondale charges which we understand those should be allowable costs. When you’re competing on this program, do those allowable costs, even though you can put this into your rates, does that change your competitiveness at all?
Mike Petters: The competition is basically our total value competition and so that’s something that we have to go deal with.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, great. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Please proceed.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS: Good morning. So just to get back to Newport margins for a second, if I look back to 2010 it looks like in the first half of the year your margins at Newport were in sort of the mid 8% range and then in the second half they look like they’re implied up above 10 and then so I was just wondering what exactly caused that step up in that period and how does that kind of reconcile back to what you were saying about this year’s second half looking pretty consistent with the first half?
Barbara Niland: Yeah. As with all our contracts and everything, we do have little one-time events or what I would call unusual events type thing. So as you particularly on the Virginia class submarine program, as you come out of your post delivery work and you complete deferred work with less the hours than you had planned or you deliver a ship and you retire risk, you have pickups as you retire those risks as you go forward. So we saw a little bit of that going on last year.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS: Okay, thanks and then on the change to your estimates to close Avondale, I know a part of that $310 million was cash and then another part of it was related to an asset impairment. Is the change, the reduction to 271 all basically a cash impact?
Barbara Niland: Most of it, yes.
Darryl Genovesi - UBS: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley:  Yes, good morning Mike and Barbara. How are you? Good. So a couple of questions. Thanks for giving us some color, Mike on your thoughts on 2012 and I just wanted to delve a little bit more into it if you don’t mind. Can you give us a little bit more color on the puts and takes between the two major yards as we think through next year? In other words, does Newport News stay more or less flat from a margin perspective and the margin that you’re talking about is principally at Ingalls or what are the puts and takes that Newport News as well next year that we ought to be aware of?
Mike Petters: Yeah, I think you’ve got it about right, Heidi. The Newport News folks are at the level today that we think they’ll sustain. There may be as Barb just pointed out, there may be one time events that will occur from time to time there that would help, could be better there, but generally that’s kind of the rate that we expect them to sustain. The real issue here is the rolling off of the forward loss contracts that we have on the LPDs. Delivery of 22 is a big issue for us, getting that done this year.  That will have an impact on this year and if for whatever reason it moves into first quarter it will be a timing issue, but getting it behind us is a very important thing to do. But we are seeing really good work being done right now on 23 and 24 and we expect to deliver those by the end of next year and so if you kind of fast forward to where we are at the end of 2012, we’re down to LPD 25 and LHA 6 and so that and we will have started up the 113 and the LPD 26 and as we’ve been talking about, LPD 26 is a standalone contract at this point that presumes the cost base line post Katrina and so we’re expecting to perform at our normal and historic levels on those programs for shipbuilding, not just inside the LPD program. So really it’s the rolling off of the work in Pascagoula and Avondale that’s going to drive the performance next year.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Great and then on CVN 78, you talked about being 26% complete now. As we again think forward the next kind of 12, 18 months, what are the potential milestone awards that you have? Are there some in ’11 or do some occur in ’12 and include in your answer where you’ll be in terms of percentage completion by the end of ’11 and by the end of ’12.
Mike Petters: Yeah. We’re into that process of the ship now where we’re building the ship in the dry dock and for the next couple of years as we head towards the launch, that’s basically the volume of the work. I think the launch is scheduled in 2013 and so between now and then that’s basically what we’re after is get the ship manufactured. Our objective is really to make sure that that launch is as high quality launch as we can have, that we’ve got as much completion as we can possibly create. As we’ve seen across all of our programs, the more outfitting that we can do prior to launch, the better performance on the ship. So overall we’ve got some pretty good targets there, but the next major milestone on that program I would say is the launch in 2013.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Okay. So there won’t be any cumulative catch-up adjustments through the progress you make in 2012? Is that kind of what you, is that a better way to understand that?
Barbara Niland: It depends on performance against our plan. Performance in outfitting, how we’re doing with schedule, Heidi, there is a lot of moving parts there. We look at it every quarter.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: No, absolutely. I was trying to understand if there were certain things you get done that enable you that you had an agreement with the Navy that you would get milestone awards when you hit certain junctures.
Mike Petters: No. this is all about are we ready to take credit for retiring risk that we have in the program and we get to a point where we think that we’ve retired a certain amount of risk then we’ll step up. If we uncover new risk, then from time to time we might have to step back. We don’t anticipate at this point either of that. Between now and launch we’ll be doing those evaluations every quarter and we’ll see how that goes. But we’re pretty happy with the performance on that program today in terms of what the team is doing, how they’re executing the program and the way ahead.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pete Kostiuk with Morgan Keegan. Please proceed.
Brian Ruttenbur - Morgan Keegan: Yes, thank you very much. This is Brian Ruttenbur with Morgan Keegan. A couple of questions just on, back to the history lesson. How much did budgets get cut as you stretched out those carrier fleets in the ‘80s to give us the rest of the history lesson? You talked about maybe one ship didn’t happen because of the stretch out. Can you give us percentage cuts per year during the last downturn?
Mike Petters: Yeah. I don’t know that I have any; I don’t have any good feel for that. The shipbuilding construction account has been relatively flat for many, many years since, I’d say since at least the latter part of the ‘90s and frankly if you looked at it decade by decade our perspective is that not sure how all these things are going to play out, but in order for the Navy to achieve its plan the decade ahead probably is a little better funded than the decade we just came through because in many Navy programs we’re going to be moving into serial production and producing ships, whereas over the last decade across the fleet there’s been a lot of lead ship construction and less serial production, so fewer ships were produced. So I’m not sure, I don’t have off the top of my head a year by year where the budget went, but I think that typically it’s been I think fairly flat.
Brian Ruttenbur - Morgan Keegan: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Takacs with SunTrust. Please proceed.
Rob Takacs – SunTrust: Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. Can you provide me with the breakdown of backlog by segment?
Barbara Niland: Sure. Let’s see. At Ingalls the total backlog is 5.6 billion and at Newport News it’s 11.2 for that total of 16.8.
Rob Takacs – SunTrust: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Today’s final question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank:  Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. A couple of clarifications. First, the size of the positive adjustment in the second quarter on these five or six ships, what was the offset to the 19 million negative?
Barbara Niland: A little more than half.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: A little more than half, okay and then back on pension, the other clarification as it relates to funding in years. I know required funding this year is negligible. What does the funding profile look like from a mandatory perspective today and then Bard do you have a sense of the sensitivities if you close the book today?
Barbara Niland: Yeah. We’re really not providing any of that information for the out years. Like we said, minimal pension funding requirements this year. I think it’s like $3 million for non-qualified plans, none for our qualified plans. So as far as the out year goes we’re not providing any of that information right now.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Okay and Mike the real question, as you go into the next negotiation on the CVN 79 on a fixed price basis, can you give us where CVN 78 will be? When you think the timing for the contracts would be and kind of how you’re approaching that contract given obviously you wouldn’t have been all the way through the 78 year?
Mike Petters: Right, and this is not atypical frankly. We’ll be at a point, assuming the plan of record that we would be negotiating this contract probably, it’s a 2013 ship so that’s the year we will be negotiating the contract, the end of ’12, beginning of 2013. Lots of data coming from the 78 to show us where we still think the risk might be in that program and as I’ve said a few times, this is a program where it’s sort of, there’s only one builder and there’s only one buyer.  So we quickly have to get into a negotiation that is not so much about the price because we kind of know what the budget for the program is, then it’s a matter of how are you going to allocate the risk on the program and that’s the way we think about all these negotiations when we go into them, is what’s the way that we’re going to equitably share the risk or bear the risk. If we’re going to bear the risk it’s going to drive our price up. If there’s going to be risk shared it’s going to drive the price down. So that’s the way we think about it Myles and they all, every single negotiation I’ve been involved with has its own flavor.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Any reason to think that when kind of the initial booking rate on that contract is signed it would be much different that what Newport News is currently booking?
Mike Petters: Our booking policy won’t change on that program. I’m sure that once we sign that contract we will book conservatively. We will have a full view of what we think the risks in the program are and as we retire them we’ll book up.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Okay, that’s good. Thanks. 
Operator: That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to hand it back to Mr. Andy Green for closing remarks.
Mike Petters: Yeah, well just let me say thanks to all of you for being on the call today. As I said before we do remain well positioned to support the Navy and coastguards requirements across all of their platforms and we remain firmly on track to deliver the long term operating margin we discussed in the past. I think this quarter demonstrates the path that we’re on and we look forward to working with you in the future. Now, Andy?
Andy Green: That concludes the call. Thanks everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.
